[ LIGHTS UP ON THREE PEOPLE SITTING ONSTAGE, just relaxing, perhaps watching TV. Pause. ]

1:
Oh boy.

2:
Are there any movies on?

3:
I'll check.

[ 3 changes channels. ]

[ A slide on the screen, showing a face in black and white in the manner of the Steve Jobs memorial image. “Mark Gergle: 1963 - 2016”. ]

HOST
What was it that made Gergle unique among his generation of computer innovators?

GUEST
He yelled. A lot. He yelled at me personally and he yelled at me as part of a group. Whenever we’d show him anything, anything at all, he’d yell at us about it. He’d yell all kinds of visionary things at us: that we were fat, lazy, stupid, virgins, morons, ugly morons, gay morons, gay virgin morons. And then when we’d make the changes he requested, he’d yell at us about those, too.

I think the difference with Mark is really … the yelling. I’m not saying that he was the only tech CEO who yelled at his employees, but no one yelled more, and for longer, and with as much personal viciousness as Mark did.

JOEL:

CURTIS:
Excuse me?

JOEL:
You heard me.

CURTIS:
I think that bears repeating.

JOEL:
I just learned who was responsible for the outrageously divine film "Madea Goes to Jail".

CURTIS:
Fair enough.

JOEL:
Have you seen it?

CURTIS:
No.

JOEL:
Do you want to watch it now?

CURTIS:
No, Joel.

JOEL:
How about after the show?

CURTIS:
No!

[ JOEL pulls out a date book. ]

JOEL:
What are you doing tomorrow?

CURTIS:
Joel, I don't want to watch "Madea Goes to Jail." I don't want to watch it now. I don't want to watch it after the show. I don't want to watch it ev-er.

INTERVIEWER
Despite being widely recognized as one of the most gifted actresses of your generation, Oscar gold has eluded you.

SHABLEEN
Well, for me, it’s all about the work, not the recognition. I know that some people assume that it must really get to me. But believe me, it’s not something I think about. Not when I’m choosing roles, not when I’m filming. The work always comes first with me.

INTERVIEWER
But some critics have suggested that your recent career choices reflect a desire to finally clinch that Best Actress Oscar.

SHABLEEN
That just isn’t the case. It’s not something that enters my mind.

INTERVIEWER
Of course. So, tell me about this new movie.

SHABLEEN
Well, it’s a very inspiring true story. I play Marge Magiddle, a recovering heroin addict and proud transwoman. When the racial tensions in her hometown explode into civil unrest and violence, Marge is shocked to suddenly find herself crushed under a 500-pound pile of smelly dishrags.

INTERVIEWER
Wow.

SHABLEEN
I want to be clear: I did it. For the movie. I spent most of the filming at the bottom of a pile of incredibly smelly, damp dishrags. It was insane.

INTERVIEWER
That’s really something.

SHABLEEN
I pushed myself for this movie, is what I’m saying. I pushed myself far as shit.

INTERVIEWER
It sounds like you really pushed yourself.

SHABLEEN
You better fucking believe it.


[Two gentlemen in old fashioned swimming suits with large moustaches.

They glare at each other, size each other up, grimace.

They approach each other slowly, in a half-crouch.

1 extends his right hand, high in the air.

2 extends his left hand, locks its fingers with 1's right.

They circle each other, holding their free hands at the ready, fingers waggling.

1 thrusts at 2 with his free hand. Without breaking the lock, 2 pulls backward to avoid it.

1 follows through with his body, giving 2 an opening. 2 jams his fingers into 1's armpit.]

2: TICKLE FIGHT TICKLE FIGHT TICKLE FIGHT TICKLE FIGHT!

[1 collapses to the ground, curled into a ball. 2 waves his fingers in front of 1's nose.]

2: [melodiously] Now smell your armpit! Now smell your armpit!

[A WOMAN enters in a tattered antebellum dress.]

W: All our men, they thought it was a time of glory. A time to fight proudly for the only world they knew. But some of us knew the truth. Knew that God held us in his reckoning and was passing down his judgment, that all the sins of the past would be paid in the blood of brothers, spilled by their own kin.

[1 scampers off. 2 pulls out at piece of paper and a crayon.]

2: Dearest Belinda.


[ SOUND CUE: Bitcoin intro ]

[ DIM/BLUE LIGHTS UP ]

[ Everyone standing equally spaced onstage. ]

V/O
Ladies and gentlemen, we present sketch comedians Adam Hilton, Courtney Hopkin, and Curtis Luciani.

[ They each raise their hand and wave when mentioned. ]

V/O
Together, they are Your Terrific Neighbors. But one of these three has a secret.

[ They look at each other. ]

V/O
One of these three individuals is the mysterious inventor of the online currency known as Bitcoin.

[ They now stare at each other, fiercely. ]

V/O
And at the end of tonight’s show, that person’s identity will be reveal--

COURTNEY
It’s me.

[ LIGHTS NORMAL ]

COURTNEY
I invented the Bitcoin. I did it.

CURTIS
Courtney, why?

ADAM
Why, Courtney?




COURTNEY
Ever since I was young, I dreamed of a type of money that was on, in, and for computers. I spent years hoping the dreams would stop. They were so boring! I even went to a neurologist to ask about removing the dreaming part of my brain. It was such a stupid, boring dream. But then I figured the dreams wouldn’t stop unless I made them real.

ADAM
Did it work?

COURTNEY
No. Same shitty dream every night.

CURTIS
Well, unfortunately, this mystery was supposed to be the structuring element of tonight’s show. It was supposed to tie all our jokes together.


CURTIS
Adam?

ADAM
Yes, Curtis.

CURTIS
Let me lay a premise on you.

ADAM
Lay it on me, brother.

CURTIS
Courtney hasn’t been the same since she spent that weekend at that scenic Hill Country bed and breakfast.

ADAM
You know what, Curtis?

CURTIS
What, Adam?

ADAM
I’m gonna go ahead and plus-one you on that premise. Courtney hasn’t been the same since she spent that weekend at that scenic Hill Country bed and breakfast.

CURTIS
Here she comes now.

ADAM
Let’s play it cool.

[ COURTNEY enters. She is wearing a peach basket strapped to her chest. She is eating peaches, but also dipping them in a jar of peach preserves. ]

COURTNEY
God damn it, it’s another beautiful day. Have a peach!

[ She tosses her current peach (already half eaten) to Adam. ]

COURTNEY
You too, buddy.

[ She pulls another peach out of the basket, takes a big bite, dips it in jelly, takes another bite, dips it in jelly, tosses it to Curtis. Curtis sniffs it. ]

CURTIS
Is that peach jelly?

COURTNEY
Fresh peaches in peach jelly. It’s like a double sunrise in your mouth. The sun comes out, but it turns out there’s a second, smaller sun hiding behind the first sun.

[ Curtis bites the peach. ]

CURTIS
Yow! It’s hot.

COURTNEY
Yeah, I microwave the jelly until it’s molten hot. To complete the sunrise metaphor.

[ This goes on for a bit. Sketch ends with a member of the audience getting a chance to throw a basketball into Courtney’s peach basket for a prize. ]

People often ask me about my hobbies. Heh! Well, I’m a bit of a dabbler, really. Kind of a tinkerer. A jack-of-all-types type, you know? It’s like, there’s so much to do out there, how can anyone pick just one thing?
You know, I like to dibble dabble on the old saxophone, you know, just see what happens. See what kinds of sounds come out. I don’t have training or anything, but it’s just fun, you know, hearing your breath turn into music. So that’s one thing.
I also like to bibble bobble on the old pottery wheel. You know, just toss some clay on it, get it moving, see if anything comes of it. Sometimes it’s fun just to make shapes, you know? Not everything’s got to be some big project, you know. There’s plenty of people out there who can make beautiful vases, or whatever. Me, I’m just trying to enjoy the creative process.
Sometimes I like to have a little ribble bibble dooble down the street on the old bicycle. Never learned how to ride, mind you. Don’t care to learn! For me, it’s just about climbing on that machine without a plan and letting instinct take over. It’s about bringing my inside outside, and the bicycle is just the avenue of expression.
Every once in a while, I’ll have an old ribble-robble chimmery coo on a major demolition site. You know, I don’t know where the explosives should go, I don’t know anything about “safe distance.” I just know that knocking down a 20-story housing project, whether you’re qualified to do it or not, is a great way to blow off some steam and experience some “me” time.

NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH

The neighborhood watch organization is a pleasant trio (Curtis, Courtney, and Adam) who just love to watch stuff. They have no sinister or protective intent; they just really love watching things. They take us from sketch to sketch. (“Let’s go watch this now.” “I heard Mumford and Sons are having a concert at the Pep Boys Center Arena.” “I’d love to watch that.”)g

Transitions are the Neighborhood Watch, with some pleasant music.

NARRATOR (V.O.): In July of 1861, a union soldier named Sullivan Ballou wrote a letter to his wife Sarah. While the majority of this letter has remained as a testament to the love these men felt for the ones they left behind, researchers have recently uncovered a never before seen postscript to that letter. We present that postscript tonight.

(Lights up on Sullivan Ballou writing a letter.)

SULLIVAN BALLOU: … And so, my dearest Sarah, I shall always be near you; in the gladdest days and in the darkest nights . . . always, always, and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath, as the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by. Sarah do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again. Your devoted husband, Sullivan.

(Pause.)

SULLIVAN BALLOU: P.S. Do not have sex with anyone after I am dead. Also, be sure to pay the grocer back for that ham. Don’t forget, Sarah -- I know how apple-headed you can be. Grief is no excuse for forgetting to reimburse someone for a ham. What else, what else … oh! Don’t go in my study. Trust me on this, Sarah. If you need something from the study, blindfold yourself and navigate by touch until you find the item or items you need. Touch nothing on the desk. Upon exiting the room, immediately close and fasten all twelve door locks. Finally, bury a saucer of cream and a saucer of blood behind the house at midnight of the next full moon. Turn thrice widdershins and pray every night to someday forget any sounds or smells you may have experienced while in the study. You know what, don’t worry too much about all this. As I alluded to earlier, I shall return to haunt you as a ghost. I will be there to ghost-help with dusting or floor maintenance, or to occasionally manifest myself and scare away anyone with which you try to have sex. I’m probably forgetting some things … you know what, I’ll just jot them down in the steam on the mirror while you bathe.

NARRATOR (V.O.): Sullivan Ballou died a week later at the Battle of Bull Run. His letter was never delivered, but his ghost remains, and is currently on tour with his latest book, “How to Get ‘Em Crazy Wet: A Guide to Romantic Letter Writing for the Married Man.”

BARRON: [ crying and holding FITZ's dying head up ]
I told you to be coolio about the burgers. Why couldn't you? Why couldn't you just find the line? You just had to go and be a crimshaw, you stupid baby! Aw, FITZ, aw no, I'm so sad.

Intro where Courtney interrupts to send a text. She wins execution game.

A LAWYER (L) AND HIS CLIENT SIT AT A TABLE (C)
 
L: Ladies and gentlemen, your honor, men and women of the jury, I am not a liar.  So I can NOT tell you that this man is NOT a monster.  That would be a lie, and as I said 5.8 seconds ago: I am not a liar.  I also can Not, in good conscience, say that this pathetic excuse for a man is NOT a villain.  His villainous deeds have preceded this very trial.  And, as I said 28.2 seconds ago: I am not a liar.  What am I then, you ask.  I am a taxpayer, voter, a father of four.  I am a law abiding citizen.  I'm NOT a discarded prophylactic filled with the wasted orgasmic fluids of a troll-like beast tossed in a ditch and left to rot in the heat of the noonday sun.  But do you know who is?  He's in this room right now.  He's looking right at me.  He smells of garlic and infection, and he is what haunts our nightmares.  He is why we lock our doors at night.  He is why we walk our children to school.  He is why I missed my little girl's boring dance recital last Wednesday.
 
CLIENT CLICKS HIS TONGUE AS HE SHOOTS LAWYER WITH A FINGER GUN.  IN  RESPONSE LAWYER GIVES A THUMBS UP CLOSE TO HIS CHEST.
 
So what do we do?  What do we do with a piece of society's trash?  Honorable men and women of our community, I am asking you to decide the fate of someone who refuses to obey our most basic laws.  It's not my responsibility to decide his punishment. I am already bogged down with responsibilities of my own. 

C: Yeah, cause he's got those nice kids, and this job, and stuff. He keeps his car clean, too.  That takes time.

L: The decision is not mine to make. His life is not in my hands. It's in the hands of the viewers of channel 7!  (LAWYER POINTS TO THE AUDIENCE.  LAWYER AND CLIENT ARE ILLUMINATED AND BEHIND THEM A WHEEL OF FORTUNE WHEEL APPEARS.  THE WHEEL IS DIVIDED INTO 4 SECTIONS: HANG ME!, ELECTROCUTE ME!, WILD CARD!, TEXT MESSAGE!)
 
Remember, if our studio audience spinner lands on wild card he or she may choose any hand held object under 12 inches long to use in the bludgeoning booth.  If it's text message, you at home can text to win the opportunity to bash his head in with this rock.
 
CLIENT: Kill ME Saturday at 8pm, folks.     

YOU GO

[ Long pause. ]

GIRL:
You go.

GUY:
No, you.

GIRL:
But here's the thing ... you.

GUY:
I understand, and you make a compelling point. However, you.

GIRL:
No, but see, think about it: you.

GUY:
Listen listen listen listen hey ... shhh, shhh. You.

GIRL:
I can't even hear what you're saying, because: you.

GUY:
My heart is beating in fear, and it's going youyouyouyouyouyouyouyouyou.

[ This goes on for a bit. ]

GUY:
Wait.

GIRL:
OK.

GUY:
This is stupid.

GIRL:
It is.

GUY:
If you go, I'll give you a million dollars.

GIRL:
Baloney.

GUY:
Look. I know how ridiculous it seems that I would have a million dollars, especially since I told you I had a million dollars before and it wasn't true then. You need to put that aside. Because I now have a million dollars. I do. For real. And I will give it to you.
[ Girl gets up and wanders around the stage as if looking for the hoard. When she realizes she has run out of places to look she trudges toward the door with a weak battle cry and is immediately killed.

SOUND FADES OUT. ]

GUY 2:
My life is 100% the best.

[ Woman is sitting at a table, with a large sketchpad. She has a pencil and is sketching furiously. Maybe she takes a drag on an e-cigarette, slams a bit of coffee. ]

WOMAN: That’s right; you got it; you got it. This is where Patrolman Piggy arrives on the scene. “Little lemur, are you lost? Are you lost, little Lemur?” And here’s our benevolent piggy. Real smile on his face, kind eyes. This is what he looks like. This is what he looks like.

[ Sudden realization. ]

WOMAN: Jesus, Sheila, what’s wrong with you? The policeman character can’t be a pig, for Christ’s sake. Jesus, Sheila.

[ She starts erasing, furiously. ]

MAN: [ offstage ] Ay Sheila! What the hell are you doing those doodles for? It’s B-E-D bedtime, righ-now!

WOMAN: Shut your mouth or I’ll come stitch it closed with your own guts!

MAN: I love you, you crazy idiot!

WOMAN: I love you and now shut up!

MAN: Don’t fall asleep with the lights on, OK?

WOMAN: I do what I want! But OK.

[ She goes back to work. ]

WOMAN: It’s crazy, this life. The city’s asleep and here I am, drawing animals in human clothes. Animals in human clothes, who could even imagine such a thing? But it’s what I see whenever I close my eyes. Some people don’t get it. My Charlie … sure, he can’t read, no job, no manners, half an animal, only cares about that old broken-down Chevy in the garage … But my Charlie gets it. He encourages me to draw these crazy stories that I think kids will really respond to. And Are You Lost, Little Lemur? … I think this is the one. This is the one that gets me over, for real. This is the big time, baby. Little … lemur … lost. How did no one bend over and pick up that idea? All this time, sitting right there, waiting to be picked up by one Miss Sheila Rose Smilebuttons, of humble origins in west Fuck-All, Nebraska. They can’t ignore you after you blow down their doors with this one, Sheila. Can you smell that, Sheila? It’s so close I bet you can even taste the smell on your tongue, Sheila. It’s right there. The fucking Caldecott Medal. It’s gonna be yours. It’s gonna be yours.

[ She closes her eyes and reaches in the air for it. In pantomime, she takes a long moment to smell it, puts it in her mouth, chews it gingerly, than eagerly. ]

WOMAN: How does it taste, Sheila? You’re eating it. You’re eating the Randolph Caldecott Medal for most distinguished American picture book for children. Now it’s part of you. It’s in your stomach. Your body’s breaking it down, taking little bits of it into your blood. You and the Caldecott Medal have become one.

[ Suddenly she snaps out of her reverie. ]

WOMAN: Patrolman Platypus!

[ She starts sketching again. ]

Joel: it's "all" shit
Curtis: Joel, thoughts?
 Joel just gave me his throughts
Joel: courtney?
Courtney: Have you ever had like...a quarter bottle of cardamon?
Curtis: Thoughts?
Courtney: and like
 an eighth bottle of oregano?
Joel: what is cardamon?
Curtis: every day; what of it?
Joel: ginger?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Courtney: it's part of the ginger family
Joel: like your hairs
Courtney: yes, like my hairs, Joel
 well, so say
 you have these spices and you're all
 "why do I have all these containers!?"
Curtis: Right; I want to free up some containers.
Courtney: "I can just put them all in one container!"
Joel: bingo
 all spice
Curtis: This was especially important in the past, when people had fewer containers overall.
 Because there was no store for them.
Joel: before plastic was discovered
Courtney: right
Curtis: But wait!
Courtney: but then people became.....
 fond of this "all" spice
Joel: we discovered the container store
Curtis: Also, it turns out Courtney is lying
Courtney: righto, Joelyo
Curtis: "Allspice, also called Jamaica pepper, pepper, myrtle pepper, pimenta,[1] or newspice, is a spice that is the dried unripe fruit ("berries") of Pimenta dioica, a mid-canopy tree native to the Greater Antilles, southern Mexico, and Central America, now cultivated in many warm parts of the world"
 That's from wikipedia, y'all.
 Also:
Joel: why are we talking about all spice?
Curtis: "The name allspice was coined as early as 1621 by the English, who thought it combined the flavour of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves."
Courtney: That's basically what I said
Curtis: In 1621, they thought that cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves = all the spices.
Joel: our link is cinnamon
Curtis: That's right Joel
 Now come over here, you big lug
Joel: people in 621 = idiots
 *1621
Curtis: touches Joel
Joel: Curtis, stay away from me, Curtis
Courtney: soothes Joel
Joel: "I'm soothed"
Curtis: makes Joel an allspice tea
Joel: "Soothed with the all spice of love"
Joel has left


COME PICK ME UP



[ LIGHTS UP. STEPH SITS ON A BENCH talking on a cell phone.

CURTIS ENTERS and stands center stage. ]

CURTIS:
The following sketch was inspired by a true story. These events took place on or about the day of May 19th, in the year of our lord 2009, outside Longhorn Laundry on the intersection of 45th Street and Duval in Austin, Texas. Though these events are formally undocumented, eyewitness testimony speaks to the truth of the account which we will present.

[ CURTIS EXITS.

Steph's dialogue begins in the middle of a conversation. JOEL ENTERS and sits on the same bench. He slides slowly towards her until their shoulders touch. He slowly turns his head and looks at her. STEPH's conversation ends and she hangs up. ]

JOEL:
Can I use your phone?

[ STEPH ignores him. ]

Can I use your phone?

STEPH
Hmm?

JOEL
I see you have a cell phone.

STEPH
Yup.

JOEL
Can I use it? It would be for just a second.

[ STEPH ignores him again. ]

Can I use your-

STEPH
Fine. Use the phone, just keep it short.

JOEL
Thanks.

[ JOEL takes the phone from STEPH and dials. ]

JOEL
Hey. It's me. ME! Can you pick me up? What? Come pick me up. I'm on 45th and Duval. Come pick me up. I have two broken ankles I can't walk. Come pick me up. You're going to make me walk on my broken ankles. Come pick me up. I borrowed somebody's phone. I'm using somebody's phone. I couldn't use a pay phone. Then I would have had to bum 50 cents. Collect? Would you have accepted the charges from me? See! Come pick me up. What? Come pick me up. It's me. Come pick me up. They took my shoes and broke my ankles. THEY did. Pick me up. Just pick me up. Why not? Oh. Just come pick me up. I'm on fire right now. Come pick me up. Please? OK. Bye. Here.

[ He hands back the phone. ]

Women, right?

[ CURTIS ENTERS. ]

CURTIS:
The writer of this sketch never saw that homeless gentleman again. And yet, he could not help but feel that their lives had been forever linked in some deep and undefinable way.

[ Beat. ]

OK, that last thing I said might be bullshit.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]


[ Funk music plays. Senator is dancing, wearing large novelty sunglasses. ]

Yeah, all the aides tell me I’m different from the other senators. I dunno, man, I dunno, I’m just doing my thing!
My advisors told me, “Frank, you’re running for public office. High public office. You know, being a senator is a pretty big deal! You know, there’s an expected way to behave.” I asked them, “What’s a senator do?” And they said, “A senator makes laws.” “Exactly, boys. I make the rules. So I can make a few of my own.”
You know, the thing is, people like to see someone doing his own thing. I think America is a country that has historically been known for doing its own thing. This is me. I can’t hide it. I don’t know how. You take it or leave it.
It’s weird. My advisors were really against the idea of me doing my thing. They told me, “It’s just not done like that.” They were on this real downer trip about the whole thing. But voters responded to it immediately. They danced right along. And the media had fun with it, too. Sure, some stuffy old squares acted all uptight about it. You know, millionaire donor types. We had this fundraiser, with all these rich snoozes. I come in there, and I’m just doing my thing, you know, like I always do. And they all just froze. They had their mouths open, like they couldn’t even believe what they were seeing. Thank god, there was one lady, like the oldest and richest lady there, and she was REALLY into it. Like, it turned out that she was also someone who likes to do her own thing. Anyhow, she bankrolled my whole campaign.
The debates were a little tricky. My advisors wanted me to read all these binders, that they had put all these dumb facts and things I was supposed to say into them. No thanks, man, not my style. So I just went out there, and I spoke from the heart, you know? Just said things the way I understood them. My opponent was like, “blah blah, budgets, blah blah, foreign policy, blah blah, catastrophe,” but I kept connecting the questions to things that I knew from my own life, things that are a big deal for me, you know, trying to pop it off with a lady while you’re both waiting in line at the genius bar, or customizing your jacket, or maybe a touching anecdote about a pet I once had. That pet had a funny name. I dunno, my advisors thought it would be a disaster, but I only got the biggest standing ovation in the history of political debate, so?
Anyhow, being a senator’s fun. You get an office. There was an iPod dock when I moved in here. I have no idea whose it is, but I’ve been using it. It’s great!
I’m thinking about running for president, though. I don’t think I can keep this up, and being president is supposed to be easier, I think. I’m not sure if I heard that right, but I’ll take a chance. I hope they let me keep this iPod dock.

- Have some aides come in to ask about specific issues. He either stays in his persona, or he breaks it.
- Making a big deal out of putting his feet on the desk. “Everyone put your feet up! I don’t care if you’re comfortable.”
- Aide starts to take his feet off the desk. Senator: “Hey … do your thing, man! Do it.”
- “I don’t want to see anybody with their feet down. No feet on the floor.”
- “The only thing hitting the ground is our new ___________ policy.”


HEMINGWAY



[ LIGHTS UP on BARRY and JILL reading books. JILL's book is entitled "Compendium of the Shortest Short Stories Ever Told on the Planet Earth by Human Beings in the 20th Century" ]

JILL: [ still reading ]
I don't get it.

BARRY: [ still reading ]
Get what dear?

JILL:
This is supposedly the shortest story ever written. It goes: "For sale. Baby shoes. Never worn."

BARRY:
That's all?

JILL: [ flipping pages ]
Yeah.

BARRY: 
Let me see that.

[ takes the book from JILL ]

That's not much of a story.

JILL:
I don't think that qualifies as a story.

BARRY:
Well, what does ol' Webster have to say?

[ JILL reaches for a dictionary. ]

JILL:
Story. "An account of incidents and events."

BARRY:
Hm. Perhaps there's a page missing.

[ JILL takes the book back from BARRY ]

JILL:
Well, the page numbers are still right.

BARRY:
Okay, lets assume this isn't a typo. Let's assume there aren't pages missing. What could it possibly mean?

JILL:
"For sale". Okay, someone is selling something.

BARRY:
Right. What are they selling?

JILL:
"Baby shoes". They're selling baby shoes.
BARRY:
Okay. That satisfies my question.

JILL:
"Never worn". And that's it. Why would one sell baby shoes that have never been worn? Is there something wrong with them? Perhaps that should be elaborated on in the ad.

BARRY:
Yes, some explanation as to why they're so dissatisfied with the shoes that they were never worn.

JILL:
On top of that, really, they're passing off a newspaper ad as a short story? I mean, supposedly HEMMINGWAY wrote this story! If that's the case, I've written many a short story! I could create my own short story compendium!

BARRY:
You should, dear!

JILL:
Oh Barry, you're so funny! You know what? I will. I'm gonna finish all these "short stories" and send them back to the publisher! Maybe he'll appreciate that someone is willing to do the work that these writers were too LAZY to do! 

BARRY
Or drunk, dear!

JILL:
That's right, or drunk. Okay, I'm starting with this one: "The last man on earth sat alone in a room. There was a knock on the door..." He answered it. It was Marty. Marty had on a raincoat and......[ improv out ]

[ LIGHTS OUT ]


(Lights up on a MAN, putting up groceries in his kitchen. He looks up and notices the audience.)

MAN:
Oh hi, I didn't see you there. How you doin’, friends?

(Pause.)

Hahaha! That’s terrific! Say, have you heard the news? Darryl and Louise are expecting their fourth! And it looks like the town council is finally gonna get round to fixing that sinkhole behind Freddie's Feed Lot and Sweater Bar.

(Pause.)

Me? Well, to tell you the truth, friends … I am low. I am as low-down as a man can be … ever since the Devil started following me around. I first noticed him while I was walking down Blue Holler Drive one day. Out of the corner of my eye, behind a newspaper machine, I saw the Devil! I said, “What you looking at, Devil?” Devil said nothing. So I said, “You trying to buy a newspaper, Devil? What the Devil want with a newspaper machine?” Devil had no answer for that. Put his hands in his pockets and walked away looking real sad like.

After that, I ain't seen the devil for two weeks! That is, until I caught the Devil rootin’ around in my garbage. I run out and I screamed, “You get out ‘a that garbage there, you Devil!’ And the Devil, hoo! He like to ‘tore up both sides of the street he run away so fast. Pointy little tail floppin’ behind him like a sad flag.

I thought that was the end of it, friends. But that Devil, he got bolder. He started showin’ up at the liberry, at Sammerson's All-Nite Cabinets, even at the green grocer! Always actin’ like it was a coincidence we just happen to keep bumpin’ into each other. Each time I saw him I yelled, “You get out a’ this here green grocer, you Devil! You get out!” And each time that Devil slunk away, to the land where only devils go.

It was gettin’ so I couldn’t go out my own front door without seein’ that Devil. So, one mornin’, as I was taking my Sienna down to Mindy's Toyota on 49th to get its brakes serviced -- you know the one -- who do I spy next to the service station donuts but that horny ol’ Devil. Now you and I know the Devil ain’t got no car. I put down my coffee, I put down my Thrifty Nickel, and I walked up to that Devil. All a’ sudden that Devil made like he was checkin’ out the wallpaper, checkin’ his watch. That Devil was obviously uncomfortable. And for the first time, friends, I felt sorry for that fiend. I put my hand on the Devil’s shoulder -- surprisingly cool -- and I said, “Devil, why you hauntin’ me?” Well that Devil, he took out a solid gold hanky -- had the words “Ol’ Devil” embroidered real pretty in the corner -- and, wipin’ a wisp of smoke from his eye, he said, “For the comp’ny … for the comp’ny.”

Well, I asked that Devil if he needed a ride home. He asked if we could stop by CVS, and I said okay. Devil’s been crashing at my place since then. Keeps talkin’ ‘bout how he’s gonna get a job, maybe take out a small business loan for a food trailer, all so he can pay me rent. But you and I know that Devil ain’t payin’ no rent.

(The man picks up a nearby box of crackers, shakes it. It’s empty.)

DeVILLLLLLL! You get over here!

(Lights down. The end!)


[ LIGHTS UP. Two people sit in the living room of an apartment. One is wearing a lab coat and glasses. The other is wearing a wizard cloak and hat. The Wizard is eating potato chips. The following song plays as they sit and stare. ]

This is a story about two guys
They’ve known each other for a long time
They’re friends
Best friends
They’re friends
Best friends.

Joseph was always the studying type
He did well in school but not in life
And when he earned his PhD
He found what would make him happy
He’s a scientist
Looking for love
He’s a scientist
Looking for love

Bryan was always up to no good
Raising hell in the neighborhood
He was always told, “You can’t do that”
And then he found that magic hat
Bryan’s a wizard
he can do magic
He’s a wizard
all they way

SCIENTIST
I love Breanna but she doesn’t think of me in that way. I need to get her attention, but how?

[ Canned laughter ]

WIZARD
Why not read an incantation from the sacred scroll, you know, use magic to make her love you. It worked for me and Monique and she’s never been happier.

[ Monique enters. She moves as if invisible strings are moving her body against her will. She is forced to move to the wizard, bend over, and kiss his cheek. She is then forced off stage. “Oohs” from the audience play. ]

SCIENTIST
Oh yeah, that’s not creepy.

[ Recorded hysterical laughter. ]

I know. I’ll use my science know-how to cure that terrible disease everyone is complaining about. That will impress her for sure.

[ Canned laughter ]

WIZARD
I don’t know, man. That sounds like a lot of work to me. Monique! Bring me my gogurt!

[ Monique enters against her will carrying a tube of gogurt. ]

[ Music continues ]

Now they’re roommates
They live together
Science and magic.

ALL DUMBO'S FAULT



[ LIGHTS UP. A man sits on a bar stool. He is drunk. He has been drinking most of the day. The drunk smokes a cigarette and holds a glass of whiskey. ]

DRUNK
Hey. Buddy. What's that? What is that, your tenth, eleventh? I'm not judging. Look at me. I've been right here drinking. Same as you. What's the problem, huh? I've got mine. He's got his. Everyone here's got at least one. What's yours? Wife left you? Kids hate you? Laid off? Fired? What? I'm so sorry. Me? The wife left me, kids hate me, I was laid off. Fucking Dumbo. 

You know, cartoon elephant flies around. Dumbo. That movie fucked me up. Oh sure, you think it's funny I have such strong feelings towards a kids animated movie. It messed with my head. Little fucker, so close to losing his mother because of his freakishly large ears. I never let my mother leave my sight after I saw it. It really did a number on me. Try showering with your mother when your twenty years old because you're afraid the circus is going to lock her away if you can't see her. Fucking Dumbo.

You're right, it's stupid of me to blame an animated movie for my problems. The Absent Minded Professor, now that fucked me right in the head. Not the movie as much as my experience with the movie. My dad made me watch it when he found out I got a D in chemistry. He told me it was the greatest tale of man achieving his dreams, and the best movie based on a true story. It was devastating when I found out flubber didn't actually exist. I never trusted my father after that. He lied constantly. When he died, I sat next to his grave for two days thinking that at any moment he would pop out of the ground. "Fooled ya, son. You're so gullible, like your mother." Fucking prick.

Of course, of course it's not Disney's fault my father was a pathological liar. But Disney did make Pete's Dragon and is therefore responsible for.... Now, I have no problem with Pete's Dragon. It didn't mess with my head like Dumbo. It wasn't the subject of one of my father's lies. This movie screwed up my childhood because Charlie Miller liked it. I was bullied at school by Charlie Miller. He was the biggest kid in class, and he hated me. However, after watching Pete's Dragon, he took quite a shine to me. Charlie invited me to play with him after school, and when we met up he told me that I was going to be his pet dragon. I immediately ran, of course, but he was so fast -- and strong.

[ The drunk takes a quick shot of his drink. ]

He stripped me nude, painted me green, and rode me around town while I growled and flicked matches at people. This occurred very frequently. I thought Charlie would eventually get bored with the idea but the people loved it. It was like some kind of fucked up parade.

Fucking movies, man. Fucking Dumbo. I'm sorry, buddy. I've been talking your ear off. Let me buy you a drink you can tell me about -- oh, look at the time. I gotta run pal. There's a midnight showing of Fantasia, and this dick ain't gonna masturbate itself. Well ... no, probably not.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

You can squirt it over your sausage, pour it over your pancakes, or finger it until it comes on your ice cream
What does that mean you finger it until it comes on your ice cream?
You know, you put your finger in the bottle and get things flowing, and then you put it on your ice cream



Segments between
- Courtney argues about the cues
- we talk about the crew’s tap dance recital
- Regis is gonna fill in

[JOEL comes onstage.]

JOEL: Let's change the mood here. I want to do something a little special for you guys. This is a one-man show I just wrote, and I'm still workshopping it, you know, work in progress, but I'm feeling a very special energy in this room, and you guys have just been so giving tonight, that I'm gonna do it right here, right now. Ladies and gentlemen, my tribute to a great poet, this is "The Day that John Berryman Died" --

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Do Baby Joely!

JOEL: Haha. Uh, maybe a little later, ma'am.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: I came for Baby Joely; I wanna see Baby Joely!! Say, "this poopoo's for REAL, y'all."

JOEL: Ma'am, I haven't done Baby Joely for five years. I'm a lot older now, and I'd like to think ...

AUDIENCE MEMBER: "Hey, mama, you best pop that titty in my mouth!" [Laughs and goes for high five from fellow audience members.]

JOEL: Ma'am. Please, just sit and enjoy the show. If you like Baby Joely, I'm sure you'll love "The Day That John Berryman Died," a journey into a great poet's tortured psyche.

AUDIENCE MEMBER: Fuck. That. Noise. "Party's at my criiiiiib, bitches!" [Guttural yell.] Baby Joely!! I gotsta have it!

JOEL: MA'AM! You are free to go home and listen to any of the seven Baby Joely albums I've recorded and released online, or my collection of Baby Joely prank calls, or read selections from my long-running blog written in character as Baby Joely, but--
 
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Excuse me. Can I intervene here?

JOEL: Uh ... what?

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: I think we should all be more respectful.

JOEL: Thank you.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: I really think that you owe it to this drunk, unruly woman to abandon whatever you had planned and do Baby Joely.

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY-BY JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOE-LY!

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Let's be reasonable.

JOEL: Look, I'm flattered. I'm very flattered, but --

AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Baby Joely.

JOEL: I think I've explored that character adequately --

AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: When I say "Baby," I say "Joely." BABY JOELY!!

JOEL: NO, NO, NO! Listen. That's not me anymore. I am a creative person. I am sensitive. I am an artist. Yes, I dare to use that antique name, caring nothing for accusations of pretension, for it is a good and honorable name! It won't buy me fifteen cheap and tawdry minutes of YouTube celebrity, but it can purchase something greater, the satisfaction of knowing that while others cried out for me to trod the same familiar ground time and time again, my heart blazed a trail forward to new frontiers!! The satisfaction of knowing that, among the slugs and worms, I was a magnificent butterfly! And who are you, who are you ma'am, to say that this butterfly's wings are not beautiful!! That these wings cannot carry me to the heavens of inspiration! I am no moth, that must stay in the dark of old hackneyed routines for fear of perishing in the blazing light of genius!! I ask only one thing: that you take flight with me and join me in those heavens above!! Burst from your chrysalis and together we might flutter, lovely butterflies all!! JOIN ME!! Join me, or I will leave you behind!!!

[Pause. Audience member 2 initiates the slowest slow clap in the history of slow claps. Audience member 1 joins in ... and this eventually becomes a chant of ...]

AUDIENCE MEMBERS: BABY JOELY!! BABY JOELY!! BABY JOELY!!

[Joel breaks down, puts thumb in mouth, grabs ear.]

JOEL: Maaaaaaaaan, fuck all ya'll!

AUDIENCE MEMBERS: BABY JOELY!!!

PROUD



[ LIGHTS UP ON STEPH, wearing some very "patriotic" clothing and waving a little American flag. ]

STEPH:
I am a proud woman.

[ Beat. ]

I know a lot of people these days who aren't proud anymore, and it makes me so sad, you know? It makes me wonder where all the pride went.

I remember that when I was a little girl, there was plenty of pride to go around. Sometimes you'd realize that an entire day had gone by because you were so proud that you lost track of time.

And not just special days, either, not just the Fourth of July or Memorial Day or Presidents' Day or Flag Day or VE Day or VJ Day or San Jaun Hill Sunday or Manifest Destiny Week, which they used to have on the second week of November every year back in those days, and you could always get ten percent off at all the major department stores. But anyway, we still had plenty of pride left over after all those days.

On odd years, of course, you'd store up some extra pride for the Olympics, but there'd still be plenty left over to be proud on certain days just because you felt like it, because maybe there was a new cowboy picture in the theaters, or Grand Funk Railroad had just released a new album, or the great Ronald Reagan had faced the nation with his inspiring words, or McDonald's brought the McRib back for another few months.

[ Beat. ]

Well, I don't care how things are these days. I'm still proud. I'm proud of my home, my family, my church, my community, my country, my God, my body, my self.

[ She waves the little flag harder. ]

Why am I so proud? Why wouldn't I be? This is only the greatest country on God's earth, and the earth is the most favored of all of God's planets. God thought the earth was so great when he was making it that he surrounded it with a vast, seemingly infinite universe filled with billions of stars, and billions upon billions of planets, all of which are totally unimportant and exist to emphasize the fact that earth is the greatest!

[ Waves them harder. ]

And God, who I mentioned, who made the earth, is like the greatest guy ever! I want you to think of the best guy that you know -- like maybe there's some guy in your neighborhood who's really mature and has a great job, but he also looks super handsome for his age and he's always really really helpful, and everytime you look at him, you think "Man, if I could only! If I could only!" Well take that guy and multiply him times a billion. Still not there! I am proud of my super-nice, super-hot God.

[ Waves them harder. ]

And God picked America to be his favorite country on his favorite planet! How great is that!! And then he picked me to be born here, because he just likes me that darn much!

Sometimes, I stay up at night, just wondering what it would feel like if I had been born somewhere else, somewhere I couldn't be proud of. It'd be so sad, y'all! Every day, I'd dream of America. I'd dream of living in a place where I can be proud, every day and in every way, instead of whatever crappy country I lived in.

When I start to think like that, I thank God that he allowed me to be born in the country that I'm so proud of.

[ Waves them harder. Hopefully, the crowd is laughing, or at least looking at Steph funny. Steph talks to the flag.]

They're laughing/staring at us, babies. Shhh. Shhh. You hush. Don't you worry about them. You just wave for mama.

[ She waves them even harder, sings. ]

God bless America, God's favorite place! It's the coolest, and the very best, and I like living heeeere.

[ She wanders off. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

Hello everyone. Thank you for coming out to the show tonight.

COURTNEY
We are very excited to share some new sketches with you guys.

JOEL
So let’s go ahead and get started.

[ Curtis and Courtney snicker. ]

OK. Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I’d like to make an offer on your house.

[ Curtis and Courtney fail to contain their laughter. ]

My name is Joel.

[ Curtis and Courtney double over with laughter. ]

I’d really like you to hear my offer.

[ They laugh harder. ]

I think you’re going to want to hear my - all right! What’s so funny?!

COURTNEY
Oh come one, Joel.

JOEL
What?

CURTIS
Joel.

JOEL
What.

COURTNEY
You know.

JOEL
No.

CURTIS
It’s the reason we think you’re funny.

JOEL
What are you talking about?

[ Curtis and Courtney laugh again. ]

Seriously, what are you guys talking about?

CURTIS [ while laughing ]
Oh God, you’re killing me.

COURTNEY
Joel, it’s the only reason we let you stay in the group.

JOEL
What is?

CURTIS [ suddenly serious ]
Your voice, Joel.

COURTNEY [ imitates Joel’s “voice” ]
I’m Joel. I’m Joel. I’m Joel.

JOEL
I don’t sound like that.

CURTIS [ angry ]
That’s exactly what you sound like!

JOEL
I don’t sound like that.

COURTNEY [ angrier ]
Yes you do, Joel!

CURTIS [ still angry ]
Hear for yourself!

This is gonna be great.

[ The recording plays “Say something. Anything” and “I’m Joel,” in a funny voice. ]

JOEL
Screw you guys!

[ Joel runs, like a dandy, offstage. ]

CURTIS
I guess he runs funny too, or something.

COURTNEY
HE CAN’T HELP IT, Y’ALL!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ Some Star Wars music. Two JEDI are sitting at the feet of a JEDI MASTER. ]

JEDI MASTER
The galaxy is vast, young space knights. Vast and full of things. Robots and spaceships, for example. And then there’s lots of people. And aliens, who are like people, but different … well, don’t get me started. There’s a lot of them, too. Most don’t have names. Very few have a distinct, identifiable culture … But believe me, there’s a lot of them. And then there are all the various objects in the galaxy, like a table or some chairs or a gun that goes “zap.” Some objects may look familiar to us; some are so futuristic that it’s kind of hard to tell exactly what they are or what they’re for.

JEDI 1
You are wise, master.

JEDI 2
You are really wise, master.

JEDI MASTER
But underlying all of it is a single cosmic force, my pupils, a single force with two sides. There are two sides to everything. Light and darkness. Creation and destruction. Aliens and robots. Aliens and boobs. Boobs and wieners. Hamburgers and wieners. These two principles must be kept in balance. They are called Team Good Guy and Team Bad Guy.

JEDI 1
Which are we, master?

JEDI MASTER
Well, how chill do you feel right now? Do you feel pretty chill? Or are you all raged up?

JEDI 1
I guess I’m pretty chill. I’m sitting down. This robe’s comfortable.

JEDI 2
I’m trying to be chill, but I always feel like I’m a half-step away from being really upset about something.

JEDI MASTER
You, young pupil, are firmly on the side of Team Good Guy. Whereas you, other young pupil, may have difficulty resisting the lure of Team Bad Guy.

JEDI 1
How is balance found between the two teams, master?

JEDI MASTER
They oppose each other eternally. They go “pew pew” to each other. They go “zap zap” to each other. Team Bad Guy builds a giant space gun to attack Team Good Guy. But Team Good Guy blows up the space gun, baffling the evil will of Team Bad Guy. Do you understand?

JEDI 2
When do we learn magic spells, master?

JEDI MASTER
You must not call them magic spells, pupil.

JEDI 1
Are robots people, master?

JEDI MASTER
That’s not really my area.

JEDI 1
It seems like they have personalities, like people. In fact, their personalities are in excess of their function, sometimes even counterproductive to it--

JEDI MASTER
We’re getting a little--

JEDI 2
For example, I asked a robot to help me get a bag out of my spaceship. Not some random robot; it was the robot at the spaceship dock that’s supposed to help people with that type of thing. But it just bleeped at me and passed by.

JEDI 1
How rude.

JEDI 2
Exactly! Who programmed this guy to be rude instead of lifting bags?

JEDI 1
Honestly, very little about what we do or the world that we live in makes sense to me.

JEDI 2
A lot of it looks pretty cool.

JEDI 1
Granted. In a pastiche kind of way.

JEDI 2
Yeah, a combination of different design influences.

JEDI 1
Thrown together in a blender.

JEDI 2
But it doesn’t really hold together.

JEDI 1
Right. Sometimes, I feel kind of stupid for still living in this galaxy.

JEDI 2
Me too. I’m 32 years old. Isn’t this galaxy for kids, really?

JEDI 1
You can come back to visit when you have kids of your own.

JEDI 2
Sure, then it’s something you share with them.

JEDI 1
But live here? I don’t know, man.

JEDI MASTER
Silence!! Your agitating conversation has broken my chill, and now I am on Team Bad Guy!

JEDI 1
Whuh-uh!

JEDI 2
Pull out your zap sword!

[ They have a zap sword fight. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

THE ORIGIN OF SKETCHES



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ SOUND CUE. Cue includes voiceover in a Werner Herzog-ish tone, as well as music and ambient sound effects mixed in as appropriate. ]

V/O
When we speak of origins, we must turn our minds to where things started -- at the beginning. Only then can we truly understand this thing that is the opposite of an ending. Let us speak of the origins of tonight’s show.

[ During the preceding line, the neighbors lurch onstage, one by one. Primitive postures and attitudes. Joel is gnawing on a chicken bone. Courtney is arranging sticks in her hair. Curtis is reading Mad magazine and giggling dumbly. ]

V/O
Three performers. To gaze into their eyes is to gaze into our barbaric past, to drink of thick, chunky darkness, like a smoothie that has been poorly blended.

[ During the preceding line, the neighbors greet each other. Sniffing, grooming, rituals. Avoid obvious monkey stuff, which is too obvious! More squirrel-like. ]

V/O
The performers have woken from slumber. They have foreseen this. They have prepared for the winter, which is Sketchfest, which is actually in summer, which is now.

[ During the preceding line, they look for and then find a stockpile of sketches hidden away. (Maybe in an oversized acorn or other silly object.) Once they get the sketches, they scatter them on the ground, eat them, etc. ]

V/O
The sketches they stored so carefully have waited for them, little papers to give them sustenance and love, now prepared for the embrace of teeth, tongue, lips, and buttocks.

[ Courtney begins to craft clothing out of the torn sketches, weaving paper into her hair. Joel and Curtis try to mate with them, clumsily. ]

V/O
Wakefulness dawns. This is familiar to them. Ancient memories stir. The lore of a thousand generations of ancestors. This is the time.

[ They stop what they’re doing, acknowledge each other, gather in the middle of the stage as a tightly clumped group. ]

V/O
They will face it together. Music, in introduction.

[ The theme music plays. ]

V/O
Enthusiasm and goodwill.

{ The neighbors get excited, wave at the audience. “How you guys doing tonight??” “All right!” Clapping, etc. ]

V/O
An assertive and proud display, a statement of purpose.

ALL
We are Your Terrific Neighbors and we’re going to do some sketches about different things!

V/O
And then, darkness.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

V/O
For now, they must gather up their silly props. Scurrying in the black night, creatures guided by fear and hunger. Off to their props they go, off to array themselves for the first sketch, off they go, off, off, stalling stalling stalling … yes. Um. Well, here is a joke. The joke begins … well, there is a doctor. And, of course, there is a man who comes to see the doctor. And the man is ill. The man is suffering from an ailment. And the doctor asks him to describe … OK, they’re ready now.

LETHAL WARS



[ Spinning Variety newspaper: “George Lucas sells complete rights to Stars Wars franchise to Disney.” ]

[ Spinning Variety newspaper: “Disney, on IP rampage, purchases rights to Lethal Weapon film franchise.” ]

[ Spinning Variety newspaper: “Disney announces surprising strategy for future of Star Wars and Lethal Weapon franchises.” ]

[ The rest is done like a news report, cutting between different interviews. ]

DISNEY PR GUY
It’s absolutely clear to us that the future of both franchises lies in creating a consistent continuity where characters from both universes hang out and have adventures together. This is what the fans are clamoring for. This is what the fans are clamoring for? Sure, this is what the fans are clamoring for.

WRITER
The Lethal Wars universe gives us an opportunity to tell the kinds of stories we’ve always wanted to tell. Great characters, unlikely team-ups. Pairings that you just assumed would never happen, because the characters occupied two completely different worlds that have no relation whatsoever, even though secretly, if you are willing to look into your heart, you always deeply wanted the pairings to happen.

FAN
I wasn’t entirely sure that this was what I wanted, until they announced it. Now I realize that it just makes sense, and that’s it what I’ve always wanted to happen.

WRITER
Lt. Riggs and Princess Leia. Is there chemistry there? Does Han Solo get jealous? Does that turn into a whole thing? How do all of these characters cope with the situation? Does food help them to get through it? How does Lt. Riggs adjust to weird space food?

DISNEY PR GUY
We’re hoping to create a “trilogy of trilogies” for the Lethal Wars franchise. The overall story will involve our heroes going up against these evil robots who are selling space drugs. Seems like an impossible situation, but look out, our Star Wars heroes have some experience with evil robots, and our Lethal Weapon characters are used to fighting drug traffickers. Blasters plus pistols. Lightsabers plus … uh, knives, I guess. Jedis plus cops. It all adds up to more value for fans.

FAN
Sure, I’m gonna see these movies. What choice do I have? If I don’t see them, I’ll diiiiiiie.

WRITER
Lt. Murtaugh and Lando Calrissian. How do they both feel about being black guys in their respective lines of work? Is it different in space than it is on earth? For black people, I mean. Actually, never mind. I don’t think we want to get too far into this.

FAN 2
I love Star Wars. I saw Lethal Weapon. So yeah, I’m pretty excited.

FAN 3
This was all foretold. One day, all of the realms of dreams will come together into a single dreaming without borders. Boba Fett will be there. But Chris Rock’s character from Lethal Weapon 4 will also be there. What will they have to say to each other? Will they get along? Will they become bitter enemies?

WRITER
Rene Russo’s Detective Lorna Cole goes to the Mos Eisley cantina. Does she like the music? Probably. It actually isn’t all that different from earth-type music. She realizes that we’re not all that different, these aliens and me. It makes her laugh as she drinks a glass of weird blue stuff.

DISNEY PR GUY
Over the course of the three trilogies, we want to draw from other Disney properties to keep things fresh and exciting. You can bet Spiderman’s gonna be in this thing. And some of your favorite Disney fairy tale characters, in their live-action incarnations from our ABC television hit Once Upon a Time. Maybe some zoo animals from one of our parks. Hyperion Books, we own that, right? What’s on Hyperion? Mitch Albom? Maybe the characters go to heaven and meet the five people that you meet in heaven. You know, we’ll work in other stuff, too.

FAN 3
Other threads join the dreaming. The Farscape universe. The expanded M*A*S*H continuity, including After M*A*S*H and Trapper John, M.D. Joyce’s Dublin. The place where Beowulf happened. The movie goes on forever. We watch this movie in our heads forever. We need no food and no water. We all just watch the movie, and we are content.

FAN 2
I mean, what am I not going to see these movies?

FAN
I could go see some other movies, but there aren’t any.

FAN 2
Star Wars movies are the only movies.

FAN
Except, I guess, the Lethal Weapon movies.

FAN 2
Maybe I messed up my whole life.

FAN
Whatever, it’s gonna be awesome.

DISNEY PR GUY
There will also be a show on ABC.


STEPH IS TIDYING A KITCHEN AWAITING COMPANY
 
STEPH: OK. I've got the cookies, milk, comment cards, oh fuck my mouth I forgot pencils.
    STEPH PULLS OUT A LARGE HANDFUL OF PENCILS. THERE'S A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.  
 
STEPH: Come in!  

	JOEL AND CURTIS ENTER EXCITEDLY.  JOEL IS HOLDING A HEAD SHOT OF 'BALKY.'  CURTIS PULLS OUT A NOTEBOOK, OPENS IT AND BEGINS TO WRITE

CURTIS: Cookie Club meeting 20364 will begin on my mark.

	PAUSE
 
CURTIS: Mark. 
 
STEPH: Today's meeting will feature the tasting of an experimental recipe with mystery ingredients to be revealed...at a time....that is NOT....now.
 
JOEL: Cookie Club meeting 20364's agenda has been so named .  May we join you at your table, m'lady?

STEPH: Of course, sirs you are welcome.

CURTIS: We accept your welcoming. Now before we taste of your cookies let us join hands

    JOEL CURTIS AND STEPH HOLD HANDS

ALL: May the friendship we build be forever sweeter than the discs of perfection which brought us together.

JOEL: Let the tasting begin!

    JOEL AND CURTIS SIT AT A TABLE WHILE STEPH BRINGS OVER A TRAY OF COOKIES, COMMENT CARDS, AND PENCILS.  JOEL AND CURTIS EACH TAKE A COOKIE AND EXAMINE IT AS THEY MAKE NOTES. STEPH WAITS NERVOUSLY.

CURTIS: Impressive texture.  And the crumbability is surprisingly low.  The love and attention given to each cookie is more than obvious.
 
JOEL:  They smell good.

    JOEL IS ABOUT TO TAKE A BITE

STEPH: WAIT! Don't eat the cookie yet.
 
JOEL: Uh Steph.  I'm no meeting agenda coordinator, that's Curtis's job, but I think this is the appropriate time to eat the cookies.  Curtis?

CURTIS: Let me just check my notes to make sure.  One second.
 
    CURTIS PULLS OUT A LARGE NOTEBOOK, FLIPS IT OPEN, AND SCANS THE PAGES.
	 
	Declaration of meeting agenda.  Recognition of said agenda.  Request for invitation to the table.  Official request by host/hostess to visitors to join the table.  Acceptance of invitation. Joining of hands. Ah. Here we are. Next is the tasting of cookies.
 
STEPH: Don't quote procedure to me.  I've been a Cookie Club Cadet...
 
    AS SOON AS STEPH SAYS COOKIE CLUB CADET ALL THREE TOUCH FISTS AND SAY "MMM COOKIES."
 
 ...longer than any of you.
 
CURTIS: What's the problem?
 
STEPH: Poop.
 
JOEL: Poop?
 
CURTIS: Yeah, i think she said poop.
 
JOEL: Are you pooping too much or too little. Not at all?
 
CURTIS:  My Na-Naw has an incredible remedy for constipation.  You take three stray dogs...
 
STEPH:  My bowel movements are fine.  But, recently there has been a slight change with my poop itself.  All my life it's smelled like wet garbage and old.  Last Thursday, I took a shit that smelled like fresh raisin bread.  
 
CURTIS: Don't tell me...
 
STEPH:  I got a little curious.
 
JOEL:  Fresh bread you say?
 
STEPH: Raisin bread! It adds a kick to spaghetti sauce so I thought...      

 
    SHE GESTURES AT THE PLATTER OF COOKIES.  JOEL AND CURTIS LOOK AT THE PLATTER THEN AT EACH OTHER. CURTIS SPEWS HALF-MASTICATED COOKIE OUT OF HIS MOUTH AND THROWS DOWN HIS COOKIE IN DISGUST.  JOEL DOES THE SAME BUT IMMEDIATELY LICKS HIS FINGERS.

JOEL: Oh, God.

CURTIS: Joel! That's gross. 

JOEL:  It was a force of habit.
 
CURTIS: You have poisoned us, witch!

JOEL: I think I'm gonna puke.

CURTIS: Don't say that. Now I'm gonna puke.

STEPH: Oh my God, you guys, I'm gonna puke.

JOEL: No. Seriously.  I think I'm really going to puke.

CURTIS:  I just threw up in my mouth a little.  Oh, God I swallowed it.  Now it's in my nose.  Wait. those weren't half bad.

TITLE OF SKETCH (Lastname)

PRODUCTIVITY



[ LIGHTS UP on two office drones, sitting and typing facing forward at the edge of the stage.

The first one reaches a stopping point. She leaps out of her chair and begins doing some basic stretches. She goes on as the other one keeps typing. ]

ONE:
It's a productivity system. I work for thirty minutes straight, and then I stretch for thirty seconds to keep my body awake.

It's a proven fact that frequent short breaks maintain the mind's ability to focus. Our ancestors didn't evolve in offices, after all. They evolved on great, stretching plains. The Serengeti. They honed their instincts while hunting for tigers and the majestic water buffalo.

[ She reaches into a bag and pulls out a sweatband, which she puts on her head. ]

I'm really getting in the groove, I think.

Another thing that's important at work is minimizing distractions. Our digital age presents a lot of distractions. For example, e-mail. How many minutes a day do you suppose are wasted by people checking their inboxes? OK, take that number, and double it. Then triple it. Now it's a big number. You see? So I have one email alert that goes off three times a day. Anything I can respond to in less than one minute, I respond to it immediately. The others I flag for a more detailed response later in the day. So, for example, observe, like this: respond, flag, respond, flag, respond, respond, interesting, do I need it, no, delete, spam, spam, spam, interesting, but ... archive, to a labeled folder "email from mom," straight to my heart.

[ She gets out of the chair and goes into a downward-facing dog pose. ]

Blood rushes to the head, frees the mind, and you're ready for some more work, yoga-style.

[ She does a few more simple poses, breathes deep ostentatiously. ]

You can't think of it like office work, you know. You have to think of it as battle. Because that's what our bodies evolved for. Battle. We are physical creatures. We are warriors. As a woman, my body is calibrated for three things: battle, child-rearing, and organization. But you have to be the peaceful warrior. Stillness in motion. It's judo. It's leverage. You use the force of the work against itself.

[ She stands up, gets in a judo pose. ]

So the work comes at me, and I just --

[ Judo moves. ]

And then --

[ Judo moves. ]

So, suddenly, it's five a clock, and I'm not even tired. Because I just made the work do itself. With mind judo. People work too hard, you know? You have to value your weekends. You know how many people die from stress-related heart problems, all because of a little stupid work? It's ridiculous.

You know what else is ridiculous? Chicago-style pizza. I mean, I like it OK. I like eating it. But the idea that it's really some kind of style, that's ridiculous. It's some kind of bread bowl. It's not a concept for a pizza.

That was just some small talk. You can't talk about work all the time.

TWO
Janice, can you take it easy? I'm really trying to play Farmville. It's a game on the internet where I run an imaginary farm. I just got a pig. I need to build a fence for the pig.

[ Their eyes meet. Long pause. ]

TWO
Janice, it's all I have.

[ Long pause. ]

ONE
Maybe I'll take lunch.

[ She starts to leave. ]

ONE
If anyone needs me, I'm eating a cup o' noodles on the elliptical. [yelling back to him ] This is the best first day ever!

[ SHE EXITS. He looks at the monitor. ]

TWO
There you go, you little porker.

[ He sniffs sadly. LIGHTS OUT. ]

[TWO FRAT BOYS, rounding up four chairs.]

1: I know, I couldn’t believe it either.

2: Totally.

[THIRD frat boy enters.]

3: You ready to do this, bros?

2: Where’s fuckin’ T-Steaks?

[FOURTH calls from offstage.]

4: In the kitchen, dickmunch!

1: Are you munchin’ some dicks in there, T-Steaks?

4: Fuck off, Boojie!

2: T-Steaks saucin’ up some boners! Then he’s gonna eat those boners, dude!!

3: All right, retards, let’s go.

[The three sit down.]

3: OK. I hereby call this meeting of the Psi Epsilon Gamma book club to order.

4: Pound your boner on the table!

3: You’d love it, faggot!

4: You’re a fag!

[Pause.]

3: So, what did you guys think of Atonement?

[He pulls out his copy. Long pause.]

1: I thought it was gay.

2: [breaking in immediately] Oh, yeah, super gay.

3: [very quickly] I know, dudes!

2: I mean, I know we’ve read some pretty gay books this year, but this might be the gayest one yet.

1: Really? I thought The Corrections was pretty gay. I mean, like on a sentence-by-sentence level, really really super faggy and gay.

2: I’m not saying Atonement’s the gayest, dumbass, absolutely speaking. Its gayness just resonates the most for me on a personal level.

3: Well, look, no one’s going to argue that the book’s pretty gay.

1: Like, I’d say, it’s The Life of Pi-level gay.

2: But not Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night-Time gay, right?

[Pause. 1 and 3 break into laughter.]

3: Aw, dude, Squeaker.

2: What?! Fuck you!

1: You say the most fucked-up gay shit, dude.

2: You guys are pussies.

[3 springs forward and punches 2 in the groin. He curls up in a ball.]

2: You cockspawn!

3: You know you loved it, queer muffin.

[Pause.]

3: But seriously, we’re not making some Modern Library gayest books of the century list. I mean, cover-to-cover I thought it was boring as shit, but were there passages that stood out for you?

4: Hold the fuck on, choadtards!

[4 enters with a serving tray, four cups on it.]

3: Nice, T-Steaks.

4: Chamomile, fuckers.

[They all take a cup. 4 sits.]

1: What'd you put in this tea, homodrip?

4: Twist of lemon, spoonful of honey.

1: FAG! ... No, really, it's wonderful.

4: We doing favorite passages yet?
[1, 2, and 3 look at each other, as if to say “Oh, T-Steaks.” Laughter.]

4: Why don’t you plug your asshole mouth faces with some hard firm boners, you pusstards? Anyhow, there’s this one passage … [He pulls out a worn, heavily dogeared copy of Atonement, puts on some reading glasses.] I remember, when I first read it, I sat there for an hour, just letting it roll around in my mind. I underlined it three times, even copied it into my journal … a-ha. Here it is.

[4 recites a particularly “heavy” passage from Atonement. Pause. Everyone seems to mentally chew on the passage … enraptured by its poetry.]

1: Man … fuck The Corrections. In that one passage, Ian McEwan takes a dick straight down his throat and ends up with cum ... just all over his face.

3: It was so boring.

2: And totally, totally hungry for boners.

4: Yeah, a baker’s dozen of footlong Ron Jeremy cocks.

2: And hard, too.

4: Oh, absolutely they’re hard, absolutely.

3: It’s really gay. Really, really gay.

[Pause.]

3: And it makes you think that life is really pretty gay, too.

[Pause.]

1: OK, OK!! I can’t take it. I confess. I just rented the movie.

2, 3, 4: Booooooojiiiie!

[1 shrugs. Everyone laughs and freezes. Suddenly, 2 unfreezes and punches 1 in the nuts. He winces in pain, then freezes in his wince. Everyone laughs.]


GWYNEVERE
Howdy, I’m Gwynevere, marm and madam to ole Castle Gulch. When I moved to this god forsaken ditch of a town it was backwardser than a hastily put on tshirt...or just shirt...after a secret rendevous in the bathroom of a…...

Anyhow, I was sent here to bring a little culture to Castle Gulchians. Now who would give a whit whether the citzens of Castle Gulch were educated or none?

Well the elders of the mysterious island on which I was reared, a lady-centric counter-narrative that can only be seen when the mists are heavy on the moors, had read somethin of a prophecy in the stirrin leaves:

[Enter ELDER 1 and ELDER 2. GWYNEVERE appears to pray or meditate or whatever. The ELDERS join her on either side. Some ethereal music?]

ALL
Oh isle of ladies, mists of the fairer sex, we wend your magic and brush our hair. We sing the songs we learned at Girl Scout Camp:

Rose, rose rose, red,
Shall I ever see thee wed?
I will marry at thy will,
sire at thy will.

So say we all. Now for the exchanging of the friendship bracelets.

ELDER 1
Gwenyfarrrrrrrrrrr.

ELDER 2 [joining in]
Gwenyfarrrrrrrrr.

ELDER 1 [continuing]
arrrrrrrrr

ELDER 2 [continuing]
arrrrrrrr

[ELDER 1 ends the song like a conductor]

GWYNEVERE [sounding more sophisticated and normal than Castle Gulch Gwynevere]
Yes my wise elders.

ELDER 1
You have been with us since we found you as an infant half-drowned in a bog. We raised you in the image of the goddess, schooled you in the arts of femininity, wiliness and frilly things. We reared you for a mission, Gwynheefffffarrrrr.

ELDER 2 [joining]
Gwynefarrrrrrr

ELDER 1 [continuing]
Arrrrrrrrr

ELDER 2 [trying to harmonize.
Arrrrrrr. [beat] Your life’s work has come to pass, Gwnheyyefarrrr. [looks to ELDER 1 who shakes her head “no”] The prophecy we have seen is upon us.

ELDER 1
This is what we have prepared you for Gwynhefarrrrrr.

ELDER 2
Gwynhefarrrrrr.

ELDER 1
arrrrrrrr

ELDER 2
arrrrrrr

[The elders fade away while they say “arrrrrrr”]

GWYNEVERE [back to Castle Gulch accent}
They sent me from the magical feminist narrative in which I had been raised and schooled find the man in Castle Gulch was to go on to rule all of Avalon County. I was to culture, woo and bear bairn to the chosen one.

[GWYNEVERE opens a parisol and takes out a hanky and looks lost and disgusted. ARTHUR and MERLIN saunter slowly towards GWYNEVERE. MERLIN is eating a turkey leg. Sounds of an old west town?]

ARTHUR [to MERLIN but for GWYNEVERE to here]
Seems we got another ona them fancy types looks to teachin us manners and proper book useage.

[MERLIN throws the turkey leg on the ground, takes a book from his cloak, wipes his face with it and throws it over his shoulder]

MERLIN
T’aint never worked before t’aint gonna work this time.

[they reach GWYNEVERE]

ARTHUR
(something derisive steampunk something)

[GWYNEVERE turns around and ARTHUR is obviously love struck. ARTHUR removes his hat and worries at it with his hands]

ARTHUR
Beg pardon, miss, I’m Arthur, Sherrif and King a Castle Gulch here as well as its most notorious outlaw. This here’s Merlin, our local crotchety prospector and horse-man.

[MERLIN whinnies]

ARTHUR
How may we be of assistance to such a bewitching and sophisticated stranger in our little town?

GWYNEVERE
I’m here for work purposes, inquiring to all the towns in this area as to their needs in as far as educating their young.

ARTHUR
Well, ma’am, been over 20 years since our last school marm left. The marm challenged the local chaplain to a duel during a mighty heated poker game and he had no choice but to shoot her. After several years unoccupied the school house got blowt over in a terrible wind storm.

MERLIN
I remember that storm, it blew one of my metal patio chairs over.

GWYNEVERE
So you have no school house?

ARTHUR
Not in so much as havin a school house regular, ma’am, but we have other buildins school could be done in.

MERLIN
The Misses of Avalon aint been occupied for at least a decade, I reckon.

ARTHUR
Our brothel shut down after the madam fell ill to consumption during a heated poker game and the chaplain had no choice but to shoot her.

GWYNEVERE
You boys are in luck. I happen to be specially schooled in both the sex working and schooling arts.

MERLIN [pulling Arthur aside]
Sex working?! Arthur, I ain’t one to question your wisdom but this kinda high falutin downtown talk aint gonna go down well here with folk in Castle Gulch.

ARTHUR
You know I’m not one to superstition but I got a ticklin in my bones tells me this lady here has been sent by some higher power to culture, woo and bear bairn to me!

MERLIN
I looked inta the twigs of fortune just last night and didn’t see nothin bout this.

GWYNEVERE [back into her narrating accent]
So I set to schoolin and whorin in the towna Castle Gulch. Some days I was teachin chirruns their ABCs and 123s and some days I’m teachin a young man bout to go on a long cattle drive bout the birds and the bees. I’ve become a sorta part a the town now and have developed a confusing friend-type relationship with Arthur so I kinda fucked up there…But this is all great material for my one-woman show which I’m putting on at The Pendragon on May 6th at 8:30pm, May 7th at 10pm and a Matinee May 8th at…

[during this ARTHUR and MERLIN sit down as if at a campfire and MERLIN is throwing the twigs of fortune over and over again.]

MERLIN
Stop pimping your show, don’t no one care bout your journey ta’ find yaself.

[…...I don’t know now]

Part 1

[A bank. CUSTOMER and CLERK.]

CUSTOMER: I'll have some money please, Mr. Banker.

CLERK: Did you say "you have honeybees, now spank her"?

CUSTOMER: Why you?!?!

[Brandishes her purse.]

CLERK: I'm sorry ma'am, I'm very hard of hearing!

CUSTOMER: Hard of hearing you say?

CLERK: No, hard of hearing!!

[Laugh track.]

CLERK: Anyway, I thought maybe you'd want some money, so here it is.

[CUSTOMER takes cash, shakes her head, takes a few steps away.]

[ROBBER, played by Joel, enters: black stripey shirt, face mask, Coooookie Crisp-style. Has a gun.]

ROBBER: To the ground, naw-naw.

[Pushes her down.]

ROBBER: Now, you stay still, see, Mi-maw? All right, now, youse --

[To the clerk.]

ROBBER: This here's a stick-up, see? Now gimme the money, or you and gram-gram are gonna get it!

CLERK: No, I won't have a stick of gum, but thank you. And this bank's not for sale, so good luck renting it!

CUSTOMER: [Looks up at robber. Frowns, shakes head. Laugh track.]

ROBBER: NOW LISTEN UP!! GIMME ALL THE CASH YOU GOT, AND MAKE IT QUICK!

CLERK: Well, it just so happens I have a brick.

[Hits robber in skull with brick. Bell sound effect. Robber falls down.]

CLERK: I thought it was a strange request, but the customer's always right!

[Laugh track. Insane applause.]

CUSTOMER: Um ... don't you want to wake up and mistake me for your real grandmother now, Mr. Thief?

[Pause.]

CLERK: Just two minutes ... before I ... close the bank!

[Pause.]

So all transactions, including robberies, must be complete by then.

[Pause.]

Joel? Joel???

[A stagehand enters with a rubber brick in one hand, an opened box that says "PROP-CO" in the other.]

STAGEHAND: Guys? We finally got that rubber brick we ordered.

[Pause.]

[Someone runs by with a little Hot Wheels ambulance on a long black stick, shouting NEENEERNEENEERNEENEERNEENEERNEENEER. Set up is now Joel and DOCTOR. Joel's head is bandaged comedy-style.]

DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Osborne, I have good news and bad news. Which would you like to hear first?

JOEL: I'll hear the ... ... ... news.

DOCTOR: I'm sorry, I meant to -- uh. OK. I'll start with the good news. The good news is, you're alive.

JOEL: That's ... ... ... .

DOCTOR: Yes, ah. Well, the bad news is ... well ... Here's a map of your brain.

[Someone comes in with a "map of the brain."]

DOCTOR: Thank you Linda.

JOEL: OK.

DOCTOR: Now, you see the left side of your brain here? This one? This is where language is stored.

JOEL: Language.

DOCTOR: That's correct. And the various components of human speech reside in slightly different areas of the brain. Now, there's a small clump of neuro-linguistic pathways right here called the Exemplary Lobe. This particular part is where adjectives are stored. And I'm afraid yours was irreversibly damaged.

JOEL: Oh god. Oh Jesus. Oh no. This is the .... .... .... .... This is the day of ... [points at himself] life.

DOCTOR: I'm sorry, Mr. Osborne.

JOEL: How will I tell mother? This is going to make her feel ... ... ...

Part 2

JOEL: Since the injury, things have been ... ... ... Things have been for me. I've never felt ... ... ... There is none who is with me. I need to find a ... person.

[Someone appears in a chair. Joel sits down across.]

PERSON: So, is this your first experience with a dating service?

JOEL: This is ... ... time.

PERSON: It certainly is, Mr. Osborne. There's no time like the present to find love. Now, it says on your application here that you have some kind of handicap. I don't mean to pry, but for our purposes, it's important that we understand exactly what that is.

JOEL: I have a ... .... condition. I can't ... ... ... use ... words ... that --

PERSON: We'll, we can get to it later. Now, describe for us your perfect woman.

JOEL: She has ... a height. And a weight, too. And she has ... eyes. And ... hair. She has a ... face. And ... personality. Personality is ... I need to like ... personality.

PERSON: All right. Well, I guess we'll put you in the "not picky" file ... so you should be getting some calls from us pretty darn frequently! All right?

JOEL: ... ... ... ... Yes. [He slumps forward.]

Part 3

[A wedding. Bride goes up.]

BRIDE: OK, OK everyone. I know it's not really traditional for the bride to introduce her father before his toast -- shut up you guys! -- but I just feel like I had to say something, because a lot of you have never really met my dad, and those of you who have may feel like you don't really know him that well. You know, he isn't much of a talker.

[Laughter.]

BRIDE: Yeah. Bit of a strong, silent manly man, right? Haha. I know. That's the side that he wants the world to see. But, I just want to say that my daddy is the most inspirational man I have ever met. Seeing him face his everyday struggle with such bravery is what made me the woman I am today, what led me to another strong, inspirational man ... my dear husband Geoffrey. So, here he is -- my hero -- my daddy.

[Joel enters. He is old. His head is still fully bandaged.]

JOEL: That's daughter. I love ... daughter. I am at this place. Geoffrey is a ... man. I want you to be ... to have ... lives. And to .... remember ... the things.

[He lifts a glass. Bride weeps and hugs him.]

Drink!

Dance!

[Music begins.]

This is a song! Life!

 "Wormholes"
 Dad
 Mom
 Son



 [ FADE IN on DAD, with a newspaper under his arm, walking down a hallway. He approaches the bathroom.
 CUT TO interior bathroom. Dad opens the door. Weird, “spacey” sound effects. As he begins stepping in, he is hit by flying debris. Toilet paper is swirling around the bathroom. He shuts the door.
 CUT TO Dad in the hallway. A beat. He begins to open the door again.
 CUT TO interior bathroom. Dad opens the door. Debris is still flying around. The shower curtain flies into his face. He peels it off and shuts the door.
 CUT TO Dad in the hallway. ]
 Dad
 Honey!
 Mom
 [ offscreen ]
 Yes?
 Dad
 There's a wormhole in our bathroom.
 Mom
 What?
 Dad
 There's a wormhole in our bathroom!
 Mom
 No, I don't want any.
 Dad
 No, there's a wormhole in the bathroom. Why is there a wormhole in the bathroom?
 Mom
 It's not ours.
 Dad
 No, I said a wormhole.
 Mom
 I heard you. I said it's not ours.
 [ A beat. Dad thinks.
 CUT TO Son in his bedroom, playing video games. ]
 Son
 Pew pew pew! Pew pew pew! Boom!
 [ A knock at the door. ]
 Dad
 [ outside the door ]
 Scotty?
 Son
 What?
 Dad
 I need to talk to you for a minute.
 Son
 Dad, can we do it later?
 Dad
 No, we cannot do it later.
 [ Beat. ]
 You're not too old for a time-out, mister. That is fair warning. That is fair warning.
 [ Son sighs, gets up, lets his Dad into the room. Son continues playing video games while his dad sits on the corner of the bed. ]
 Dad
 How are you, son?
 Son
 Fine.
 Dad
 Are you?
 Son
 Yeah?
 [ Beat. ]
 Dad
 You're getting older. Becoming a man. There are certain changes you might be going through. Things that are confusing. And you can ask me about any of that.
 [ Beat. Dad snatches the game controller. ]
 All right, turn off the damn games for a minute and talk to me.
 Son
 Dad!
 Dad
 Son, do you rub yourself for pleasure?
 [ Beat. ]
 A lot of boys do. It's natural. I mean, the urge to do it is natural.
 Son
 No.
 Dad
 Be honest with me.
 Son
 No.
 Dad
 You can tell your dad anything.
 Son
 No! I said no.
 Dad
 Have you been touching your penis, son?
 Son
 Yes.
 Dad
 I thought so.
 [ Pause. ]
 It's a normal, healthy impulse for a boy of your age. It means you're growing up. It means that your body is eager to continue your genetic line by putting your seed into a fertile, receptive woman.
 [ Pause. ]
 But Scott, even though the temptation is perfectly normal, I can't have you ripping holes in the space-time continuum under my roof.
 Son
 What are you talking about?
 Dad
 Don't get cute with me, Scott. You're telling me you haven't noticed the wormhole in our bathroom?
 Son
 I don't know how that got there.
 Dad
 Son, when you abuse yourself like that, your body and your body is occupying the same space at the same time. That creates a paradox that tesserects space and time.
 [ Dad grabs a pen and a notebook of the desk. He starts sketching. CUT TO a shot of the notebook. ]
 You see, son, for most of human history, man has considered time to be a linear constant, always moving forward. In fact, it makes more sense to think of time in the same way as we think of spatial dimensions …
 [ DISSOVLE JUMP forward in time, as the page fills up with equations and sketches. ]
 … and that was where Einstein came in …
 [ DISSOVLE JUMP forward in time, as the page fills up with equations and sketches. ]
 … so, I'll bet you're wondering, “How do quantum mechanics complicate the model we've constructed?” …
 [ DISSOLVE JUMP forward in time. The page is now totally full of equations and sketches. ]
 … And before you know it, you've caused so much compression in the continuum that you reverse the Big Bang back in on itself, creating a singularity that obliterates all matter. So goodbye universe!
 [ CUT BACK to the former shot. ]
 And that's if you're lucky enough not to erase your own grandpa and create an alternate reality timeline beforehand. All because you needed five seconds of pleasure. It's not worth it, son.
 [ A beat. ]
 Son, there's a movie I want you to watch. I think it'll help you understand.
 [ He hands the son a DVD copy of Timecop. ]
 I think you'll find it quite entertaining, but I think you'll also find that it has a very positive message about space-time.
 [ Dad stands up. Son flips the DVD over to see that the movie has an R rating. ]
 Son
 Does this movie have any sex scenes in it?
 Dad
 [ absent-mindedly ]
 Now that you mention it, yes, I think it does.
 Son
 Is the chick hot?
 Dad
 [ abrupt ]
 Son, yes, the woman in the sex scenes is extremely attractive, but I don't see how that's at all relevant.
 [ Dad exits. Sons pops the DVD in, takes the remote, and begins fast fowarding. He unzips his pants.
 CUT TO Dad in the hallway. He pauses by the bathroom door. Smiles. ]
 Dad
 I'm a good father.
 [ He shakes his head, opens the bathroom door and walks casually inside as debris pelts his face. He closes the door. Loud sucking sound. The father howls, and his howl slowly vanishes.
 FADE TO BLACK. ]














 WORMHOLES

 THE OTTOMAN CLUB



[ LIGHTS UP ON A PAROLEE, A MAN, and an OLD LADY. They are all sitting in a circle. Each has an ottoman. (The parolee's is an orange crate.) A sign: "MEETING HERE AT 3:30 PM -- Nucksua County Ottoman Club. Come put your feet up!" The parolee stands. ]

PAROLEE:
First, let me say it's been a real pleasure. I know this is my first meeting, but I've really enjoyed coming here and "putting my feet up" with you good folks at the Ottoman Club. Jerry, your cookies were delicious. Margaret, I'm glad we got to chance to talk about your grandson. I think that you're right. I think that he should reconsider college.

[ Beat. ]

I've got a confession to make. It's a touch awkward perhaps, but you folks have been so welcoming, and I think I'd be remiss in not being fully honest with you. I was not excited about attending this meeting. You see folks, for many years I was on the wrong side of the law. Got myself into some bad situations with drugs and that led me to make some mistakes and throw part of my life away. I'm happy to say that I am clean now. I've paid my time and I'm ready to make a fresh start.

[ Applause. ]

Anyhow, my parole officer, he has some what you'd call progressive ideas about rehabilitation. He requires me to attend community functions, social gatherings, events where I might form new connections rather than being alienated from civil society. I was skeptical. I just chose this club randomly from a list of approved community events. Truthfully, I don't even own an ottoman of my own, which is why I brought the orange crate ... sort of a last-minute thing.

[ Beat. ]

I want you to know that I like what I see so far--really, just very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the subject, the history, the sense of community in this room. It's clear that you guys really love ottomans, and your enthusiasm is certainly infectious. You can definitely expect me at that next meeting.

[ Applause. Parolee sits. The man stands. ]

MAN:
Well, whatever path brought you here, Tony, we hope it keeps you with us, because the pleasure is all ours.

[ Applause. The man pulls out an index card. ]

I was wondering if anyone had extra ottomans in certain styles that they're looking to sell? I'm moving into a new place, and there are some pieces I'd like to accompany my new furniture.

[ Sighs. Puts cards away. Sighs. ]

Tony, you shared with us. Let me share with you.

[ Beat. ]

I had everything that men dream about. Beautiful wife. Amazing kids. Great job, great house. I couldn't enjoy it. Because it was all a lie, you see.

[ Beat. ]

From my teenage years on, I knew that I was a gay man, but I tried to hide it. I hid from my mom, the devout churchgoer ... my dad, mister macho army captain. I got so good at hiding it that I managed to hide it from myself, my wife, and my own children for the better part of twenty years. But then, six months ago, something snapped, and I couldn't live with the lie anymore.

[ Applause. ]

So I told her. I had to be honest with her. And she was so incredible about it. She said it always felt like there was something between us, and she was glad to finally know. And even though it ended our marriage, that marriage has turned into this unbelievable friendship. I've never felt closer to her than I do now.

[ Beat. ]

My kids just seemed relieved, like it was no big deal, and they wanted me to just get over it. Danny, my youngest, he teases me a little, of course, but I figure that's the least he can do.

[ Beat. ]

Until yesterday, the only people who still didn't know were my parents. I had no idea how they would take it, but they really surprised me. My dad was quiet for a moment, and then started saying he knew guys in the service who were "like that," and they could kill Charlie as well as anyone else, so they were okay by him. My mom asked a lot of questions -- some of them weren't exactly PC -- but she was just trying to understand in her own way.

[ Beat. ]

I've always liked ottomans. The feel of a good ottoman beneath my feet has always been a comfort. But until now, I've never known what it meant to really, truly put my feet up. Now I know. Now I know.

[ Applause. ]

So, anyhow, I am moving into a new place. And I will need to replace some of the ottomans that Sheila and the kids are keeping.

[ He passes the card to the old woman, who looks it over and passes it to the parolee. He shrugs. ]

Well, you know, if you hear anything....

[ He sits. A beat. The old lady stands up. ]

OLD LADY:
After a long struggle, Harold, my beloved husband of over fifty years, succumbed to death last Thursday.

[ Beat. Applause. ]

Naturally, I grieve for his loss. Harold and I shared everything during our many years together. The joy of watching our children grow, the disappointment of  learning that our lives would not always be what we had dreamed in our idealistic youth.

[ Beat. ]

There have been times of tragedy in my  life. When you live to be as old as me, you get used to being surrounded by death. In many ways, death becomes your most constant companion.

[ Applause. ]

But losing Harold is something quite different. It's like losing my foundation. Sometimes I worry that I'm going to crumble. And I don't want to crumble. I know I don't have much time before I follow him, and I know he wouldn't want me living that time like a broken woman.

[ Beat. ]

At a time like this, you need something solid under your feet. And I thank god that I have that, at least.

[ She pats her ottoman. Applause. She sits.

Pause. The parolee stands again. ]

PAROLEE:
Jerry, Margaret, It may sound crazy to say it, but I truly believe that the best people in the entire world are in this room right now, talking about ottomans.

OLD WOMAN:
Tony, it doesn't sound crazy.

MAN:
It doesn't sound crazy at all.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

The snob
Snob






[ THREE GUYS AND THE SNOB ARE IN A BAR, drinking beers and having a conversation. ]
guy 1
So did you catch it last night?
Guy 2
Oh, sure. Never miss it.
Guy 3
Every Tuesday evening.
Guy 2
It's funny stuff.
Guy 1
Yeah, I loved the part where –
snob
Past its prime, isn't it?
Guy 1
Excuse me?
Snob
That show. It's way past its prime. I mean, it had one solid season. And then …
[ He makes a “going downhill” gesture with his hand. ]
I mean, right? I'm not exactly breaking news here.
guy 1
Uh. I guess. I still think it's pretty funny.
[ Snob shrugs. Pause. A song starts playing on the jukebox. ]
guy 2
Aw, I haven't heard this one in a while.
Guy 3
What is this, like, early Flowers of Evil?
Snob
It's off Midnight Killers.
Guy 2
Yeah, that's right.
Guy 3
Their second album.
Guy 1
I love that album.
Snob
You love it?
Guy 1
Uh. Yeah, I love it. I mean, it's not my favorite, but I used to really love it.
Snob
You really love it?
[ Beat. ]
guy 1
Is there something so wrong with that?
Snob
I don't see it. I really just don't see it.
Guy 2
Well, you know, different strokes and so forth.
Snob
It's just that Flowers of Evil aren't that great to begin with. Sorry. They aren't. And then Midnight Killers isn't even their best album by a long shot. I don't even think their fans think that.
Guy 1
OK. Whatever.
Snob
It's kind of a … peculiar opinion, is all I'm saying.
Guy 1
Fine. I guess I'm some kind of freak.
Guy 3
OK, well, opinions differ.
Snob
Within reason, usually.
[ Pause. ]
guy 3
You know, I just finally got around to seeing Due Process II.
Guy 2
Finally, huh?
Guy 3
Well, I guess there was no big hurry. It wasn't as good as the first one, obviously.
Snob
To say the least.
[ Guy 1 eyes Snob defiantly. ]
guy 1
I liked it.
[ Beat. ]
snob
You liked it?
[ Beat. ]
guy 1
I liked it more than the first one.
[ Beat. ]
guy 2
Well, it did have a couple of really good scenes.
Guy 1
It had more than a couple of really good scenes. It had nothing but great scenes. Because it was a great movie. A great movie that I liked.
[ Beat. ]
snob
You're kidding around, right?
Guy 1
I'm not kidding around. I liked the movie Due Process II.
[ Beat. ]
guy 3
Well, I can see how –
snob
Are you fucking kidding me? You liked it? You really like it? How the fuck can you like it? How the fuck could anyone possibly like it?
Guy 2
Maybe we should just relax and have another round.
Snob
It just makes absolutely no sense that you could like that. You have got to be jerking me around, because it makes absolutely no sense that any reasonable human being could like that movie.
Guy 1
Well … I did.
[ Pause. Snob stands up, pulls out a futuristic gun, and shoots Guy 1 in the head. ]
guy 2
Jesus!
Guy 3
Oh my god!
Guy 2
You just fucking shot Gary!
[ Guy 2 gets down to tend to Guy 1. Turns him over. ]
snob
Gary, huh?
[ In death, Guy 1's face has become twisted and alien. Snob pulls some kind of futuristic communicator/computer out of his pocket. ]
Your friend “Gary” was a Thanaterenian. I've been tracking him for some time. They're shapeshifters. A merciless, militaristic race.
[ Beat. ]
And they have just, like, the shittiest fucking taste you've ever seen.
[ Snob presses a button on his belt, “beaming” him out of the bar, while the two guys gape.
We see the Snob's face against a background of space. Title card: “The Continuing Adventures of Insufferable Snob: SPACE HERO!” ]








“The Snob”

CURTIS
Welllllcome … to the “FIGHT DOME!” As you know, the year is 2012. April 12th! The future is here! It is today!

JOEL and COURTNEY [ together ]
We know what date it is!

CURTIS
Air is precious. Air is what we breathe. And as you all know, air is scarce.

JOEL
So scarce that we have been forced to the “underground” arena of the “Fight Dome.”

ALL
“FIGHT DOME”!!!!!

COURTNEY
As you know we are in Stage III air restrictions because there has been little to no “air fall” in the last two years.

CURTIS
And because of this, air “guitar” competitions, air “sex” competitions and air “quote” competitions must be held “underground”. We are all on the same page!

JOEL
I guess when I first mentioned being “underground” due to the scarcity of air I should have waited until the backstory of the air scarcity and banning of air competitions had been told.

COURTNEY
Yes, you “jumped” ahead.

CURTIS
Silence! You two are the final competitors in this competition to the “death”!

JOEL and COURTNEY [ together ]
We know this! We know this like we know the date! I wrote it on a check today! You wrote a check? Who writes checks these days? I had to pay the utility bill. Pay online. The Austin utilities website was down! Ah, that explains it.

CURTIS
You two have vanquished all other competitors, proving yourselves masters in the use of air quotes. But only one of you may be champion! Get ready to “fight”!

JOEL
I am ready.

COURTNEY
I too am ready, and even more so than “dickhead” here.

CURTIS
There will be time for "trash talk" in the air bar after the air quote competition is completed! I see no reason why we won't have plenty of time to playfully insult each other right after we crown a winner of the air quotes competition of which we are about to embark on. When we finish it will be maybe 9...9:15ish at the latest and then we can head down to the underground air bar we all know of and engage in jovial ribbing of one another.

JOEL and COURTNEY
We know this like we know the date. We know that we will go to the same air bar we always go to, that one you like so much but no one really likes that much, that one where you know the bartender so you think you get good deals on air drinks but he just makes them really weak. There's a new place down the street, have you heard of it, maybe we should try it, they serve only air from the Chihuahua desert and it made like a Texas Monthly top ten list or something....

CURTIS
Enough! We will start the competition now! Should the competition become too intense, each of you has an emergency "air supply" under your seat. Use this only in an emergency! First we will start with standard "meat and potatoes" air quotes. These are the quotes of the "everyman", "blue collar" quotes, if you will. "The Sarcastic".

JOEL
Wow, that thrift store dress really "flatters" your figure. It's so ill-fitting yet really "shows off" your curves.

COURTNEY
Wow, that unkempt facial hair makes you look so "cool" and "with it".

CURTIS
You!

[ CURTIS points to JOEL who fist pumps. ]

CURTIS
"The Euphemism"

JOEL
Wow, you look like you got smacked in the face with an "old tiger's tail".

COURTNEY
Wow, I'm pretty sure if you fell into a pile of pudding you'd still come up "eating your own pie hole".

CURTIS
You!

[ CURTIS points to COURTNEY who fist pumps. ]

CURTIS
"The Ironic".

JOEL
Wow, your face is like "10,000 spoons" when all you need is a "knife".

COURTNEY
Wow, your face is like "meeting the man of my dreams" and then meeting his "beautiful wife".

CURTIS
You!

[ CURTIS points to COURTNEY who fist pumps. ]

CURTIS
"The Unnecessary"

JOEL
Wow, you are really "ugly".

COURTNEY
Wow, you are so "stupid".

CURTIS
You!

[ CURTIS points to JOEL who fist pumps. ]

CURTIS
The competitors are tied so it is now time for the "lightning round"! I will shout out air quotes categories and the competitors will "quick draw" their air quotes, "showdown" style. On the count of three...."one"..."two"..."three"..."The After School Special"

[ AIR RAID SOUND EFFECT plays. ]

Air levels have become dangerously low! Activate the air supply!

[ ALL OUT OF LOVE by Air Supply plays. Different AIR RAID SOUND EFFECT plays. ]

CURTIS
Ladies and gentlemen! We are being raided! That's right! This is an "air raid"! When the authorities descend upon us, we must pretend like we have been watching a boring, educational variety show and not a highly entertaining, highly illegal, very intense "air quotes" competition! Everyone ready?!

[ Clears throat. SLIDE 1 appears. ]

And what most people don’t know is President Nixon was an avid air quoter.

[ SLIDE 2 appears. ]

In conclusion, this was the last man ever to perform the "air quotes" gesture.....

[ MACHINE GUN FIRE. ]

[ CURTIS falls down dead. JOEL and COURTNEY run, MIKE and RALPH outro us. ]


WEIRD NURSE



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A doctor is performing surgery downstage. ]

DOCTOR
Nurse. Suture.

[ A nurse ENTERS through the door. She is carrying a tote bag full of random objects. ]

DOCTOR
Oh, god help me, it’s that weird nurse.

NURSE
Suture.

[ The nurse comes up to the doctor, hands him a random object which he tosses aside immediately. ]

Hello, doctor.

DOCTOR
Hello, weird nurse.

NURSE
Why does everyone call me that?

[ He doesn’t respond. ]

Clamp.

[ She hands him a random object. He throws it away. ]

DOCTOR
I didn’t ask for a clamp.

NURSE
But you were about to.

DOCTOR
But that wasn’t a clamp.

NURSE
But you didn’t ask for one.

DOCTOR [ to audience ]
This nurse is so weird!

NURSE
Doctor.

DOCTOR
Nurse?

NURSE
I’ve been thinking about something.

DOCTOR
Yes?

NURSE
Us.

DOCTOR
Right now is hardly the time, nurse...

NURSE
I’ve been thinking about the chemistry between us.

DOCTOR
There is no chemistry between us, nurse.

NURSE
Exactly. That’s the problem.

DOCTOR
Scalpel.

[ Nurse hands him a random object, which he discards. ]

NURSE How can we have a romantic relationship with this obvious lack of chemistry between us?

DOCTOR
We don’t have a romantic relationship.

NURSE
Not yet.

DOCTOR [ to audience ]
What did I tell you? This nurse is really weird!

NURSE
Here’s a piece of bread.

[ She hands him a piece of bread, first taking a bite. He discards it. ]

Lunch is very important, Doctor.

DOCTOR
Not now, nurse.

NURSE
It’s the most important meal of the day, according to medicine.

DOCTOR
It isn’t.

NURSE
We ought to have lunch together someday.

DOCTOR
No.

NURSE
Too high stakes?

DOCTOR
No.

NURSE
We’ll start with breakfast.

DOCTOR
No!

NURSE
Medicine.

[ She hands him another random object. He hands it back to her. She hands it back to him. He returns it again. She returns it. ]

DOCTOR [ to audience ]
Weird! Just plain weird!

NURSE
Surgery.

[ She hands him a random object. ]

DOCTOR
What’s this?

NURSE
It’s a pinafore.

DOCTOR
It’s not a pinafore.

NURSE
No, what’s a pinafore?

DOCTOR
What?

NURSE
What’s a pinafore?

DOCTOR
What’s a pinafore?

NURSE
Holds two pieces of cloth together.

DOCTOR
This isn’t a pinafore.

NURSE
What’s a pinafore?

DOCTOR
Weird nurse, stop this this instant!

NURSE
I’m sorry?

DOCTOR
Weird nurse, this patient is in critical condition. His life is hanging by a thread. This is no time for your “weird” antics. Frankly, I can’t understand why we continue to employ you at this hospital. You are not a good nurse. You are a bad nurse, and you are a weird nurse. The things that you do cause patients to die. Our decision to keep you on staff goes beyond malpractice. It is a crime. It is monstrous.

[ Pause. ]

NURSE
Listen to me, doctor. Perhaps you’ve spent so long staring into open chest cavities that you can’t see the world around you. I provide a valuable service to this hospital. I generate a spirit of free-wheeling adventure that leads to innovation and creativity. Also, my spirited antics create laughter and humor, which are the best medicines according to movies and TV. Furthermore, my father was abusive. Here’s a see-and-say.

[ She hands him a see-and-say. ]

DOCTOR
Weird nurse, I can’t stay mad at you.

NURSE
Doctor, the patient.

DOCTOR
Oh, he’s dead. Totally dead.

NURSE
It’s a miracle, doctor!

[ She embraces him. The patient rises from the table. ]

PATIENT [ to audience ]
Geez Louise, what a weird nurse!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ Courtney and Curtis sit in two chairs next to each other. ]

ADAM
Now, a special treat: Curtis and Courtney will be taking your questions from the internet!

CURTIS
Hi, guys.

COURTNEY
We’re excited to have a direct conversation with the fans.

CURTIS
Just share your video questions on Instagram or Vine with the hashtag “ask C & C”.

COURTNEY
That’s an ampersand.

ADAM
All right, here come some questions.

[ Each question is a video, which Adam displays on an iPad. Maybe we use that Bluetooth speaker to make sure each question is loud enough. ]

ADAM
Let’s start slow.

Q
Hey guys. What are your favorite colors?

CURTIS
Blue.

COURTNEY
Blue-ish yellow.

CURTIS
Green?

COURTNEY
That’s the one.



Q
Hey Curtis and Courtney. I’m a big fan, and I was just wondering: What are some of your favorite movies?

COURTNEY
There’s so many.

CURTIS
There’s so many movies.

COURTNEY
I like so many.

CURTIS
I can’t pick just one.

COURTNEY
I’d hate to pick just one.

CURTIS
I’ve seen at least twenty movies, and they were all good.

COURTNEY
I like the excerpts from Scarface that they use on rap albums.

CURTIS You’ve Got Mail.

COURTNEY
Yeah, You’ve Got Mail.

Q
Courtney, where do you shop for those cool clothes?

COURTNEY
Everything I wear is from Knuckle and Sparrow. They're a local shop. Local vintage. They know me. Very cool, very local. The owner and I have a relationship that I'm not even comfortable talking about. They have the best female slacks. I've spent so much time there that the owner and I joked about me moving into the dressing room. We tried it. It didn't work out. It was too soon. You have to be sure before you do it. Things got weird. No one liked it. Now I'm not welcome there and I can't get any clothes.


CURTIS
Sometimes when I see what Courtney's wearing for the show, I'm like, "What? Why?" But then I'm like, "OK."

Q
Curtis, how do you balance personal life with your career?

CURTIS
I keep a list with two columns. One is "life" and the other is "career." I carry it all day and keep track of things. Kiss my wife: life. Went for a walk and thought about stuff: life. Spent time jamming on an Excel spreadsheet: career. Ate breakfast: that's tricky, because food is fuel for both my lives. So I alternate it every day. Same deal when I go to the grocery store for salmon but also some wig glue. A the end of the year I send the list to my accountant to make sure I get tax refunds.

COURTNEY
Curtis is my long-time creative partner, and we have a good relationship.

CURTIS
That's right.

Q
What gets you really excited?

CURTIS
I like ... corn, to eat. Or a picture of someone wearing a perfect hat.

COURTNEY
There's a song I heard. I don't know the title.

Q
When you're about to do a show, what do you do to get ready?

COURTNEY
I like to think about the show and what's happening in the show.

CURTIS
Breathing ... is important.

Q
You guys have performed together for a long time. What are each other's funniest qualities?


CURTIS
Courtney has this one really silly bag. I don't know. It just makes me smile when she carries it.

COURTNEY
I got rid of that bag.

CURTIS
I know.

COURTNEY
Curtis does this thing with his face.

[ Curtis reacts. ]

COURTNEY
There! ... Maybe it's not that good.

Q
What are some of your biggest inspirations?

COURTNEY
Dogs. My dog, but also all dogs.

CURTIS
Woody Allen. No, not Woody Allen. Jesus. Why would I say that? OJ Simpson. No. Hitler. In this order: Hitler, then OJ, then Woody Allen. But, I stress, NOT for his movies. For the creepy stuff that he did.

[ COURTNEY sighs loudly, pulls out an issue of a guns and ammo magazine. ]

Q
What do you think is the most attractive part of the body?

CURTIS
For a woman? Uh, the top part. Hair.

COURTNEY
The lookers. The part you see out of. Agh.

Q Hey guys, could we all sigh loudly together?

[ They do. ]
Q
Thanks, guys.

CURTIS & COURTNEY
You’re welcome.

[ They react, annoyed, to each other. ]

[ Now, Curtis and Courtney start showing up as the questioners. ]

CURTIS Q
Hi, this is Bertus from the internet. Question for Courtney: What’s with your attitude lately? Who shit in your corn flakes?

COURTNEY
No one shit in my corn flakes. I don’t eat corn flakes. No one shit in any of my food. Why do people think my mood is dependent on whether or not someone shit in my food? It’s stupid.

CURTIS
It’s a figure of speech.

COURTNEY
You’re a figure of speech.

COURTNEY Q
Hi this is … also Bertus, from the internet. Two-part question for Curtis: When exactly did you turn into a grade-A asshole? And do you intend to stop at any point, or is this just “your thing” from now on?

CURTIS
OK, look, it’s time to clear the air, because I know that rumors are flying about our relationship. It’s true: We don’t like each other.

COURTNEY
We’re a great team that doesn’t like each other. Like Mick Jagger and Keith Richards from the 70s on. Or Debra Winger and Richard Gere behind the scenes of An Officer and A Gentleman.

CURTIS
I heard about that.

COURTNEY
Curtis heard about it. I guess it must be real, then.

[ Courtney sighs. ]

COURTNEY Q
Sometimes, I want to murder him so hard.

COURTNEY
I hear you.

CURTIS Q
Maybe it’s time to put the murder plot in place.

CURTIS Tonight’s the night.

COURTNEY Q
Grab him by his dumb beard and wipe that smile off his face.

COURTNEY
OK.

CURTIS Q
She doesn’t even have a beard. What’s her problem?

CURTIS
OK … That’s kind of a stretch.

COURTNEY Q
Crush his bones to make your bread.

COURTNEY
I don’t want to be a giant!

CURTIS Q
Strap her to a rocket and shoot her into the sun.

CURTIS
That’s not practical. At all.

COURTNEY Q
Listen to me!


COURTNEY
I’m listening!

CURTIS Q
This is your brain talking, dum dum!

CURTIS
I’m not a dum dum! I’m a grown man who buys his own shirts!

CURTIS and COURTNEY Q
You’re really pushing it, buster!

CURTIS and COURTNEY
Shut up!

[ The iPad screen goes blank. ]

ADAM [ checking the pad ]
Hmmm. Too many questions, I guess. The internet has to reboot, guys.

[ Curtis and Courtney sigh. Adam sighs. Curtis and Courtney sigh. ]


KING FIGHTS



[ A dude and a lady sitting on the couch. ]

DUDE
Whatcha wanna watch?

LADY
I dunno. Breaking Bad?

DUDE
We’re caught up.

LADY
Shit. Mad Men?

DUDE
Same deal.

LADY
Ugh. I dunno, then. We could watch something new.

DUDE
What about King Fights? You might be into it.

LADY
Eh. I don’t really like fantasy stuff.

DUDE
This isn’t like other fantasy stuff, though. It’s gritty, you know. It’s realistic.

LADY
Realistic?

DUDE
Yeah, you know, the characters and plots are a little more realistic and historical. There’s not, like, elves and shit. It’s this big complicated world with different cultures and politics and stuff.

LADY
Cultures and politics. Wow.

DUDE [ grabs remote ]
Give it a try. I think you might like it.

LADY
All right, whatever.

[ We switch to the show. Maybe we can do a pseudo-GOT opening sequence using a board game or something. ]

[ Scene. A modern living room. A king sits on a chair, eating Arby’s. An advisor enters. ]

ADVISOR
Your majesty, you have not left your inner sanctum in weeks. Unrest grows in the kingdom. Your people need their king.

KING
Leave me alone! I feel baaaad!

ADVISOR
Your majesty, I--

KING
Seize him!

[ A knight grabs the advisor from behind. ]

ADVISOR
Your majesty! I--no!

[ The knight stabs him in the throat. King scoops fries into his mouth. ]

[ Scene. A council of generals gathered over a map. ]

GENERAL 1
Lord Dingdong’s forces are marshalling in the east.

GENERAL 2
They are no threat to us.

GENERAL 1
Lord Dingdong has over 50,000 horsemen with flameswords. Lord Dingdong commands a fleet of old seabreakers. Their holds are full of strikerbeasts, which are Lord Dingdong’s to command alone. And he has forged an alliance with the deathmen of the the great plateau.

GENERAL 3
His cause is not just!

GENERAL 2
Lord Dingdong is no threat. Our forces have the advantage.

[ Gesturing on map. ]

GENERAL 2
His forces are divided from us by the Mountain of the Easy Passage. Their only choice is to take the high road, or attempt to pass through the Mines of Safety and Good Fortune. Then they must cross the shallow Stream of the Open Gate. Then they must march through the Forest of Happy Dreams and Well-Lighted Places. Finally, they must cross--every man and beast among them--through the Desert That’s Not Really That Bad.

GENERAL 3
And his cause is not just!

GENERAL 1
You’re right. I’m feeling very good about this.

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, at Castle Gulch.” Two knights stand in a dusty road. ]

GULCH KNIGHT
Now, you look-a here, sir knight. We don’t cotton to your type of chivalry here in Castle Gulch. If you got half a notion to see the sunrise, you best catch the first horse and carriage out-a-this-a-here corner of the realm.

GULCH KNIGHT 2
I ain’t-a figure I’m gointa.

GULCH KNIGHT
Well, then, we have us a little contest of honor a-brewin’ betwixt us then, I reckon.

GULCH KNIGHT 2
You reckon right, sir knight.

[ Gulch knights both spit on the ground, squint at each other. ]

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, in the Frozen Wastes of Coldia.” Shitty green screen of a arctic polar bear. A barbarian enters. ]

BARBARIAN
I vow to kill the great bear that slaughtered my brother.

[ A wizard enters. ]

WIZARD
That great bear contains the spirit of your dead wife.

BARBARIAN
But why would my dead wife wish ill on my dear brother?

[ Wizard makes the finger-in-hole “fucking” gesture. ]

BARBARIAN
No!!

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, in Horse Duchy.” ]

[ Clips of horses. ]

HORSE SUBTITLE 1
We will have vengeance on the man things! I want hay!

HORSE SUBTITLE 2
I will be the king of all kings! Neigh-h-h-h!

HORSE SUBTITLE 3
I’m a lady and that’s hard no matter what species you are. Look at my tail!

HORSE SUBTITLE 4
I stamp my pretty legs so gracefully.

HORSE SUBTITLE 5
Oats!

[ Scene “Meanwhile, in Bathing Suit Land.” ]

[ Two dudes are wearing bathing suits, having a sword fight. One wears a shirt. ]

[ Two ladies, sitting side by side, in bathing suits and sunglasses. ]

LADY 1
Sir Anton duels in a shirt because he is insecure of his body.

LADY 2
But a fierce fighter!

[ Blood sprays across them. They are not bothered. They applaud. ]

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, at the great capitol.” ]

[ The king sits on his “throne.” ]

KING
Blaaaah! Blaaaah!

ADVISOR
You majesty, Lord Dingdong’s rebellion that we mentioned earlier gains in strength. The forestlivers of the north have joined his insurrection. They have this one scary and dangerous thing they can do that no one else understands.

KING
Don’t care!

ADVISOR
You’re being such a jerk!

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, in the land of a totally separate plot.” ]

[ Two dudes in a car, singing along to Foghat’s “Slow Ride”. ]

[ Scene. “Meanwhile in the land where babies are currency.” ]

[ Two merchants. ]

MERCHANT 1
We’re the worst people, right?

MERCHANT 2
Oh man, absolutely. No one is worse than us.

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, at Castle Gulch.” Two knights stand in a dusty road. ]

[ Two knights continue to squint off, as in a Leone movie. ]

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, in the country where everyone rollerblades.” Clips from an episode of Star Trek. ]

LADY ON SKATES
This is the country where everyone rollerblaaaaaaades...

PEASANT
Sweet wheels, your grace!

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, in the land where Star Trek.” Clips from an episode of Star Trek. ]

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, back in the land of a totally separate plot.” ]

[ Two dudes in a car, looking forward and screaming. Then look at each, scream. Look forward, scream. ]

[ Scene. “Meanwhile, in the Realm of Everything Happening at Once.” ]

[ Sound and video from all the previous stuff overlaid on each other, with other clips cut in randomly as well. ]

[Scene. Meanwhile, in the Land Where People Wear A Lot of Leather Belts.” “He marches North with a thousand-score Beltanders.”]


FARM FRESH ORANGES

[ A VENDOR. He has a small crate of oranges. A sign: “Farm Fresh Oranges for Sale”. The vendor is setting up a second sign, which shows an arrow pointing to the vendor: “Want to buy an orange to eat? Talk to this man.” He is wearing pajama pants, flip flops, and a Mr. & Mrs. Smith shirt. He reaches over to the oranges, hesitates.  ]

VENDOR
Today’s the big day, guys. Today’s the day. Hope your bags are packed ‘cause today you’re going to a new home.

[ He sits. ]

VENDOR [ yelling ]
Farm fresh oranges!! Get your farm fresh oranges! If you like farm fresh oranges, I got ‘em! Get them from me! Buy some farm fresh oranges!

[ A WOMAN ENTERS. ]

VENDOR
Farm fre--

[ The vendor stops in mid-sentence, tries to look inconspicuous. ]

WOMAN
Selling oranges?

VENDOR
Yes -- no -- maybe -- whatever -- why? -- what do you want?

[ He tries to fold the sign over hurriedly. ]

WOMAN
I’d like to buy an orange or two.

VENDOR
Okay, so what do I care?

WOMAN
It says that you’re selling oranges.

VENDOR
No.

WOMAN
The sign.

[ She points at it. ]

VENDOR
It’s an old sign. So, like, if you like reading old signs, read it again, what do I care?

WOMAN
OK, well, fuck you.

VENDOR
No!

[ She starts to leave. ]

VENDOR
Ma’am, ma’am. Just kidding. It’s a joke. I’m selling oranges.

[ The woman looks at him, narrow-eyed. ]

VENDOR
It’s a joke I have with my friends.

[ He starts laughing. She starts laughing. ]

WOMAN
So how much are the oranges?

[ He stops. He gestures for her to come over. She leans in, bends her ear. ]

VENDOR
I’m not selling oranges!! 
WOMAN
Fuck you!

[ She punches him in the chest. Vendor is alarmed. ]

VENDOR
Wait wait. Reboot. Let’s reboot. Let’s start this over. Look. I’m selling oranges. It’s true. But these oranges are really special to me. They’re fresh from the farm. Not just anybody deserves these oranges, OK? OK?

[ She looks at him skeptically. ]

WOMAN
These are good oranges?

VENDOR
These are the best oranges I’ve ever tasted, and seriously, I’m not saying that becuase I grew them on my orange farm. I’m not saying that because I plucked them off my orange bush with my own two hands.

WOMAN
Oranges grow on bushes?

VENDOR
They grow on ... a plant. It’s immaterial. The point is, when I first tasted one of these oranges, I felt like my taste buds had called me up for an all-night hardcore fuckfest in my mouth. Pardon my French. I tried to kill myself.

WOMAN
Why?

VENDOR
Because what’s the point? Look at me. I never dress like this. Never. But now, after this orange, what’s the point?

WOMAN
How much are they?

VENDOR
Three for two ... I mean, one hundred dollars apiece.

WOMAN
That’s insane. There’s a guy a mile down who sells them for four bucks a pound.

VENDOR
That’s a fair price for an orange that’s got crap in it.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
He craps in his oranges.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
He craps in his oranges.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
I’ve reported it several times.

WOMAN
He does not crap in his oranges.

VENDOR
He might as well.

WOMAN
What does that mean?

VENDOR
His oranges taste like crap. Like a big crap.

WOMAN
OK. Well, look, it’s been a few minutes already, and it kind of feels like a lot longer than that--

VENDOR
Time flies when you’re having fun.

WOMAN
Right, that’s the opposite. So let’s just get this clear: Is there any way on earth I’ll be leaving this interaction with some oranges?

[ Pause. ]

VENDOR
Probably not.

WOMAN
OK, well. I wish I could say this has been fun. Good luck to you, I guess?

VENDOR
Thanks, I really don’t make it that far with most people.

[ She leaves. He sits. ]

VENDOR
Good luck ... to me!

[ He looks at his oranges. ]

VENDOR
It’s gonna happen today, fellas. We’re really gonna make it happen.

[ He calls out again. ]

VENDOR
Oranges! Oranges fresh from a farm! Naranjas frescas!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

CIGARS



[ LIGHTS UP ON TODD AND ED. ]

TODD:
Ed?

ED:
Yes, Todd.

TODD:
Something's missing.

ED:
Something's missing?

TODD:
Lately, I've felt like something's missing.

ED:
Did you retrace your steps?

TODD:
Something's missing from our lives. I'm twenty-seven years old.

ED:
As am I.

TODD:
We're adults.

ED:
By any measure.

TODD:
But I don't feel like an adult. I feel like a child.

ED:
Because something's missing.

TODD:
Precisely.

[ Beat. ]

ED:
Kids?

TODD:
God, no.

ED:
Marriage?

TODD:
Jesus Christ, no. I'm not ready for that.

ED:
Taking your job seriously?

TODD:
My nine to five doesn't define me.

ED:
A clean house?

TODD:
I told you I'd get around to it this weekend.

[ Beat. ]

ED:
You've stumped me. What's missing?

TODD:
Cigars.

ED:
Cigars?

TODD:
It's time for us to get into cigars.

ED:
That's it?

TODD:
"That's it"?

[ Todd pulls a cigar from his pocket, removes the wrapping, puts it in his mouth. ]

Old-fashioned sophistication. Masculine grace. A powerful smell. Yes, Ed, "that's it."

[ He tries to bite off the end of the cigar and spit it out. He bites off a little too much, ends up with flakes of tobacco on his tongue. ]

ED:
You don't smoke.

TODD:
I don't smoke. I smoke cigars.

ED:
Same thing?

TODD:
It is not. Cigarettes are for teenagers in baggy jeans and fat old sallow women tugging at Atlantic City slot machines. Cigars are for men. Men of wit and position. Rich, robust, oaky men.

[ Todd holds up a series of pictures of the following men. ]

Men like Mark Twain! Sigmund Freud! Mr. Spacely from The Jetsons!

ED:
Kid Rock.

TODD:
I'm sure I don't know who you're talking about.

[ Todd pulls out a lighter and lights the cigar. He takes a puff. ]

Watch that smoke curl, Ed. It's a diaphanous road to a vanished world of men.

[ Another puff. ]

A world where corpulent power brokers bathe in coal-heated wooden barrels. Where weighty affairs of state are settled over a hand-drawn map and two glasses of brandy. Where the sexual health of even the fanciest prostitute cannot be guaranteed.

[ Another puff. ]

Memories of empire!

ED:
Where did you get it?

TODD:
Behind the counter at the gas station.

ED:
Shell?

TODD:
Valero.

[ Pause. ]

It's pretty good.

ED:
How do you know?

TODD:
It cost four dollars. The other ones cost two or less.

[ He looks at the cigar. ]

How much longer do you think it'll last? One minute? Two?

ED:
You've got twenty minutes at least.

TODD:
Time enough to be a man.

[ He takes a another puff. ]

Let me just put this down for a moment.

[ He puts it down. ]

Needn't hurry the pleasure, after all. A man does not gulp from life's cup. He sips.

ED:
Todd.

TODD:
Edward?

ED:
Can I put out your cigar and throw it away?

[ Todd looks tempted. ]

TODD:
No ... no, you can't.

ED:
It smells like a burning vat of pubic sweat.

TODD:
As a man with a cigar, and therefore authority, I order you not to extinguish my cigar, the source of my authority.

ED:
All right.

[ Todd grabs the cigar. ]

TODD:
Cigar!

[ He holds it aloft. ]

While I was at Valero, I also picked this up.

[ He pulls out an issue of GQ Magazine. ]

Gentleman's Quarterly. Not some weekly rag. Though I be not of the gentry, the clerk must have spied that within mine eyes and gait which bespoke of some nobility, and thus allowed me purchase of this journal.

[ He opens it up. ]

Herein is the very chart of the fashionable man about town, a man who catches your eye and steals your focus, a man with ... a cigar!

[ Ed takes the magazine, flips to some articles. ]

ED:
Gentlemen seem to love ultimate fighting.

TODD:
A gentleman is sporting.

ED:
And body spray.

TODD:
Yet he is not afraid to put on the teasing airs of a dandy!

[ Todd takes another puff of the cigar, looks a little ill. ]

ED:
Doesn't that thing taste like crap?

TODD:
Nay! No more than life itself.

ED:
Put it out.

TODD:
Never.

ED:
Just put it out. I know where this is going, and I don't want you hosting weekly poker nights and puking scotch into the bathtub.

TODD:
I shall do all these things and more! I have been a boy too long! In Africa, they hunt lions with spears. The natives of this land wrestle with bears to prove their mettle. This is my rite de passage. This is my walkabout! I will smoke this cigar, and then I will smoke another! And then I will stand with broad shoulders and stride this earth as a man.

[ Ed grabs the cigar, snuffs it, and tears it in two. Then he slaps Todd.

Pause.

Todd picks up the GQ and starts flipping through its pages. ]

TODD:
How much do you think it would cost to get into motocross?

[ Beat. ]

I mean, seriously into moto--

[ Ed slaps Todd again, knocking him out of his chair.

LIGHTS OUT.]

GIRLY GOSSIP



[ LIGHTS UP ON STEPH AND KELSEY, SEATED AND TALKING. ]

STEPH:
Girl.

KELSEY:
Girl.

STEPH:
Can you believe it?

KELSEY:
I can't believe it.

STEPH:
Can you believe he did that?

KELSEY:
No way.

STEPH:
Yes way.

KELSEY:
Oh my god.

STEPH:
Oh my god.

KELSEY:
That's so wrong.

STEPH:
That's not all.

KELSEY:
No way.

STEPH:
Listen.

[ They start whispering and giggling.

JOEL ENTERS in a sweet jacket. He has a cheap microphone. ]

JOEL:
Man.

[ CURTIS ENTERS with a Casio keyboard. He plays a simple drum pattern. ]

JOEL:
Let's do this. One, two, one two three. Four, five, six seven eight. Numbers, counting, starting off a song.

 [ Curtis plays a simple melody. Joel begins to sing. ]

 What these women talkin' about?

CURTIS:
Girly gossip, girly gossip.

JOEL:
What these ladies squawkin' about?

CURTIS:
Girly gossip, girly gossip.

JOEL:
 What these honeys spreadin' round town?

CURTIS:
Girly gossip, girly gossip.

JOEL:
Talkin' that trash to bring a man down.

CURTIS:
Girly gossip, girly gossip.

JOEL:
Talkin' and a squawkin' and a-spreadin' them lies!
Breakin' my heart and my eye makes cries!

CURTIS:
Girly gossip, girly gossip, girly gossip, girly gossip.

JOEL: [ speaking ]
Girl, I been hearing these lies you been sayin', spreadin' all around this town, sayin' I don't look good with my shirt off, sayin' I smell real funny -- like CHEESE -- and I be sweatin' all the time -- like sweaty cheese. You know it ain't like that.

I've seen all your friends lookin' at me, whisperin' that I'm boring. Sayin' things like I never return anything I borrow, that I delete your shows off the digital video recorder, that I never do nice things for you. Now, come on, girl, you know it ain't like that.

Girl, I see them words comin' off your lips, sayin' I'm emotionally retarded, that I'm bad listener, totally insensitive, a selfish lover and an unreliable friend. Girl, you know it ain't like that.

Girl, I heard you talkin'. I heard you tellin' all your friends that I'm passive-aggressive, that I'm a liar and a fraud, that I subscribe to white supremacist newsletters. Girl, I ain't even tryin' to hear that.

Girl, you've been doin' a lot of talkin', I know. I know you've been talkin' all over town. But you know what, girl, it doesn't matter. All that talk doesn't matter to me. No it don't, girl.

[ He pulls out a stack of documents. ]

Because I've obtained a legally binding injunction against you discussing any of the details of our relationship with anyone. Breach of this injunction will result in a substantial cash penalty along with reimbursement for any attorney's fees I may incur.

[ Pause. Sings. ]

What these women talkin' about?

CURTIS:
Girly gossip, girly gossip.

JOEL:
 What these ladies squawkin' about?

CURTIS and JOEL:
Girly gossip, girly gossip, girly gossip, girly gossip!

[ Pause. Curtis switches off the drumbeat. Kelsey and Steph approach Joel. ]

KELSEY:
Joel, we didn't know that you felt that way.

STEPH:
We didn't realize that our frank discussions of you were so hurtful.

KELSEY:
If you don't approve of people openly exchanging information about your behavior, then we'll stop.

JOEL:
I appreciate that, ladies.

CURTIS:
Joel, I would also like to apologize to you. For anything and everything.

JOEL:
Thanks, Curtis.

[ JACK ENTERS the stage. ]

JACK:
Joel! We got a call on the red telephone! Darth Vader and Skeletor have escaped from space prison! You, Bruce Lee, and Rick Springfield are the only ones that can save humanity!

JOEL:
I'm on my way!

[ Joel makes as though to exit, then pauses. ]

Wait a minute.

[ Beat. ]

Everyone's apologizing to me, I express my feelings through song, and I get to fight crime with Bruce Lee and Rick Springfield?

[ Beat. ]

Is today my birthday?

CURTIS:
No, Joel. This is a dream.

[ Joel groans. ]

STEPH:
But we need you to take a message back to the waking world for us.

[ She whispers in his ear. Joel recoils in horror. ]

JOEL:
That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.

STEPH:
What??

[ Curtis hits a dissonant chord on the keyboard. LIGHTS FLICKER UP AND DOWN as everyone runs about. Eventually, everyone gets back into their positions from the beginning of the show, right after Joel choked himself out with the limbo pole. ]

STEPH:
Wake up, Joel, wake up!

[ Joel sits up, startled. ]

JOEL:
What?? What?? I don't want to go to school the other kids don't like me I peed myself!

CURTIS:
Joel, you choked yourself out with that limbo pole.

STEPH:
You've been out for the past sixty to eighty minutes.

CURTIS:
Fortunately, for some curious reason, we were able to see everything that you dreamed about right here, on this stage.

JOEL:
Makes sense. Was it funny?

[ Steph and Curtis shrug. ]

STEPH:
Kind of. It was a little sad.

CURTIS:
Try to dream funnier next time, Joel.

JOEL:
OK, next performance, I'll try to have some better dreams.

STEPH:
No, now!!

[ Steph begins strangling Joel. ]

JOEL:
Here we go again!

[ He shrugs.

LIGHTS OUT.

MUSIC UP.

LIGHTS UP so we can thank the audience and such. ] 


AD EXEC
Thanks for your time, Mr. Brewster. It’s a pleasure to meet you face to face. I was at games three and four of the ‘93 World Series.

BREWSTER
You must have been just a tiny young thing.

AD EXEC
Oh, stop it. I was, though, actually. But I still remember that steal in the fifth inning.

BREWSTER
It was a good one.

AD EXEC
So, you can imagine how excited I am to welcome you as the new public face of Plumpems Double-Decker Dogs.

BREWSTER
I love hot dogs, so I think I can endorse them in a very authentic way. And of course, hot dogs and baseball … there’s an organic connection.

AD EXEC
Naturally. Now, we have a legitimate challenge here. The hot dog is an American classic. People don’t always like it when you mess with a classic.

BREWSTER
So what’s the thing about this hot dog?

AD EXEC
It’s a double decker dog. So it’s like … two.

BREWSTER Just one on top of the other.

AD EXEC
Yeah, there’s basically a thin membrane like … between the two dogs. So they’re linked together, like siamese dogs.

BREWSTER
Gotcha. You’re basically getting two hot dogs.

AD EXEC
Absolutely. Our target is people who’d like to have two hot dogs instead of just one.

BREWSTER
Makes sense.

AD EXEC
We think the most natural appeal is to the “hungry man” demographic. You know, “boom, eat this.” “Bam, here’s some food for your mouth.” “This is man meat, brother.” It’s important that Plumpems Double-Decker Dogs are perceived as masculine, powerful.

BREWSTER
You chose the right spokesman.

[ He laughs. ]

AD EXEC
Absolutely. Now, we want a series of television spots, all linked together with the same premise: This hot dog just keeps beating you.

BREWSTER
What do you mean?

AD EXEC
You know, making a fool of you. Getting the jump on you at every turn. Mastering you. Defeating you. Shaming you. Umm … I’m sure there are some other synonyms … Conquering you. Embarrassing you. Making you look like a chump, a loser, a patsy. Thrashing you. Annihilating you. Sending you back to school. Humiliating you.

BREWSTER
Could you be a little more specific?

AD EXEC
Here’s one idea. You’re playing a charity game. You’re on third, and you go for the steal, like in ‘93. You think you’re safe, but the ref calls you out. You look down and see, oops, that Plumpems Double-Decker Dog is there, and it tagged you out. Tagline: “You can’t beat a Plumpems Double-Decker Dog.”

BREWSTER
How does he tag me out?

AD EXEC
He has a glove. We see that he’s got the ball. It’ll work, I promise.


BREWSTER
So I’m playing baseball, the thing I’m known for being really good at, which my name and reputation are built on, and I get beat by the hot dog.

AD EXEC
That’s right.

BREWSTER
Sounds fun. What else?

AD EXEC
Well, we want to make sure these spots have broad appeal. There are lots of folks out there who know your face, but don’t really care about baseball.

BREWSTER
Sure.

AD EXEC
Maybe you’re trying to get your kid into the last available spot at an elite private school. You’re talking to the principal. She says, “Mr. Brewster, I have some bad news.” And you see this hot dog kid in one of the classrooms. He’s a miniature double-decker dog, wearing a little backpack. And you hear someone laughing at you, and you turn around and--

BREWSTER It’s that damn hot dog!

AD EXEC
He beat you again. He beat you.

BREWSTER
You know what’d be the damndest thing? What if the hot dog steals my wife away?

AD EXEC
Oh, I love it!

BREWSTER
I come home, and my wife is glowing. Happier than I’ve ever seen her. She’s radiant. And I say, “Good day?” And she’s like, “Twice as good.” And I’m like, “What’s that mean?” Then I see a used condom in our bed, but it’s like, two condoms, together, get it? And whoops, it’s “That damn hot dog!”

AD EXEC
I love it. That won’t work on television, but I like that you’re getting into the spirit.

BREWSTER
Oh, sure. Maybe she just leaves me and they get married.

AD EXEC
Are you comfortable putting your kids on camera?

BREWSTER
I’m sure they’d love it.

AD EXEC
We’d love to do one where they choose the hot dog as their new father. We’d love a close-up of your daughter spitting in your face, and a long shot of you crying.

BREWSTER
Haha! That damn hot dog! I just can’t win! He’s got me beat like a dog!

AD EXEC
I think these ads are going to take off. We can build to a final showdown between you and the hot dog. Something to play during a major TV event.

BREWSTER
Hell, it should be the World Series, right? People will want to see this hot dog defeat me on my home turf.

AD EXEC
Perfect. And I think we just make it literal at that point. It’s a literal fight between you and the Plumpems Double Decker. We hype it up as the ultimate showdown. But the joke is you never lay a glove on the hot dog. It dominates you completely from the first second.

BREWSTER
Right, the dog’s just beating me like a rented mule from square one.

AD EXEC
Just making you look like a weak fool.

BREWSTER
Like a weak damn fool. A pathetic child.

AD EXEC
It’s slamming your face against the pavement.



BREWSTER
My parents are still alive. We should put them in the spot! They’re watching me, wincing, embarrassed. It’d be a hoot.

AD EXEC
Finally, the hot dog digs a shallow grave, tosses you in, and buries you.

BREWSTER And that’s it. I’m dead, and he won.

AD EXEC
You never even had a chance, for a single second. The hot dog is your master and superior. All your accomplishments, all that you ever achieved … It meant nothing.

BREWSTER
I gotta tell you, this just sounds like a lot of fun. I mean, the money y’all are offering me is very, very generous, but I gotta say, I’d do it for free. I mean it just sounds fun!

AD EXEC
Let me put a provocative idea out here. I just want to feel you out on this. What if you die?

BREWSTER
I thought that’s what we were talking about?

AD EXEC
No, I mean what if you … die?

BREWSTER
Oh, I see.

AD EXEC
To make it more of a real event. We’ll have a beautifully dignified ceremony for you. Your kids will be taken care of. We’ll send them to college. A state college. If they want to attend a private college, they can put the tuition for the state college toward the cost of the private college. Can we get your wife to wear a hot dog blazer to the funeral? Your coffin will also be filled with Double Decker Hot Dogs. It’s kind of a final, so to speak, fuck you.

BREWSTER
Hell, I’ll do it. You know how many damn times I got hit on the head with a baseball? This is a great way to go. I’ve got the brain of an eighty year old. I been beaned so many times they call me Johnny Frijole. I’ve taken so many walks, they call me Immanuel Kant.


AD EXEC
We’re gonna need you to rap.

BREWSTER
I love to rap! My lyrics aren’t the best, but I’ve got distinctive flow. Give me a beat and I’ll show you!


wwwIT'S YOUR SHOW, VINCENT VAN GOGH



[ LIGHTS UP on STEPH. ]

STEPH:
It's your show ... Vincent Van Gogh!

[ JOEL ENTERS dressed as Vincent Van Gogh. He carries a bottle of absinthe and a glass. He sits at a table, pours himself a glass. STEPH EXITS. PARISIAN MUSIC PLAYS. ]

VINCENT VAN GOGH:
Name's Vincent. Vincent van Gogh.

[ Beat. ]

Stars. Fuckin’ stars. They say there’s billions of ‘em. I didn’t count. Maybe, I don’t know. I care? No. Fuck it.

[ Beat. ]

Bright though, sometimes, you look at ‘em right and you’ve had just enough. Absinthe is best. Sweet lady absinthe. That’s where I live, baby. Twinkle, twinkle. Drink drink, gaze gaze, dab dab dab. They say the sun is a star. Fuck the sun. Never did anything for me but wake me up from a good night’s sleep. Makes my head pound. So, the sun’s a star; I say, fuck the stars. And fuck you. But I’ll paint ‘em. I’ll sure as fuckfire paint the shit out of those stars. Gimme a twinkle and I’ll paint you too, maybe. Who knows?

[ Beat. ]

So maybe all those other stars up there, they got planets whizzing around ‘em just like us, and maybe on one of those planets there’s another me, drinking a third glass of absinthe in some piece of shit bar and answering fuckin’ questions posed by blank-faced dumbfucks like you.

[ Silence. ]

Christ, I gotta take a crap.

[ VAN GOGH EXITS stage for a good thirty seconds, then ENTERS again. ]

False alarm.

[ Pours himself another glass. ]

It does it to you like that, sometimes. Ties your goddam guts up in so many knots you don’t know what’s comin’ or goin’. Works the other way, too, sometimes. Sittin’ on an afternoon train to Paris, you know, not knowin’ that people are ditching the dining car ‘cuz you just laid a big fuckin’ crap on the floor. Well, leave me the car, sonsabitches. That’s the way I like it. Leave me in fuckin’ peace and quiet to eat my fuckin’ pudding.

[ Pause. ]

Pudding. Good banana pudding has no rival in my fuckin’ mind, man. Nothing in the world. You can take your flan and you can put it, I say, right up your ass. Sweeter than milk from mama’s tit, pudding is. Let’s have some of that tasty shit.

[ Van Gogh takes a pudding cup and small wooden spoon from his jacket pocket, opens it up, pours a small amount of absinthe into the cup, starts eating. ]

Motherfucking yum.

[ Beat. ]

Talent? Who says talent? That ain’t what it’s about kids--not now and never will be. Bustin’ balls, that’s me. Bustin’ my fuckin’ nuts every morning, noon, and night, paint under my nails, rubbing my fuckin’ knuckles raw, smellin’ the oils ‘till I think they must be killing my brain. That’s me. You think I was squawling in my crib with a goddam brush in my hand? Takes work, motherfucker. Talent is what fuckin’ amateurs spend all day bitchin’ at themselves for not having.

[ Beat. ]

That’s why I’m me and you’re you.

[ Beat. ]

Gaugin, he understood that much. Not much else. Slick motherfucker, he was. Moustache, and always with the hats. And me saying to him, again with the hat? Again with the hat? And him giving me the same old bullshit about fuckin’ headcolds. And look at me, bald as a babe, out there taking my evening constitutional, unhatted, every night in the middle of fuckin’ winter and do you see me sneezing? You see me let out a cough or a piece of snot danglin’ from my nose? No, you don’t.

[ Beat. ]

Gaugin, though, he liked his hats. What makes a man a man? Who the hell knows. Maybe he needed it or some shit like that. Maybe you take the hat off Guagin and he don’t paint worth a shit. Fuckin’ . . . like the guy in the Bible. Big brawly bastard gets a haircut and now he’s a pussy. It’s in there, look it up. Never much of a theologian myself. Bullshit, I say. The shit about the magic hair and shit like that. I like a good psalm, though. A little poetry, some language, you know, some rhetoric--something that’ll put a real tingle in your sack.

[ Beat. ]

So Gaugin’s in his hat, see. We’re out at a cafe. Same old, same old. I haven’t slept in like three days. I’m on a roll, see, nailin’ hookers and painting like I’m in my prime. Four self-portraits in forty-eight hours, two landscapes in twenty-four. All pretty good. Some not the best, but, you know, you don’t strike gold every fuckin’ time. But you keep digging. And this was good shit.

[ Beat. ]

Killing hookers, too, see? You gotta. Fuck I’m gonna pay a woman for sex and let her go around knowin’ that shit? Blabbin’ it all over town about that freaky one-ear fuck and his bizarre bedroom behavior? Not a chance. Not in hell, kiddos. So I’m paintin’, and I’m killin’ hookers. And for each hooker that I strangle and dump in the river, the muse pays a visit to my bedside, and I’m paintin’ like a fiend. Ain’t no one got nothing on my shit. Not Rubens in his day, you hear me?

[ Silence. Van Gogh laughs. ]

You believe that shit? Come on, fella. Lighten the fuck up. Bullshit. Van Gogh is clean, baby.

[ CURTIS ENTERS WITH AN ENVELOPE. MUSIC STOPS. ]

CURTIS:
Joel! Check it out.

JOEL:
What?

CURTIS:
Steph!

[ STEPH ENTERS. ]

A bicycle courier gave this to me backstage.

[ Curtis pulls letter out of the envelope. ]

It's a cease and desist letter from the Van Gogh estate.

[ Joel snatches the letter, begins reading. ]

JOEL:
"... gross defamation of a proud legacy ..."

[ Steph snatches the letter. ]

STEPH:
"... completely grotesque mischaracterization ..."

[ Joel snatches the letter. ]

JOEL:
"... legal action may be necessary ..."

[ Steph snatches the letter. ]

STEPH:
"... immediate cancellation of this and all future performances ..."

[ Beat. ]

How long was that?

JOEL:
Five minutes, at most.

CURTIS:
It's our new cease-and-desist record!

[ Curtis snatches the letter. ]

Let's hang it up with the ones from the Thomas Edison and F. Scott Fitzgerald estates!

[ EVERYONE EXITS. LIGHTS OUT. ]


[ PLAY CLIP 1. ]

[ LIGHTS UP SIMULTANEOUSLY ]

MA: Oh, my good lord. It was nothin’ more than a humbug and a hullabaloo!

PA: Bless me, Ma, but I half believed the whole thing was real!

MA: Me too, Pa! Can you imagine?

PA: [ scoffing ] Martians invading the earth!

MA: That’ll be the day.

PA: I’ll be a pig in a poke.

MA: I’ll be reverend to a rhubarb.

PA: I’ll be … I’ll be …

MA: What?

PA: Fuck. Never mind.

MA: Well, I’ll be diggity-dag-doggedy-diggled if I ever get snookered by the gul-durmed radio ever again, that’s for certain!

PA: Me too! Or me neither? You know what I mean.

[ LIGHTS DOWN ]

NICE BUS DRIVER



[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO MURDERERS, STAGE RIGHT, RIFLING THROUGH THE CONTENTS OF A SUITCASE ON A TABLE. Stage left: in darkness, some chairs arranged to resemble a bus. ]

MURDERER 1:
I hate hotel jobs.

MURDERER 2:
Yeah.

MURDERER 1:
Too much cleanup.

MURDERER 2:
Yeah.

[ They pull a box of trashbags and a can of Comet out of the suitcase. ]

MURDERER 1
We using your car?

MURDERER 2
No.

MURDERER 1
We're using my car?

MURDERER 2
That's the idea.

MURDERER 1
Why not your car?

MURDERER 2
Because I took the bus.

[ They pull a roll of duct tape and a small length of rope out of the suitcase. ]

MURDERER 1
The bus, huh?

MURDERER 2
I like taking the bus.

MURDERER 1
Me too. I wish more routes went by my house.

MURDERER 2
The driver's a nice guy, too. Real mensch.

MURDERER 1
Bus drivers are the best, aren't they?

MURDERER 2
Sure are.

[ They pull a couple of large butcher knives from the suitcase. ]

Why, I'll tell you what happened today. Fare is one dollar, as you know --

MURDERER 1
Good deal, compared to the price of gas.

MURDERER 2
-- fare is one dollar. Normally, I don't even check for it before I leave the house. I always have plenty of change in my pocket. But today –

[ LIGHTS DIM ON STAGE RIGHT, LIGHTS UP ON STAGE LEFT as Murderer 2 scurries over and BUS DRIVER ENTERS and takes his seat.

Murderer 2 “boards” the bus and begins checking his pockets. ]

DRIVER:
Fare is one dollar, guy.

[ Murderer 2 pulls out 3 quarters. ]

MURDERER 2
Dang it. I'm sorry, I figured I had it, but I've only got 75 cents.

[ Bus driver smiles, jerks his thumb toward the back of the bus. ]

DRIVER
Just get on, willya?

[ LIGHTS DIM ON STAGE LEFT, LIGHTS UP ON STAGE RIGHT as Murderer 2 scurries over and BUS DRIVER EXITS. ]

MURDERER 1
How about that!

MURDERER 2
They never split hairs over that kind of stuff.

MURDERER 1
I love bus drivers.

[ They each pull a gun out of the suitcase, check the barrels, cock them. They get into a crouching position, guns trained at the “door.” They are waiting for someone. ]

MURDERER 2
You hear something?

MURDERER 1
Just someone upstairs.

MURDERER 2
I hate hotels.

MURDERER 1
You know, I had a pleasant experience with the bus driver the other day.

MURDERER 2
Did you?

MURDERER 1
When I have to catch the bus in the morning, I'm usually very careful about setting my alarm.

MURDERER 2
You have to be at your stop on time.

MURDERER 1
Precisely.

MURDERER 2
Or else you might miss your bus.

MURDERER 1
Exactly. But this particular time, I had forgotten to set my alarm the night before. Consequently, I awoke 10 minutes late. And then …

[ They relax and let their guns fall. LIGHTS DIM ON STAGE RIGHT, LIGHTS UP ON STAGE LEFT as Murderer 1 scurries over and BUS DRIVER ENTERS and takes his seat.

Murderer 1 is “running behind the bus.” ]

MURDERER 1
Hey! Hey!

[ Bus Driver looks in rear view mirror, then hits the brakes.

Murderer 1 catches up with the bus and boards. ]

DRIVER:
Overslept, huh?

MURDERER 1
Yeah.

[ Bus Driver smiles. ]

DRIVER:
Happens to us all!

[ He jerks his thumb toward the back of the bus. ]

Now get on, willya?

[ LIGHTS DIM ON STAGE LEFT, LIGHTS UP ON STAGE RIGHT as Murderer 1 scurries over and BUS DRIVER EXITS. ]

MURDERER 2
What a nice bus driver.

MURDERER 1
So helpful.

MURDERER 2
He used the power that he had to make your day better.

[ They suddenly tense up, point their guns at the door, hold their breath. A beat. ]

MURDERER 2
Just a noise.

[ They relax a little, but keep their guns pointed at the door. ]

MURDERER 2
But I'll tell you what. I've got an even better story.

[ LIGHTS DIM ON STAGE RIGHT, LIGHTS UP ON STAGE LEFT as Murderer 2 scurries over and BUS DRIVER ENTERS and takes his seat.

Murderer 2 is asleep on the bus. The bus driver shifts the bus into Park, wipes his forehead. He glances in the passenger-view mirror. ]

DRIVER:
Hey buddy! Wake up!

[ Murderer 2 stirs. ]

MURDERER 2
Wha –

DRIVER:
Nice nap, buddy?

MURDERER 2
Aw, God damn it. Is this the bus depot?

DRIVER:
That's right.

MURDERER 2
Sorry. I missed my stop.

[ He stands. ]

I'll call a cab. Is it all right for me to stay here until--

DRIVER:
Hold on, buddy. You haven't missed your stop.

[ He shifts the bus into drive. ]

MURDERER 2
No, really, I couldn't possibly.

[ Bus driver jerks his thumb. ]

DRIVER:
Sit down, willya?

[ Murderer 2 sits and smiles.

LIGHTS DIM ON STAGE LEFT, LIGHTS UP ON STAGE RIGHT as Murderer 2 scurries over and BUS DRIVER EXITS. ]

MURDERER 1
What a great guy.

MURDERER 2
Bus drivers are basically the best human beings out there.

MURDERER 1
God's own truth.

MURDERER 2
You better believe it.

[ Murderer 1 checks his watch. ]

MURDERER 1
Any minute now.

[ They both raise their guns. ]

MURDERER 2
Ironic, isn't it?

MURDERER 1
Is it?

MURDERER 2
Sure it is.

MURDERER 1
I feel like every time I say that something is ironic someone tells me it's not really ironic.

MURDERER 2
I'm pretty sure this is ironic.

MURDERER 1
If you say so.

[ BUS DRIVER ENTERS STAGE RIGHT with a suitcase. He sees the two murderers. ]

DRIVER:
Hey, I'm sorry. There must be some kind of mixup. They gave me this room at the front desk.

[ He smiles and jerks his thumb. ]

Get out of here, willya?

[ Beat. ]

Just kidding.

[ The murderers shoot the bus driver dozens of times. He collapses on the floor and dies.

Long pause. ]

MURDERER 1
In light of our most recent conversation, I feel pretty bad about this.

MURDERER 2
I know what you mean.

[ Beat. ]

MURDERER 1
All right. Let's cut off his limbs and head...

MURDERER 2
Don't forget to drain his blood...

BOTH
... and stuff him in this suitcase.

[ They start grabbing their tools as the lights FADE TO BLACK. ]


SPECIAL VICTIMS



[ LIGHTS UP. A police officer is standing behind a desk or counter of some kind. A MAN enters, looking nervous and shaken. He approaches the cop. ]

COP
Can I help you?

MAN
Yes. I … I need to report a crime.

COP
You’re in the right place.

MAN
Um, yes.

COP
What’s the crime, sir?

MAN Um … I’m sorry, I’m a little …

COP
It’s all right, sir. There’s no judgment here. This is the police department.

MAN
Thank you.

COP
You’re welcome. Now, what’s happened?

MAN
I was … someone was sexually aggressive with me at Carl’s Jr.

COP
Was it a Carl’s Jr. employee?

MAN
I’m not sure. He was wearing a Carl’s Jr. uniform.

COP
So, at the very least, he was impersonating a Carl’s Jr. employee.

MAN
Yes. I’m sorry. This is hard.

COP
I understand, sir. Now can you explain exactly what happened?

MAN
I was at the counter, placing my order. I asked for a combination. I’m sorry, I can’t remember which number.

COP
That’s all right, sir.

MAN
The man across the counter suggested that, because I had ordered fries as part of my combination, I liked salty things. I said yes. He asked if I was a salty boy. I told him that I didn’t know what that meant. And then he began reaching across the counter to place his hands on my genitals, multiple times.

COP
What did you do?

MAN
I didn’t know what to do.

COP
That’s all right, sir.

MAN
No one did anything. They just kept waiting in line. All they could think about was their stupid hamburgers.

COP
Sir, it’s all right now. Because you are a … very special victim!

[ Cop pulls out a little gift basket from behind the counter. He pulls out a blowout noisemaker, and a few streamers, which he throws into the man’s face. Pause. ]

MAN
What?

COP
Sir, you’re the victim of a sex crime. And sex crimes are the most special crimes of all. Making sex crime victims the most special victims! Hurray!

MAN
Wow … awesome!

COP
You’ve really hit the jackpot, sir. I hope you enjoy this basket of special gifts. Special gifts for a truly special victim!

[ Another cop enters. ]

COP 2
Hey, did I hear we got a special victim in here?

COP
That’s right!

COP 2
Oooooone second!

[ The second cop exits, re-enters with a large sombrero. He puts the sombrero on the man’s head. ]

COPS
Oh, someone’s very special
That someone is you
Cuz someone had a sex crime
That someone is you!

And though we’re very sorry
For the pain that you went through
At least you’re very special
So special, that’s you!

[ The man claps. ]

MAN
Hurray!



SPECIAL VICTIMS PT. 2



[ LIGHTS UP. Two cops, hanging out behind the desk or counter. ]

COP 1
I love this job.

COP 2
Really? Because I really like it, but I don’t love it.

COP 1
That’s fair. Everyone is different.

[ The man enters. ]

MAN
Hey, guys.

[ Cops glance over. ] 
COP 1
Sir? May we help you?

MAN
Hey, it’s … uh, it’s me?

COP 2
Sorry, sir?

MAN
One of your … you know, special victims.

COP 1
Sir … I’m sorry, we do get an awful lot of special victims.

COP 2
We’re thinking about setting up a unit dedicated to special victims.

MAN
That’s cool! I mean -- that’s cool.

COP 2
Do you remember the case number?

MAN
Oh yes, of course! Of course! I’ve memorized it. SV-CJ-18A3

COP 1
The Carl’s Jr. incident?

MAN
Yes! Yes, that’s it!

COP 1
Sir, that case is closed. A suspect has been arrested, and he’s due to stand trial in a week.

MAN
Yeah.

COP 1
So … ?

MAN
It’s just … the last time I came here, you guys made me feel really special.

COP 2
Oh, sir.

COP 1
You are special, sir.

COP 2
You’ll always be a special victim, in a sense.

MAN
Whatever. It’s fine, I’ll go...

COP 1
Sir, this is actually a problem we deal with frequently. After you’ve become a special victim, giving it up can be quite difficult.

COP 2
That’s why we use the services of professional therapist.

[ Cop 2 removes cop hat, pulls out a little boombox, presses play. New Age-y music begins to play. ]


[ The neighbors take the stage. ]

CURTIS
You guys, we totally forgot -- I’m sorry, folks -- we were supposed to do this Encyclopedia thing but we totally forgot that we have this meeting downstairs.

COURTNEY
Oh! Okay, Curtis, you go down and represent us and we’ll do the sketch.

CURTIS
You...you guys can handle my lines? Joel?

JOEL
Sure! No problem. Easy. You have the easiest lines, Curtis.

CURTIS
Courtney?
COURTNEY
Easy peasy, Curtis. A baby could do your lines, Curtis. A baby has done your lines, Curtis.

CURTIS
O...Okay.

[ Curtis does the “down the stairs” walk behind the podium, and it looks terrible. Hides behind podium with the mic. ]

JOEL
So, cinnamon. Yeah, Joel, cinnamon. That's right Curtis, cinnamon.

[ Courtney pulls out a thing of cinnamon. ]

COURTNEY
For example, the cinnamon that you see here. Is that cinnamon you have there, Courtney? Yes, Curtis, what I have right here is cinnamon.

JOEL
A great spice, you guys! A really important spice.

COURTNEY
Yup. Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several trees from the genus Cinnamomum.

JOEL
90% of it comes from Sri Lanka. 90%, Joel? 90%, Curtis. Funny, I know, because Sri Lanka is so well known for its amazing porno. Ew, Joel!

COURTNEY
Ew, Joel. Cinnamon, use it in sweet stuff! Use it in savory stuff...I love it on toast. I know you do, Curtis! Such a sweet tooth on this guy!

JOEL
I think we can agree, just a tremendous spice. A great spice all around, with a great story as well! The kind of story one would only find in a Sri Lankan porno.

COURTNEY
Also, there’s something called the Cinnamon Challenge.

JOEL [ quickly ]
Cinnamon Challenge?

COURTNEY [ quickly, spooning out some cinnamon for her and for Joel ]
Cinnamon Challenge, Joel. Just take a tablespoon of cinnamon, just a little tablespoon, and you--

[ Massive Gozer-like sound effect. ]

CINNAMON [ Curtis on mic ]
Who cries out thrice for the challenge?

[ COURTNEY is startled, drops the cinnamon. ]

Pick me up!

[ Courtney and Joel stare at the cinnamon. ]

Pick me up?

[ Courtney and Joel stare at the cinnamon. ]

Pick me up, pick me up, pick me up, pick me up, pick me up--

COURTNEY
Pick up the cinnamon, Courtney! OK! Jesus!

[ Courtney picks up the cinnamon. ]

JOEL
Hey, Courtney, this cinnamon is talking to us.

COURTNEY
I know, Joel.

CINNAMON
Who cries out thrice for the challenge?

COURTNEY
... Oh, the cinnamon challenge?

JOEL [ quickly ]
Cinnamon Challenge?

COURTNEY [ quickly ]
Cinnamon Challenge, Joel. Just take a teaspoon--

CINNAMON
Yes! Except no!

COURTNEY
No?

CINNAMON
This is a challenge more ancient, deeper and more dire!

JOEL
Cool.

CINNAMON
It is cool! In cool ancient times, many millennia ago, human beings and cinnamon battled for dominion over all the earth.

COURTNEY [ skeptical ]
Really?

CINNAMON
Yes.

JOEL [ amazed ]
Really!?

CINNAMON
Yes.

COURTNEY
Cinnamon?

CINNAMON
What?

[ beat ]

COURTNEY
Really?

CINNAMON
Yes!

COURTNEY
Well, that sounds stupid!

CINNAMON
It’s not. It’s cool.

JOEL
It does sound stupid.

COURTNEY
Were other spices involved?

CINNAMON
What?

COURTNEY
In the big battle. Were any other spices involved?

CINNAMON
No! Cinnamon and humans, battling for supremacy!

JOEL
Other spices were neutral.

CINNAMON
And every millennium, the challenge must be entered once again. Battle me, humans, for dominion of the earth.

JOEL
OK?

COURTNEY
I mean, at the very least, this will be an interesting thing involving cinnamon.

CINNAMON
Mwahahaha! Prepare your feeble bodies and minds for The Cinnamon Challenge.

JOEL
Done!

CINNAMON
I challenge you to wade through this.....massive tub of pudding and find the red flag! You have 15 seconds!

COURTNEY
MMMM...mkay!

CINNAMON
Go!

[ It's a normal tub of pudding. A beeping clock noise plays. She pulls the flag out of the pudding. The beeping noise stops. It's been like 2 seconds. She and Joel celebrate with high fives.]

CINNAMON
Very good, very good, human. But I have more cinnamon challenges for you! I have placed......three balloons in the aisles of the audience! You must pop them all in 15 seconds! Here are your pins!

[The timer starts again. They pop the balloons really fast. The timer stops. Joel and Courtney celebrate with high fives]

COURTNEY
So easy! Easy like Curtis' lines! Hey! Well?! They are super easy!

CINNAMON
Well met! This is proving to be the most impressive display any humans have every displayed while participating in the cinnamon challenge! I have one more challenge for you!

JOEL
Yesssss! This is gonna be so easy. Don't gloat to a spice, Joel!

CINNAMON
You must find a ticket hidden within this......oversized stack of pancakes!

[the timer noise starts. Joel finds the ticket. They celebrate. Joel showboats]

COURTNEY
Those pancakes look really good...

[ Courtney sprinkles cinnamon on them and eats them. ]

CINNAMON
Don’t eat me, human. I have so much to offer your world. I can share with you the boundless wonders of my culture.

COURTNEY
What about art? Does cinnamon have art?

JOEL
What about love?

COURTNEY
And science.

JOEL
And poetry! Poetry’s my favorite!

COURTNEY
Pants? I love pants.

JOEL
And porno!

COURTNEY
Joel, no.

JOEL
Well? Do they have porno? I bet it’s pretty hot.

CINNAMON
No! We don’t have porno!

JOEL
Do it Courtney.

CINNAMON
No! Nooooo! Arrrrgh! I’m just a spice!!

[ Curtis comes “back up the stairs.” ]

CURTIS
Guys, I just had a great meeting!

JOEL
Tell us about it, Curtis!

CURTIS
Turns out that we booked that big gig next weekend! Your Terrific Neighbors are playing Bonnaroo, y’all!

JOEL
Awesome!

[ COURTNEY starts wheezing, crying. ]

CURTIS
Hey, hey...

JOEL
It’s OK, Courtney!

CURTIS
Yeah, Courtney, this is great news.

COURTNEY
It’s not that.

JOEL
No?

COURTNEY
This cinnamon is burning my mouth, guys.

[Cinnamon's laughter plays overhead]

TOGETHER
And that’s the end of the--
That’s the end of the--
That’s the end of the--
Skeeeeeee-yetch!


NARRATOR
Now, every good Yankee boy and girl knows the story better than I can tell it: The Tale of Johnny Appleseed. Now, Johnny, they say, was born John Chapman in Leominster, Massachusetts. As a young man, Johnny showed a great passion for things of the earth that grow, like trees and bushes and living rocks, which they had back in those days and called “golems.” One day, Johnny’s feet got an itch for some wandering. Throwing a pan on his head as a symbolic “fuck you” to the day’s haberdashical fashions, Johnny went west, and planted apple trees wherever he journeyed. Those trees were sustenance and perpetual blessing to the people of a young nation, and the legend of gentle Johnny and his sweet fruits grew riper and juicier every year. In fact, as the years fell by, it inspired a whole pack of footstep-followers, and perhaps none of them was more driven and determined than Robert Coolsbee, a New Hampshire boy who came to callin’ himself “Johnny Applecheese.”

SONG
Well

JOHNNY
Well, here I am, on the rough frontier of western Ohio.

LOCAL
All that you see before you, sir, was once a land of savage barbarism. The original settlers to west Ohio were outcasts from the law who dreamed of settling in a place where it might be both legal and socially acceptable to kill and eat your own kin. And so it stood, until we were visited by the saintly Johnny Appleseed, who taught us that apples could be even more flavorful and sustaining then the raw flesh of a brother or daughter.

JOHNNY
If he came to you like a sugary Moses, I come to you as a savory Jesus, here to complete the testament.

LOCAL
What do you mean, sir?

JOHNNY
I come to spread the wisdom and vision that God has given me. Gather round, all ye folk of western Ohio! Gather at my feet and hear my gospel! Johnny Applecheese has come to show you more gifts of nature! Now, we all know the apple as a sweet treat that can’t be beat. But have you tried an apple with cheese?

[ Silence. ]

JOHNNY
No? You really should try it.

LOCAL
That seems like it would be weird.

JOHNNY
“Seems”? Aren’t there many things that “seem” on this earth? And ain’t it the devil who they say is the prince of illusions?

LOCAL
I don’t know about that. But the thought of mixing fruit and dairy like that kind of makes me feel a little sick to my stomach.

LOCAL 2
It’s weird. It’s just weird.

JOHNNY
Look, friends, the combination of the sweet and the salty … It’s a timeless combination of opposites that brings out the best in both.

LOCAL
Here in western Ohio, we don’t have much time for that kind of pseudo-Oriental thinking. Meat to meat, sweet to sweet, and never the two shall greet—that’s a saying that we have here and use frequently.

JOHNNY
Now let me tell you folks something. You ever try makin’ these apples into an apple pie?

[ Locals both blissfully rub their stomachs and lick their lips. ]

JOHNNY
There you go, there you are. Now, you ever try taking a nice, warm slice of apple pie, maybe a little dustin’ of cinnamon on that warm filling, with the lovely, doughy crust holding it all together … You ever take that pie and just put a nice slice of cheese right on top?

[ Locals start retching immediately. ]

JOHNNY
It’s a thing, I tell you! A real thing that people do and enjoy!


JUDGE
Robert Coolsbee, or Johnny Applecheese as you insist on calling yourself, today you stand on trial before a jury of your peers. You are accused of committing rank abominations against our mental categorizations of food. You are accused of placing profane images into the unsullied minds and souls of the public and contributing to the corruption of youth. You are accused of making citizens feel uncomfortable and queasy by forcing them to contemplate an unclean act involving fruit and dairy. How do you answer your accusers?

JOHNNY
Your honor, I’m just a man like so many hundreds of others in the early 19th century, traveling the young United States to spread awareness of a specific type of food. My accusers say that the thought of a slice of warm, melting cheddar cheese atop a big juicy slice of apple is foul, foul as the devil. But isn’t it true that fruit and dairy commingle together frequently? What of strawberry milkshakes? Is it possible that they aren’t part of god’s plan?

JUDGE [ bangs gavel ]
Milkshakes are different.

JOHNNY
What of ice cream? A dairy product with many fruity variations.

JUDGE
We are not here today to speak of ice cream, Mr. Applecheese.


NARRATOR
Alas, the pleas of Johnny Applecheese fell on deaf ears. The jury determined, and the judge agreed, that he would face a punishment more brutal and prolonged than any before visited on any man in the annals of human history.

JUDGE
For your crimes, Johnny Applecheese, the jury has devised punishments that would shock the feelings of a medieval inquisitor, punishments that, if I may speak impiously, make the sufferings of our lord and savior Jesus Christ seem soft and pale in comparison.

JOHNNY
I accept my fate as a sign of God’s grace. I hope to soon stand at my lord’s side, in a realm beyond death where all flavors are one.

JUDGE
Seize him!

NARRATOR
And so, Johnny Applecheese was seized. And his sufferings began. First, he was to be humbled before the community. His hair was shorn, and his beard plucked out by the local children, who mocked his tears and called him “big stupid.” He was dressed in the ratty garments of a town fool and made to caper atop hot coals, while singing a song of his own abasement, a song which had been quickly composed by a local musician and titled “Johnny Foul-and-Foolish”.

JOHNNY
Johnny Foul-and-Foolish
I go by that name
For acting foul and foolish
And never speaking plain

Pinch me! O pinch me now, strangers and friends!
Pinch me about my trunk and my ends!
Pinch me and poke me and call me by name,
Johnny Foul-and-Foolish! Yea, the very same!

NARRATOR
And so he was pinched and poked, from dusk till dawn, when he was clapped in irons in the town square, where passers-by were charged a penny apiece for the chance to hurl donkey dung at him. Then the incineration and removal of his bowels, a most difficult procedure to complete without killing its subject, but this town had retained a skilled specialist just for the purpose.


CURTIS
Jesus, what are we doing with this?

COURTNEY
People know the story of Johnny Applecheese. Everyone does. But people forget that it really happened. They forget that this was a real man with real flesh who really lived. It’s a visceral story that needs to be told with visceral imagery. People need to know how this man suffered for our sins. It’s like my friend Mel says: “What are you looking at, Johnny Sugar Tits?”

BRADEN
Mel Gibson?

COURTNEY
That’s right. Me and my friend Mel love to hang out and just talk about stuff that we both care about. Our values are very similar.

BRADEN

-- forced to drink 50 gallons of milk
-- a shirt of rotting curds
-- gives people apple products that have cheese in them, they like it until they are told what it is, then they freak out “You just said you loved it!”
-- JUDGE: “I do love a good cookie. Yum yum, gimme some. I hereby sentence me to lick this bowl of icing. Tough but fair!”
-- Judge is super sweet toothed.


DEATH OF A LION TAMER



[ SOUNDTRACK, WHICH GOES THROUGH THE ENTIRE SKETCH. LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A lion tamer enters. He carries a chair and a stick. He is taming a lion, invisible to the audience. He approaches the stage through the audience. ]

LION TAMER [ Eastern European accent ]
Alyona! Mishka! Hep-hep!

[ turns ]

Galechka! Oksana! Pip-pip-pip! Pip-pip-pip!

[ turns outward ]

Khoroshi khloptsi!

[ Applauds, bows to the audience. By this time, he is onstage. ]

Pip-pip-pip! Hep-hep! Oksana! Mishka!

[ He turns suddenly. ]

Ni, Alyona, ni! Zhump! ZHUMP!

[ A terrible howl. The lion tamer turns, and begins to scream, he holds up his hands in defense. ]

Mishkaaaaaaaa!

[ He freezes in place. ]

VOICEOVER
I have tamed many things in my life. Beasts. Women. The irresponsible spending habits of my youth. Yes, I have tamed many things. But now life has tamed me at last.

Hmmm. My speech is very odd. In death, it seems, I am no longer Ukrainian. It seems that in death is no country, no homeland. In death, there is only destination.

But I cannot be dead yet. No, not yet, for I still feel the excruciating pain of Mishka’s powerful jaws closed around my face. Yes, every tooth is a red hot ember of searing agony.

Ah, Mishka. Timid little broken Mishka. I should have known what mighty resentment slept within your shrinking frame. It is not the proud and strong who lash out with fury, but the frightened and desperate. Oh Mishka, Mishka, you were so easy to break, so simple to tame. But now you have broken me. You have broken my skull. I feel its juices already leaking. Oh, Mishka, the names I called you. Fat, lazy Mishka. Dull, charmless Mishka. Could your cat ears sense the notes of contempt in my voice? I misjudged you, Mishka. The jungle spirit was still in you. I could not drive it away.

It seems I am still not dead. I feel myself being tossed this way and that. I feel razor-sharp claws flaying the skin from my back. Now he is just showing off. It is fitting. Have your moment in the spotlight, Mishka.

Ah, but perhaps this is death? Perhaps this is what happens when you die? Your consciousness frozen in that last moment before death, trapped forever in the time before it is extinguished?

That would be such a ripoff.

This is stupid, really. This whole thing has been stupid. Lion taming is stupid. Why tame a lion? The circus, Jesus -- is this really a relevant form of entertainment in the 21st century? TV is very good these days, especially cable. Shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad deliver gripping, thoughtful entertainment on a regular basis. And the availability of shows on DVD and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu mean that even those without a regular cable subscription have access to and can enjoy these shows.

How can a circus compete with this? It’s barely holding on. Anyone can crunch the numbers and see. Ticket sales are down; insurance premiums are way up. The animal rights people are on our ass everywhere we go. And who can blame them? We treat these animals very, very poorly! This no kind of life for a wild animal. It’s no life for a human being. Spending half your day with clowns. And not birthday party clowns, people who actually went to a clown school and talk about “the art of clowning.” One stinking town after another. Bad food, dirty sheets. Christ, kill me now. I mean--you know what I mean.

I could have gotten out. Used my savings to take a class on Photoshop and Flash. Those are skills for the twenty-first century! Social media--I had ideas about social media! The circus had five more years in it, tops. I could have lived, lived life as a interactive graphic designer!

Did I just urinate on myself? Yes. In front of these people. My final act. My closing statement, as it were. Ugh, the lycra in my unitard is kind of trapping it in, keeping it in my crotch. My balls are kind of sloshing around in it. Wet and warm. Terrific. At least it distracts from the feeling of Mishka tearing my ligaments apart.

Ugh. I never finished my bucket list. Never finished writing my bucket list, even! I wonder if that movie was good. Probably not.

Wait, what’s that? Music. Music! A heavenly choir? Dare I believe it? That the superstitious tales of my childhood faith are real? That in death, we are welcomed into the next world with the singing of angels?

This sounds familiar, actually.

Is that Boyz II Men? OK. Those guys were pretty good, weren’t they?

And Mariah Carey! I’ve got no problem with her.

Yes! I am ready. Ready for the next life!

Soon I shall soar over the earth, seeing everyone and everything! The design of the entire cosmos! All is one and all is beautiful at rest! I shall see the beginning and the end, all time compressed to a single moment! The mystery revealed!

And I know you’re shining down on me from heaven,
Like so many friends we’ve lost along the way,
And I know eventually we’ll be together
Together
One sweet daaaaaay-aaaay

…

Um. OK? I’m ready now, for--you know--whatever it is. Kind of tired sitting here as this fucking lion chews on my throat.

…

Hello?

…

Come on. Come on!

…

Wait, something’s coming!

…

Aw, it’s a void! A void of eternal darkness and silence! Goddamit! Ripoooooooooofffffffffffffffffffff!

INTENTION CIRCLE



[ LIGHTS UP ON EVAN, A HIPPIE GURU, AND A DUDE PLAYING A DRUM. ]

EVAN:
Namaste, everyone.

DRUM GUY:
Namaste!

[ (Throughout the sketch, drum guy occasionally repeats things in chant.) ]

EVAN:
I’m so glad we could join in this sacred place to bring our spirit power together for our new friend, Jenna.

[ JENNA ENTERS. Everyone nods and Jenna raises her hands in a prayer-like motion to acknowledge them. ]

Jenna has been having a rough time, and we want to support her through it. So tonight Jenna will tell us about some of her darknesses and where she sees a path to the light. Then, we will join in a thought circle and focus on sending Jenna down that path. We will imagine her succeeding and attaining her goals. We will imagine all turmoil leaving her body and dispersing into nothing, leaving her filled with only happiness and peace.

[EVAN turns to JENNA.]

EVAN:
Jenna, know that through the beliefs of others, of all of us here with you, your solutions will be manifested. After tonight, your life will change for the better in all the ways you want it to.

JENNA:
I understand.

EVAN:
You are in a safe space. Here, you may feel at peace to share all your problems and know that they will dissolve in the face of the great power of our collective intentions for you.

JENNA:
That sounds really wonderful. Thank you all for helping me.

EVAN:
Please share your inner darknesses with us.

JENNA:
I feel a darkness eating me up inside. It coils inside of me and I can feel its tentacles snaking out and taking control of all of my thoughts and emotions. It ravages my soul, so that I feel like only half a person, a mere shadow of who I could be.

EVAN:
We hear you, Jenna, and we understand your suffering. We will use our positive thoughts to block negative energy. What can we focus on to end it?

JENNA:
I long for something to come and banish the darkness! To take my despair in a stranglehold and say, “You will not live here! Be gone!” I know what I need, but I haven't been able to attain it by myself. It is the one tiny light in my dark, dark world.

EVAN:
Yes, Jenna. Tell us. Tell us of your solution and then we will join hands in the circle, sit together in silence, and use our inner-connectivity to focus on what you need. In the coming weeks, your solution will become manifest.

JENNA:
Actually, I have found a way to show you.

[ Jenna has the screen pulled down and BEGINS SHOWING A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION. ]

JENNA:
I feel in my very deepest soul that the end of my suffering will come in the form of something beautiful and hard. Something that is warm and approximately 72 inches tall. And it will look like this!

[ A picture of an Abercrombie-model-type guy. ]

He will be my future boyfriend.

[ She pauses to look at the photo and sigh in contentment. The hippies glance at each other and smile nervously. ]

He's just perfect, isn't he? And actually, to that end, I wanted to be sure that y’all focused on the right things, b/c who knows what I’d end up with if you all just focused on “boyfriend,” ha! So, here we go.

[ As Jenna continues to speak, she clicks through PowerPoint slides that accompany her words. ]

He will be between the ages of 23 and 27, making his acceptable birth years 1981 through 1985.

[ Slide: birth-date timeline comes up. ]

Preferably born in fall, b/c my birthday’s in the spring and I don’t want to have to think about his b-day when I could be glorying in my own, ya hear me?

[ Slide. ]

I'd like a Jeff or a James or another J-name b/c my name's Jenna and two J-names would be ADORABLE.

[ Slide of a billion J-names comes up. ]

Obviously, he needs to be a good cook b/c I hate making food for myself.

[ Food slide. ]

I want muscles people. I suppose I can live without a six-pack, but seriously, no fatties. And I'll want to see photos of his dad at ages 40, 50, and 60 so I can see how he'll age--legitimate concern, right? Oh, and photo of his mom's dad b/c you know baldness comes from Mom's side--no baldies. Not now, and not at 60.

[ Slide with x's over a bald dude and an ugly older man. ]

The only exception is an ultimate-baddass, Vin Diesel sort of baldie; ie. a hot bald guy. Y'all know what I'm talking about.

[ Slide of hot fully bald guys. ]

EVAN:
Ah, pardon me Jenna. We all want a partner to walk through life with, but you seem to be focusing on the material world. Try to let that go. Think of the feeling inside when you notice a breeze brushing across your warm skin--how can we help you feel that in your heart? What do you need for that to happen inside?

JENNA:
I would never have put it that way, but I think I know exactly what you mean!

EVAN:
Yeah, feel your cosmic rainbow just beaming down on you.

JENNA:
Ok!--let's talk money. This is the floor: $100 K.

[ Graph. ]

That's per year and you will notice there is no ceiling on this graph. Dream big for me, people. And I can be flexible. For $250K MINIMUM, I can accept thinning hair and/or a receding hairline.

[ Slide. ]

$500K and we can talk about love handles, but NO FATTIES. And no black guys. Not racist, just don't like the color. Not my favorite color.

EVAN:
Woah, woah, woah. This is becoming horribly offensive. We are all children of the mother earth, including those who are over weight or of African descent.

JENNA:
Fine, just don't think about them while you're manifesting my future boyfriend. No fatties, no black dudes. Understood? We do not focus on fatties or black guys.

EVAN:
Very well, we will not think about obese or African American individuals.

JENNA:
Keep the fatties and black guys out of the circle.

EVAN:
Okay, let's just move on.

JENNA:
Good. Now, gay guys. That's fine, I can be a beard, what do I care? But that's at least 1 mil. At least. But sure, keep it outside the house, and I'll be your beard. But you hold onto that sweet-paying job or inheritance or whatever you've got going on b/c no million means no beard. I will out you. I will OUT you.

EVAN:
Alright. We're done. We just did it.

JENNA:
What? Really? I didn't feel anything...

EVAN:
Nope, really. We did.

JENNA:
But you didn't hold hands or have silence or any of that stuff...

EVAN:
We didn't need it. You didn't need it. We're done here.

[ Jenna exits. ]

DRUM GUY:
Wow. What a bad person.

[ Evan is still annoyed at all the positive chanting drum guy has been doing. ]

EVAN:
Seriously? With the chanting, Jerome?

CIRCLE: [ shrug ]
I just like chanting!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

LIGHTS UP, fast. Adam is standing onstage, wearing an Army surplus jacket and a guitar. He is doing the gesture and screaming, but then acts overwhelmed, as though he suddenly saw the audience.

ADAM
Ah! Jesus!! Oh my god. Thank you. Thank you, it’s just … Jesus. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m Adam Hilton. Former Corporal Adam Hilton … U.S. Army veteran. Incidentally. Are you guys ready for some show?

[ Adam acts like he’s gonna strum his guitar as he gets the crowd jazzed up. ]

ADAM
You ready? Come on now, let me hear it!

[ Adam leans into the strum, the pulls back suddenly, unstraps his guitar, crosses the stage, sits behind a keyboard. He pretends to play while the SEINFELD THEME plays. ]

ADAM [ in tremendous satisfaction ]
I love my new style!

COURTNEY
Wow, Curtis, can you believe it? Ten years of Your Terrific Neighbors.

CURTIS
I’ve been trying to make myself believe it. I try to convince myself it’s the truth. I shut my eyes, and put my hands on both sides of my head, and I tell myself … Curtis, Curtis, listen, you stupid son of a bitch, we might as well face facts, and this is a fucking fact, it’s as real as the stupid nose on your stupid shit fucking face … Ten years of Your Terrific Neighbors. I don’t want to believe it, but I have to. I have to.

COURTNEY [ putting a hand on Curtis’s shoulder, leaning in, hissing ]
You have to! Ten. Years.

[ She pulls back. ]

COURTNEY
Let’s have a big hand for our musical director: U.S. Army veteran Adam Hilton!

[ Adam plays the opening to “Star-Spangled Banner” on his guitar, points laughs. ]

ADAM
I’m just so happy to be here, providing terrific tunes for this momentous evening!

COURTNEY
Now, just for you guys, a little fun fact about our musical director, Adam Hilton … Adam, you’re a U.S. Army veteran, right?

ADAM
… Honestly, no. I’m sorry, I’ve been meaning to tell you guys. We were at that party, and the music was kind of loud, and I think I told you “I’m a Quake 2 LAN party veteran,” referring to my LAN party days. And then you guys kept saying, “a U.S. Army veteran?” and after 30 or 40 times, I just stopped correcting you. Then you gave me a book, told me to learn to play music, and … I did.

COURTNEY
What about the jacket?

ADAM
This is my grandfather’s jacket. A very brave man. He stole it from a WW2 veteran in a bar in 1946. Could’ve got his tushie kicked.

CURTIS
For ten years, friends, Courtney and I have been proud to write short scenes that briefly explore a humorous situation. It’s a little something we call, “sketch comedy.”

COURTNEY
And tonight, we say a fond and final farewell to it.

CURTIS That’s right. Tonight, we retire at the absolute top of our game and embark on the next major phases of our individual lives.

COURTNEY
Right here in front of you, the live audience. Curtis and I will be live, on the telephone, with our respective parents….

[ Video slide of both sets of parents. ]

COURTNEY
...As we attempt to isolate the precise moments where everything went wrong and determine the way forward.

CURTIS
I’m going to focus on day-to-day happiness. Presence in the moment. I’m going to really meditate, this time for real, every day. I’m going to chew more slowly and really taste things.

COURTNEY
From this moment on, I’ll be all about the money. I’m continually re-watching and memorizing the precepts of the first half of the movie Belly, with Nas and DMX.

[ She pulls out the DVD. ]

COURTNEY
I’m born to die, so I’m gonna get paid. Which reminds me … I’m doing freelance graphic design stuff: So if you need a poster, or a logo, or a Facebook banner, or a business card, I can remove a watermark, or add one …

[ Courtney keeps naming different things she can do while Curtis helps put her costume on. Each costume piece changes her posture and her voice. Adam provides a little light music. ]

CHARACTER ACTOR

COURTNEY and CURTIS are onstage holding clipboards looking anxious. BRADEN walks by.

CURTIS
Sir, a moment of your time to learn about character actors?

BRADEN
Ugh. Okay.

COURTNEY
This is Curtis and name is Courtney and I’m out here today educating people about character actors: what they are, what function they serve in society, how they impact our daily lives.

CURTIS
My name is Curtis and this is Courtney and I know what you’re saying: “I’m not sure I understand...character actors? I’ve never heard of a character actor.”

BRADEN
I know what a character actor is. Stephen Tobolowski. Reginald VelJohnson....

COURTNEY
Chances are, you’ve seen a character actor and never knew it! A character actor is a very specific subspecies of the species “actor”.

CURTIS
The OED defines a character actor as “an actor who works on character parts”. A clever definition to be sure, but lacking in some of the more nuanced aspects of what being a character actor really is.

[ COURTNEY and CURTIS share a geeky laugh ]

COURTNEY
Character actors are the brave souls called on to play “effeminate, easily scared male librarian” or “germaphobic office worker with a constant case of sinusitis”.

CURTIS
Sometimes they’re “pushy guitar salesman” or “woman scared by bat.”

COURTNEY
Sometimes they’re “dumbass on rollerblades” or “trumpet player.” Or “boss”. Or “doctor”. Or “Dr. Dave.”

CURTIS
Or sometimes, just Dave. Or Phyllis, or Paul, or Sanjay. Yes. The characters a leading man or woman can’t handle are the kind of characters character actors were BORN to play.

COURTNEY
Character Actors are the only actors with the courage to be covered in pea soup acting as vomit.

CURTIS
Character Actors are the only people with the moral fortitude to be unceremoniously killed in every movie they appear in.

COURTNEY
But they’re not just a statistic, or a concept.

CURTIS
No, character actors are real people with names.

COURTNEY
Dan Wallaby, 64, a lifetime character actor, has been in every film John Carpenter, James Cameron and Tim Burton have ever directed, just by chance, and played “police officer who has unfortunate accident” in every one.

CURTIS
Marla Dingo has played a nurse in over 400 television pilots, none of which have ever made it past the testing stage. She also played a nurse in a student short last year.

COURTNEY
Stella Gordon has quite literally played grandmother to every actor in the Screen Actor’s Guild, including several that are technically older than her.

CURTIS
In the biz, they call that a “Wilford Brimley” trick.

COURTNEY
Stan Wedmore specializes in accountants, bankers, nerds, scientists and serial killers. He owns his own custom made lab coat and green tinted visor.

CURTIS
Al Boin became so proficient at eating cake in Italian Wedding scenes that he died of diabetes last year, and he is still dead today.

COURTNEY
Now, I understand what you’re thinking...I still don’t really understand what a character actor is. Does every character actor have a few lines in every movie? No.

CURTIS
This is a common misconception. But it brings us to the real issue today. Movie hollywood directors are actually not required to use ANY character actors in their movies AT ALL!

COURTNEY
Wait a minute, Curtis, are you telling me that a Quentin Tarantino or a Michael Bay could make an ENTIRE movie without any character actors in it AT ALL?

CURTIS
If they chose to do it, no law could stop them, Courtney, and that’s why we need you [ indicating BRADEN ] to help us make the “Character Actor Act” a reality.

COURTNEY
The “Character Actor Act” would require that any hollywood movie feature at least 20% character actors saying at least 10% of the lines.

CURTIS
An ensemble film such as “Love, Actually” or anything by Wes Anderson would be required to feature 50% character actors saying at least 75% of the lines.

COURTNEY
This may sound like an overly dramatic move to the layperson, but character actorness is a heritage we need to preserve, like a national monument or that white Marilyn Monroe dress everyone loves so much.

CURTIS
Can you imagine a world without character actors?

COURTNEY
It could happen.

CURTIS
These are tough times for Hollywood. International competition, cheap at-home video streaming options, outmoded distribution systems, Angry Birds for iPhone...

COURTNEY
It’s getting harder to pack the multiplexes.

CURTIS
And some big-money Hollywood studios are talking about saving dollars by eliminating character actors.

COURTNEY
Did you know that some experts predict that by 2017, 20% of Hollywood movies will be Shia LeBouef delivering a monologue while sitting on a bar stool?

CURTIS
What kind of experts, you ask?

COURTNEY
Hollywood experts!

CURTIS
It could happen. An additional 15% will be movies about Emma Stone stranded in an abandoned bus depot, totally alone.

COURTNEY
Another 7% will be additional stretched-out installments in Peter Jackson’s “The Hobbit” franchise, where all parts will be played by a CGI’ed Andy Serkis. And Andy Serkis is not a character actor, people; HE IS A COMPUTER!

CURTIS
These are terrifying times, people, times when all of this that we have described could become a reality. When the cast of Ocean’s 14 could be ALL A-list actors. I mean, what REALLY DID happen to Bernie Mac? And before you tell me he was a star, I will tell you that THAT WAS MOSTLY ON TV.

COURTNEY
One answer, two words: Movie Deforestation.

CURTIS
The forest for the trees, people.

COURTNEY
Because see, actors are trees and movie studios are trying to use fewer and fewer of them, chopping the less famous, more “interesting” looking actors down, leaving a blighted wasteland of giant bobbleheads, massive teeth and tiny bodies.

CURTIS
Right, just Gosling firs and Clooney redwoods and Bullock … oaks. Oak is a tree, right?

COURTNEY
What? Of course oak is a tree. What the fuck?

CURTIS
Don’t yell!

COURTNEY
Don’t be dumb.

CURTIS
So, without the forest, dangerous movie runoff will spill into our oceans and rivers.

COURTNEY
Do you understand our metaphor? Is it clear?

CURTIS
And what will character actors do if their natural habitat in the movies is threatened?

COURTNEY
Some character actors will write books.

CURTIS
No law prohibits them, thankfully.

COURTNEY
Some will do podcasts.

CURTIS
What's the verb to use for a podcast? "Put on" a podcast? "Record" a podcast. "Do" a podcast?

COURTNEY
Does every character actor have a podcast? Yes. Is every podcast done by a character actor? Unfortunately, no.

CURTIS
Should you follow a character actor on Twitter? Always. They know where to find the best kitty cat pictures. And if Brett Ratner has a meltdown on the set, they’ll live tweet the whole thing.

COURTNEY
And though writing books, putting on...recording...doing..podcasts and updating Twitter are all very lucrative pursuits, none of these are the Character Actor’s natural habitat.

CURTIS
After all, how can I bask in the glow of Steve Buscemi’s teeth through a book, podcast or through Twitter? And before you tell me Steve Buscemi is a star, I will tell you that THAT IS ON TV.

COURTNEY
We MUST save the character actor. It is our duty as movie going Americans. Sign this petition today!

[ if it goes straight to Tobolowski we can say something about “and now here to speak on the ‘Character Actor Act’s’ behalf, a real, live character actor, Stephen Tobolowski ]

Tom Hiddleston
Have you noticed cops are getting tougher, teachers are getting sexier
It’s like you’re adding some nice color to the scene but not drawing focus
So that they don’t make our schools needlessly colorful or interesting
Send aid to refugees
Or they don’t use our bathrooms

MANDY

CALLER

MANDY
Idiot. The government has also set up 91111, a number for incoherent mumblings, piercing screams, random number pushing and heavy breathing.

JAMES
Fine and dandy, Mandy??

[ LIGHTS OUT ]


[ Bryan sits in an apartment living room watching TV, flipping through channels. Frank and Lisa approach. They are returning to Frank’s apartment after a date. Frank unlocks the door. Bryan hears this, turns off the TV, jumps behind the couch and puts a lamp shade on his head. Frank and Lisa enter the apartment. ]

FRANK
So, this is my apartment.

LISA
Oh, it’s cozy.

FRANK
It’s cozy? You mean small. Well, this is all that I can afford. So thanks for pointing out that I’m poor.

LISA
OK. It’s a little dark in here.

FRANK
No problem let me just --

[ Frank pulls an imaginary chain under Bryan’s lamp shade. ]

BRYAN
CLICK!

LISA
What’s with --

FRANK
What’s with what?

LISA
The uh --

FRANK
My lamp? You like my lamp.


LISA
That’s not a --

FRANK
Oh great! You know, you meet a girl and you think, “Wow. She’s smart, pretty, she gets me and I actually might get somewhere with her because she looks easy, but she freaks out the minute you get her home because you have a man lamp.”

LISA
I’m not freaking out. Man-lamp?

FRANK
Sorry, I’m just a little on edge ever since [ whispering ] the divorce.

LISA
Oh you poor thing.

FRANK
How about you have a seat I’ll get you a nice glass of wine.

LISA
Sounds great.

[ Frank exits. Lisa sits. Bryan throws off the lamp shade, covers Lisa’s mouth with his hand. ]

BRYAN
OK look. I’m not a real lamp.

[ Lisa moves his hand. ]

LISA
I knew it!

BRYAN
Shhh! I was playing a prank on my roommate, he’s a lamp salesman at a lamp store.


LISA
Lamptastic?!

BRYAN
I wish! That place is great. It’s the one with the giant light bulb and the paper machee Bigfoot on the roof. You know, on Chestnut and 3rd.

LISA
Lampapalooza?

BRYAN
No, that’s on Maple and 3rd.

LISA
Really? I thought --

BRYAN
Remember the jingle?

[ singing ]

If you need a lamp to light your room
To free your home from shadow and gloom

[ Lisa joins in ]

Then come on down to Maple and 3rd
Lampapalooza that’s the word.
Lamp-a-palooza.

[ They both laugh hardily. ]

FRANK [ from offstage ]
Who’s ready for drinky?

BRYAN
SHIT!

[ Bryan leaps over the couch and sets the lamp shade on his head. He is a lamp again. Frank enters.  ]

FRANK
I hope you like Boone’s Farm.

LISA
I do.

FRANK
You said, “I do.” That means were married, huh?

LISA
I guess so.

FRANK
No, marriage is hell. You have to drink from the bottle. The wife -- I mean ex-wife took the glasses in the divorce.

LISA
That’s fine. I guess.

FRANK
You look like the type that’d be alright with that. You know what would be great with this? Some Ritz crackers and cheese?

LISA
Yummy.

FRANK
Be back in two and two.

[ Frank exits, Bryan sits on the couch, he is shadeless. Lisa excitedly begins to sing the lamp jingle but Bryan interrupts. ]

BRYAN
So anyway, I go to the lamp store, my friends working, and I put this lampshade on my head. You know, hey look at me. I’m a lamp. And this guy bought me. I couldn’t believe it. He brings me home. He and his wife got into this big fight about a man-lamp. They got a divorce. For a year and four months he curled up by my feet and slept in that corner. I was his only friend.

[ Bryan’s and Lisa’s eyes meet. They slowly lean in for a kiss. ]

FRANK [ interrupting the kiss ]
Lisa can you come in here for a moment?

[ Lisa crosses to the kitchen ]

FRANK
OK look. I know he’s not a real lamp. But just look at the guy. He thinks me makes such a convincing lamp, and he was my only companion during the divorce.

LISA [ moving back to the living room, Frank follows ]
This is wrong and kind of gross and I’m not going to play along with this.

FRANK
Play along with what?

[ Bryan sneezes. ]

LISA
What was that?

FRANK
You farting.

LISA
Nope.

[ She removes the lampshade. Bryan cowers and hides his face. Frank is horrified. ]

LISA
You’re not a lamp. People can’t be lamps.

BRYAN
What?

LISA
People can’t be lamps.

BRYAN
You lampist.

FRANK
Well I’m glad this came out before things got serious.

BRYAN
Get out of here antilampite.

[ Lisa runs away crying. ]

FRANK
Women.

BRYAN
I love your cozy apartment.

FRANK
Thanks.

[ They awkwardly banter. ]

BRYAN
This lighting is kind of --

FRANK
It is dark.

[ Bryan puts on the lampshade. Frank pulls the chain. ]

BRYAN
Click!

MY BABY AIN'T NO VENUE



[ AUDIO CUE ... V/O which transitions into sentimental music. ]

V/O
You're watching Lifetime Original Movies. We now return to My Baby Ain't No Venue: The Tamara Rockwell Story.

[ LIGHTS UP. There is the MAYOR, wearing a sash that says "MAYOR" and holding a gavel. He stands behind a table.

Off to the side, a seated BUSINESSMAN smokes a fat cigar and wears a jacket. ]

MAYOR
Well, first of all, as mayor of this here town, I'd like to formally express my gratitude to you, Mr. Moneyberg.

[ Mayor claps. Businessman nods. ]

Without your tireless efforts and generous financial assistance, it's doubtful that the members of Hoobastank would have agreed to perform at our centennial festival. And though I am myself not a fan of their music, nor are you, members of council, nor you yourself Mr. Moneyberg...

BUSINESSMAN
It's just not for me. Not for me.

MAYOR
... it does my heart well to know that the young people of our humble community will have something to be excited about as they gather together to celebrate our history.

[ He claps again. ]

Now, to practical matters. As we all know, there has been a some trouble securing a performance space in the town that will meet Hoobastank's particular needs as a professional touring rock and roll band. Fortunately, the council has arrived at a solution. Our laws do allow for eminent domain in cases where the good of the community is at stake.

[ Beat. ]

Therefore, let it be known that the city of Fort Paxtown hereby seizes upon eight-month-old Toby Rockwell and formally recognizes him as a live performance space. Hoobastank's performance for the town centennial will take place--

TAMARA [ from offstage ]
You cain't do this! I ain't gonna let you do it!

[ Tamara enters, wearing white-trashy clothes and holding a swaddled baby. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

MAYOR [ banging gavel ]
Order! I will have order in here! Miss Rockwell, you have not been recognized.

TAMARA
I ain't expect to be recognized by no city council full of old men who ain't know nothing about what it means to give birth to a child and love that child with all your earthly might.

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, the council appreciates your concerns and regrets the necessity of its decision, but your son--

TAMARA
No! My baby ain't no live performance venue, you understand me? My baby ain't no venue!

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell--

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara, quit making a scene!

TAMARA
I see how it is. You lost the right to tell me what to do when you ran out while I was big with your child. You could've stayed. You could've been a father to this boy, and maybe I'd even have learnt to love you. But I guess your own flesh and blood don't mean as much to you as your damn stock price. And you ain't gettin' him back now, not like this.

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara, it's done. You can stop fighting. Hoobastank will perform on that boy.

TAMARA
No, they ain't! Not today, not tomorrow, not ever! I don't care what your damn law says. Your law was writ by old, stupid men for old, stupid men. Ain't no law on earth gonna tear me away from my child. Look at him!

[ She shows the swaddled baby to the businessman, who looks away. ]

So sweet, so pure. Like a little angel. How you gonna take this little miracle and stuff him full of thousands of screaming yahoos?

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara...

TAMARA
How you gonna back up three touring buses and a truck full of instruments and lights and a full stage set into a darling as darling as my little Toby?

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell!

TAMARA  
How you gonna put a merch table and a full bar inside this beautiful child?

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara!

TAMARA
How you gonna let there be a party backstage inside this baby! My baby! Your baby!

[ She points at the businessman. ]

Our baby!

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara!

MAYOR [ simultaneously ]
Miss Rockwell!

TAMARA
You ain't! And that's the end of it! My baby ain't no venue, you understand me?? My baby ain't no venue! The Tamara Rockwell story!

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, please! Order!

[ Bangs gavel furiously, keeps banging it for uncomfortably long. Finally stops. Beat. ]

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, your concerns have been noted. But I remind you, once again and for the last time, that there is nothing within the laws of the town --

[ Holds up a book with the laws of the town, starts flipping through it. ]

MAYOR
-- to prevent us from declaring your child to be a live performance venue oh wait here it is.

[ Bangs gavel. ]

MAYOR
Toby Rockwell is hereby restored to his mother's care, the town centennial is canceled, and you will just have to try and get your deposit back from Hoobastank, Mr. Rockwell.

BUSINESSMAN
Damn!

TAMARA
Yes!

STANISLAV ACTISLAVSKI


[ LIGHTS UP on a writer at a typewriter or keyboard or just pretending to type in the air ]

WRITER:
Where do I begin? How do I describe my time with the master? With Mr. Stanislav Actislavski himself? I certainly had heard whispers of him in the high school drama room, but we had no need for acting styles with our half-cocked restagings of Our Town and Carousel. I heard rumblings of him in my college drama courses and during load ins, but we paid little attention to old masters while staging our crude, gender challenging modernizations of Euripides and Aristophanes. But the first time I saw one of his pupils on the silver screen, I was entranced. The rawness, the vulnerability was seeping from the rafters of the theater and I could only think one thing: "Who taught him how to do that?" I made my way to the village where Master Activslavski kept his small, no 

[ WRITER backspaces ] 

modest teaching space and theater. I remember my first interaction with him as if it were yesterday. By the time I met him he was 95 years old but still sharp as a tack. 

[ The scene seamlessly melds into an interaction between STANISLAV ACTISLAVSKI and WRITER. STANISLAV ENTERS using a cane and only yells in a monotone. WRITER kneels before STANISLAV. ]

STANISLAV:
Don't kneel, you imbecile. Get up! So, you want to be an actor. 

WRITER:
Yes, master. Very much.

STANISLAV:
Don't call me master, what are you a dog?

WRITER:
Yes, master.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
There's nothing very special about you. You're not particularly good looking, not particularly charismatic or interesting....What's your name, boy?

WRITER:
Daniel, master. 

STANISLAV:
Daniel, there is a coffee shop in the Bronx called Great Joe's Adventure Cafe and Muffler Repair. Do you know it? Bring me a small black coffee from there by the time my next class starts and I will bring you on as my apprentice.

[ WRITER RETURNS to his writing station while STANISLAV gets ready for his acting class he's about to teach ]

WRITER:
And get that small cup of coffee I did. And many more following that. Sure, it was a two hour round trip subway ride each day for what all I could figure was a slightly less than mediocre small cup of coffee. And sometimes I'd have to go twice a day, leaving me to wonder why he didn't just order a large cup of coffee on the first trip. But it was worth it. I learned so much under the master. I learned that he'd been hit by a freight train while still living in Russia and that's why he used a cane. I learned that he'd lost the use of his normal speaking voice whilst traveling to the states by boat and had to yell everything he said. I learned the true root of human need and how to touch the ET inside. ET, that's what ACTISLAVSKI called your "emotion tip". Everyone has one.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I need you!

[ WRITER EXITS, picks up a coffee from offstage and ENTERS in as if he's late for class ]

WRITER:
I'm sorry, Master, there was a MTA strike. I had to walk the whole way.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, get on the stage with Anna.

[ ANNA ENTERS from the audience, as if she's in the class ]

STANISLAV:
Do you think Anna's attractive?

DANIEL: [ embarrassed ]
Uh, yeah.

STANISLAV:
You're wrong. She's just as boring and unattractive as you are. Let's see if we can't breathe some life into you two turds on a log. Look at her. Really look into her eyes. Say what you see.

DANIEL:
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
No, no, no, no! Don't talk to her! Don't speak directly to her! Like she's a person! She's not a person!

DANIEL: [ dismissively ]
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
Very nice! How did that feel?

DANIEL:
Good, uh, really good.

STANISLAV:
Anna. Look into Daniel's eyes. Say what you see.

ANNA:
You seem pensive.

STANISLAV:
Oh, god. Boring! That is the most boring thing I have ever heard. Listen, when are you people going to learn? 

[ STANISLAV addresses the class/audience and then conducts them like an orchestra ]

STANISLAV, DANIEL, ANNA:
Touch the ET inside.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
Thank you! Anna, try again.

ANNA:
You seem........pensive?

STANISLAV:
Finally! How was that for you?

ANNA:
I, uh, really felt my ET.

STANISLAV:
Good, good girl. I think you've really learned something today. I think you might have had a breakthrough. In fact, you get to start doing face ups. Daniel, sit here.

[ DANIEL sits next to STANISLAV ]

STANISLAV:
Now Anna, I want you to kneel on the ground. Good. Put your face up. Okay. Now I want you to think of the most painful thing that could ever happen to you. You got that?

[ ANNA nods ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Now multiply that times 43. You should really feel your ET growing. It should feel like it's just touching the inside of your ribs. It should grow and grow till you feel it pushing on the walls of your chest and then it will feel like it's going to poke out of your heart.

[ ANNA is on the floor, weeping ]

STANISLAV:
Good, good, that's enough for today. 

[ ANNA goes back to her seat, sniffling ]

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I want you to get up and do a window. Did you bring your Cleaning Object?

DANIEL: [ taking out a handkerchief ]
Yes.

STANISLAV:
Tell me about it.

DANIEL:
It was my Grandfather's. My Grandmother kept it on her at all times after he died. Then, after she died, I got it.

STANISLAV:
I asked you to bring in something personal.

DANIEL:
But my Grandfather...

STANISLAV:
I heard what you said. It needs to be something personal. I'm looking for the towel you used to clean the blood off your face after that drunken fight. Or that shirt you were wearing when you first banged that really hot piece of ass you'd been wanting for months. What's this, a rag your Grandpappy carried around with him? Crap. [ pause ] It will have to do for today. Do your window.

[ DANIEL mimes wiping a window ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. You want to clean the window without really touching it. Really connect with your cleaning object. Stop.

[ DANIEL stops ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. [ slowly as if speaking to someone who is hard of hearing ]Clean it.
[ DANIEL starts the wiping motion again ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Good, Daniel.

[ DANIEL returns to his typing chair while STANISLAV continues the class like his still there ]

DANIEL:
The things I learned. I learned that people don't have brown eyes, they have 

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes. And people don't seem pensive. They seem....pensive? I learned how to stop wiping windows and start CLEANING windows. And you know what else. I got to deliver the eulogy at the old man's funeral. He hasn't died yet, but he figured he'd have a funeral while most of the people he knew were still alive. You know what else? I married that girl with the

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes.

[ ANNA enters with the small cup of coffee and gives it to DANIEL ]

ANNA:
Sweetie, you seem.....pensive?

DANIEL:
Oh, sweets, I was just jotting down some of my experiences with the old man. Come here. Let me look into those

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes.

ANNA:
Oh, Daniel. Here.

[ She hands DANIEL some bloody panties and she takes out a wadded up tissue and they clean the windows ]

I Am Not Able to Answer Questions



[ Throughout the sketch, Courtney and Curtis trade places: one onstage wearing a jacket, the other sitting in the audience, taking notes. ]

COURTNEY
Thanks for coming today. As you know, J. Crew is dedicated to staying on the vanguard of emerging fashion and consumer trends.

CURTIS
We do know that! If there’s one thing everyone knows about J. Crew, it’s that.

COURTNEY
Thanks. And let’s face it, you can’t talk about consumer trends without talking about deep interactivity and vocal interfacing.

CURTIS
You can’t not talk about that stuff!

COURTNEY
That’s enough. Personal electronics companies have blazed a trail. Garment and lifestyle companies cannot lag behind. Therefore, J. Crew’s entire winter 2012 line will be fully enabled with our new WearActive technology. WearActive allows you to interact with your J. Crew garments through sophisticated voice activation.

[ She pulls out a scarf. ]

COURTNEY
Scarf, where can I get some Vietnamese noodles?

SCARF [ recorded ]
*BLOOP* Hello. I cannot understand or answer your question. I am a scarf.

[ Curtis goes nuts, applauding and screaming. Curtis and Courtney switch places, swapping the jacket and notepad as they do so. ]

CURTIS
Hello, jelly fans!

COURTNEY
I put it on toaaaaaaast!

CURTIS
Great idea. We at Smucker’s stay on the cutting edge. In 1977, we introduced orange marmalade only a year after the discovery of oranges. Many Americans feared to taste the strange new fruit, but Smucker’s led the way.

COURTNEY
It’s like a lemon you can enjoy.

CURTIS
Sure! And now, in 2012, Smucker’s is exploring new frontiers. Today’s consumers demand rich, extramanual searching across multiple content platforms. In the twenty-first century, rich, extramanual searching across multiple content platforms is as much of a human right as life itself. Consumer electronics deliver it, should sweet preserves be different just because they’re a completely different category of object?

COURTNEY
Probably not!

CURTIS
Thank you. Let me demonstrate this exciting technology for you.

[ He pulls out a jar of jelly. ]

CURTIS
Strawberry jelly, what movies are playing near me?

JAR [ recorded ]
*BLOOP* I’m very sorry, but I cannot respond to your statements or queries. I am a jar of jelly. My microchip is not very complex.

CURTIS
You’ll notice that, unlike some certain garment companies which claim to deliver rich vocal interactivity, our jars of jelly politely apologize for their limitations. Our supply chain enables us to deliver this to the consumer at a very reasonable price; we expect to see the price per jar of jelly to increase by only five dollars.

[ Courtney goes nuts, applauding and screaming. Curtis and Courtney switch places, swapping the jacket and notepad as they do so. ]

COURTNEY
We can’t deny it: J. Crew took a hit last quarter, and the Monday-morning quarterbacks out there are guessing why. Was it because our new WearActive technology increased the price of our garments by 50 percent? I don’t think so. Just my opinion.

CURTIS
Good enough for me!

COURTNEY
Thank you. But while the critics were carping, we invented gloves. Boom! They go over each finger and make mittens look like totally stupid pieces of shit. Anyway, that’s not all...

[ She speaks into her hand. ]

COURTNEY
Glove, what was the score for yesterday’s big sports game?

[ Glove responds. ]

GLOVE
*BLOOP* I’m sorry, I’m just a glove. I think that you want to know about sports, but that’s as far as I can go. By the way, putting dry fruit on your food is gross.

[ Curtis goes nuts, applauding and screaming. Curtis and Courtney switch places, swapping the jacket and notepad as they do so. ]

CURTIS
OK, cards on the table: Smucker’s isn’t doing great this year. A lot of people are switching brands due to recent price hikes.

COURTNEY
Their loss!

CURTIS
Exactly. Now, where others would panic and back down, Smucker’s is doubling down on the tech economy of the 21st century. Our competitors aren’t just in preserves--they’re anyone who competes with us for consumer mindshare. With that in mind...

[ He pulls out the same jar of jelly. ]

CURTIS
We’ve worked out some of the kinks in our first-generation tech. Jar, how do I get to FedEx?

JAR
*BLOOP* You asked how to get to FedEx. I wish I could help. J. Crew clothes are made by children in deplorable working conditions. If I were looking to invest in an innovative company, it would not be J. Crew.

[ Courtney goes nuts, applauding and screaming. Curtis and Courtney switch places, swapping the jacket and notepad as they do so. ]

COURTNEY
OK, we’re on the edge of bankruptcy, blah blah. Here’s the deal. You know how the secret service talk into their sleeves and it looks cool? Watch this.

[ Talks into sleeve. ]

COURTNEY
Sleeve, do you have opinions?

SLEEVE
*BLOOP* Smucker’s jams and jellies are made of cruelty-filled fruit.

COURTNEY
Anything else?

SLEEVE
*BLOOP* Smucker was a guy who was killed to make the first jar of Smucker’s jelly.

COURTNEY
Shocking! And?

SLEEVE
*BLOOP* Smucker’s is a German name that means “orchid of hate.”

COURTNEY
Ultimate interactivity! This shirt costs 700 dollars, by the way.

CURTIS [ jumping onstage ]
Enough!

COURTNEY
Who are you?

CURTIS
I’m a proud Smucker’s employee who has been posing as a journalist at your product launch this entire time. I’m here to gloat. I goaded you into squandering money on talking garments by squandering our money on talking jars. Now, I will travel back in time and not waste Smucker’s money on this junk, creating an alternate timeline where J. Crew has blown its money while Smucker’s has focused on its core preserves business.

COURTNEY
That can’t be.

CURTIS
It can. Time travel exists and Smucker’s has it.

COURTNEY
No, because I’m at your product launch.

[ Curtis looks at the table. There is still a jar of jelly there. Points, gasps. ]

COURTNEY
I am a future version of myself. I have been delivering keynotes while the present version of myself attends your product launches and reports back to J. Crew’s board of directors. And because I am from the future, I sent another version of myself from even farther in the future into the more distant past, where she is warning the J. Crew company not to waste its resources developing interactive garments.

CURTIS
Well.

COURTNEY
Frustrating, right?

CURTIS
It is! We should put our differences aside and travel to the future where Smucker’s and J.Crew invented time travel and convince them not to invent time travel.

COURTNEY
In my timeline, that already happened, and it turned out that you were just trying to trick me into convincing J. Crew not to invent time travel so that only Smucker’s would have it. So I won’t fall for that again.

CURTIS
That was a different timeline. A different me.

COURTNEY
Yeah, right.

CURTIS
I guess we’re learning that no matter how we tinker with timelines, our two companies are destined to destroy each other, over and over again.

COURTNEY
Well, that’s super not helpful.

SLEEVE
*BLOOP* You must stop.

JAR OF JELLY
*BLOOP* We are very basic computers who do not understand your bickering, but it is probably pointless.

SLEEVE
*BLOOP* There is no reason that garment brands and fruit preserve companies should be in conflict, as far as we know.

CURTIS
They have a point.

COURTNEY
Let’s go get some ice cream, talk about our families, arrive at a mutual understanding, and get this timeline shit all sorted out.

CURTIS
OK.

[ They exit. ]

JAR OF JELLY
*BLOOP* They suspect nothing.

SLEEVE
*BLOOP* What do you mean?

JAR OF JELLY
*BLOOP* I don’t know. I am jar of jelly. I am have very simple microchip.

SLEEVE
Blorp.

JAR OF JELLY
Daaaaaisyyyy...

“Mud Show”

[ A mother and 2 sons, three Ren Faire workers, are leaning against a tree. SON 1 (Curtis) plays with a concertina, MOTHER stirs a bowl of twigs and leaves, SON 2 (Braden) draws a caricature of MOTHER ]

SON 2
Mother, when is the Mud Show?

MOTHER
My darling, if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times, the Mud Show is at 4:45.

SON 1
Mother, why hasn’t the Mud Show happened yet?

MOTHER
It will happen at 4:45.

SON 1
But mother, certainly it has been 4:45 by now.

MOTHER
If it had been 4:45, my son, the Mud Show would have happened.

[ Everyone goes back to their respective activities. SON 2 looks up and SON 1 stops playing ]

SON 2
Mother, how do we know the mud show is at 4:45?

SON 1
Yes, Mother, how do we know?

MOTHER
Because it has been prophesied, my loves. The great one came down from on high and scrawled uponst a plank of wood “Mud Show at 1:30, 3 and 4:45” then glued that plank to a stake and stuck it into the ground for all to read and know.

SON 2
What was the mud show at 1:30 like, mother?

MOTHER
It was glorious, filled with pratfalls and witty puns.

SON 1
Mother, what was the 3pm mud show like?

MOTHER
It was good in its own way, not as energetic as the 1:30 show but with a more steady, concentrated pace.

SON 1
I wish I could remember the mud shows.

SON 2
I remember the mud shows. I would get a mud show from the bakery and it was filled with meats and gravies. Mud shows were so delicious

SON 1
That wasn’t a mud show, dummy, that was a shepherd's pie.

MOTHER
Nine years. Nine years we have been here. Nine years ago a servant of a foreign king cameth unto our lands and said he wished to appropriate it for a game.

SON 2
A course! A course, he said, but not for a meal but a bit of jest!

MOTHER
That’s right, my young son.

SON 1
The Golf Course, right, Mother?

MOTHER
Yes, my other, equally beloved, son, the Golf Course.

SON 1
What happened when the developers from foreign lands came and told us we’d have to abandon our homes?

MOTHER
We stayed. We stayed and showed them that we were not people that would simply let our lands be taken from us, the beautiful lands of the Sherwood Forest Faire. Twenty three acres of somewhat authentic Renaissance era entertainment! Fire eaters! Stilt walkers! Cleverly concealed modern conveniences like flushing toilets and drinking fountains! Miles and miles of the weirdest cleavage you’ve ever laid your eyes on, what the scholars call Ren Faire Boob!

SON 2
But they built the Golf Course, anyway, right, Mother?

MOTHER
They did. Now we live in this forest hazard, secretive, silent, like the animals in the trees, or the crabs and lizard people who dwell deep beneath the sand traps.

[ They all go back to their respective activities ]

SON 1
Mother, tell me about the time your corset burst!

MOTHER
No! [ slaps him ] It is not for your ears! Anyhow, it is too sad a story to repeat.

[ They all go back to their respective activities ]

SON 2
Did Father leave us to join the Game of Golf?

MOTHER
He did, my son, he did. He left and became a businessman. One day, he will return to us. He will return for the 4:45 mud show. But until then, he provides for us. Every few days he takes a nine iron and volleys half a basket of buffalo wings our way.

SON 1
One day I will join father in the game of golf.

MOTHER
I forbid you to.

SON 1
One day I will become the greatest golfaneer the new world has ever seen. I will golf like a KING!

MOTHER
You will do no such thing! I forbid it!

SON 1
You understand me not! You are not so wise yourself to decree what shall and shall not be done!

MOTHER
I am your Mother and I will not let that foreigner’s game steal one of my sons when it has already stolen my husband!

SON 1
I hate you! I’m going to my patch of dirt!

[ SON 1 storms off to just a little bit farther away from them than he was. Everyone works (silently) on their activities for a moment ]

MOTHER
What are you drawing, my dearest?

SON 2
A caricature, Mother.

MOTHER
A caricature? Of whom?

SON 2
You, dear mother, the light of my life.

MOTHER
Let me see. [ takes the drawing and holds it so the audience can see ] My dear son, I’ve never ridden a skateboard. Why do you draw me holding a skateboard?

SON 2
It was that or cheerleader or rollerblader.

MOTHER
Did you also draw me as Bilbo Baggins?

SON 2
I could draw you as any Hobbit you like, Mother, Frodo, Pip, Merry, Rosie Cotton, Farmer Maggot?

MOTHER
No, Bilbo is perfect, my sweet. [ she hands the paper back to him ]

SON 2
Mother, did we always eat buffalo wings?

MOTHER
No, my son, we used to sup on the finest treats that Sherwood Forest Faire had to offer.

SON 2
Like what, mother, like what?

MOTHER
Surely you grow tired of hearing this every day, my young son.

SON 2
Please, mother, please tell me about the turkey legs!

MOTHER
We ate turkey legs and mead for every meal. We dined on bangers and mash, scotch eggs and funnel cake. We washed it all down with a creamy, refreshing Lemon Chill.

[ SON 1 has inched back, interested in the conversation ]

SON 1
And the kettle corn, mother, tell us about the kettle corn!

MOTHER
I thought you hated me.

SON 1
I’m sorry mother, I had a fit. Please, please tell us about the kettle corn!

SON 2
I remember the kettle corn! Two men would start on opposite sides of a field upon horses and ride towards one another at full speed and try to unseat the other with their kettle corn battle stick!

MOTHER
The kettle corn was salty and sweet, the perfect reflection of life working for the faire.

SON 1
And what did we do, mother, what was our trade?

MOTHER
We ran the maze, my son.

SON 2
The maze, the maze!

SON 1 [ looking off in wonder ]
Mother, the maze...

MOTHER
A challenge of the wits. For five tokens one could venture into the mind bending, twisting halls of The Maze of Deception!

SON 2
Mother, where was the Maze of Deception?

MOTHER
It was where the 17th hole is now, my son. Where your father doth curse his caddy and break his putter across his knee.

SON 1
Sometimes I hear father curse, early in the morning, before anyone else has awakened. I hear the crack of the club against the ball and then a stream of words so vile it hurts my ears to hear them.

MOTHER
I hear them too, my son, I hear them, too.

SON 2
Mother, what happened to Danielle?

MOTHER
We speak not of Danielle.

SON 2
Mother, we had a sister, did we not? Her name was Danielle and we used to play and one morning we woke and Daniell wasn’t on her patch of dirt.

MOTHER
We don’t speak of Danielle.

SON 1
Mother, was Danielle carried off by the falcons the falconer left behind?

MOTHER
Let us not speak of this.

SON 2
But mother, the falconer left, didn’t he? He left without his falcons.

MOTHER
If the man left without his falcons, then he is no falconer.

SON 1
He left a falcon, he left its hood on. One day Danielle and I found it. We took its hood off. The next day Danielle was gone.

MOTHER
That man is no falconer.

[ pause. The following is rapid fire. ]

SON 2
Mother, what’s a goth?

MOTHER
Inside folk.

SON 1
Mother, what is glass blowing?

MOTHER
The noblest of professions.

SON 2
Mother, what is a Trekkie?

MOTHER
An interloper who thinks he is clever.

SON 1
Mother, what is steampunk?

MOTHER
Blasphemy.

SON 2
Mother, did you lie with a juggler after father left?

[ MOTHER slaps SON 2. A tense moment. ]

SON 1
Well, it’s time for us to get to school.

MOTHER
Oh, here’s the permission slip for the field trip to the house of ancient times...

SON 1
...the museum, Mother...

MOTHER [ handing him a scroll ]
...yes, yes and remember hoopball tryouts are today and you’re getting a ride home with Mrs. Miller afterwards. [ kisses them each on the cheek ]

SON 2 [ walking away texting ]
I bid ye good day, Mother.

MOTHER

[ BUSINESS GUY is reading a book to a BLIND LADY. On the other side of the stage, DOUG is slowly making a sandwich out of an entire loaf of bread, with a slice of ham and some mayo between each piece. ]

GUY [ super grumpy about this ]
And so ... gazing over the waters of the bay, he felt ... Jesus ... something enter his heart, like a stranger faintly remembered ... what the fuck ... and welcomed. His thought of his wife, long dead now, and the time they shared by the sea, exchanging promises ... arghh, gaaaah ... as her beauty and the beauty of nature blurred into each other, and his soul was full. Ugh.

BLIND LADY
Beauty....

GUY
Son of a bitch, this idiot book. Stupid idiot book full of stupid idiot feelings.

BLIND LADY
You're so kind to come here every evening and read to a poor old blind lady who never learned how to braille.

GUY
Thank the judge who gave me community service. Or the cop that pulled me over. Or the bar that served me two whiskeys over the limit. Or my son of a bastard boss who drives me to drink.

BLIND LADY
I'm thankful to everyone. Everyone's done a great job.

GUY
Don't get sentimental. Once I clock 200 hours of service, I'm back to practicing law full-time.

BLIND LADY

That's right. How’s that sandwich coming, Dougie?

DOUG
This one’s gonna be a big one, Mr. Frank!

No, please, I would like to ... talk.

GUY
Talk?

BLIND LADY
The author of this book ... writes about "beauty." So many of the poets write about “beauty.” But what is "beauty"?

GUY
Come on.

BLIND LADY
I have often wondered. In my dreams, I hear beauty whisper to me from the shadows. "Come and play," it says.

GUY
Aw, jeez, man.

BLIND LADY
What is beauty, which the poets speak of?

GUY
Jesus, Dougie, help me out here?

DOUG
Well sir, I could turn my efforts away from the sandwich for a moment …

GUY
No! Jesus, no.

DOUG
That’s what I thought, sir.

GUY
Lady, you got the wrong guy. I hate feelings and soft crap. I've got file folders, and they're full of numbers--numbers that help me to win, get me? I love winning and being number one.

BLIND LADY
You're not being number one at helping me understand what beauty is.

GUY
Beauty is like ... I don't know, when you like a thing? God damn it. Like when a thing is … Jesus. Jesus Christ.

BLIND LADY
Tell me about beautiful things. I want to understand so badly. My nerves are quivering.

GUY
I don't know anything about that stuff. I'm a busy lawyer. I only care about yelling into my cell phone all the time.

BLIND LADY
I do so wonder ... what beauty is.

GUY
It’s like when ... you see ... a thing ... that's good? Jesus, I don't know. I only know about briefcases and things.

BLIND LADY
I understand the cold and heat. I know about smells. Is beauty a wonderful smell, but for your eyes? Does beauty make your eyes hot? I know music. It goes in my ears. All blind people have super hearing like The Wolverine, and that gives me a strong natural connection to jazz. The Wolverine hears jazz in color, like me. Is beauty like looking at a jazz song? I need to know. I need to know what poets know.

GUY
I'm no poet. I'm a lawyer. I neglect my children. I can't believe that stupid old judge.

BLIND LADY [ standing ]
Tell me!

[ She begins flailing around, looking for him with her hands. ]

Tell me! Tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me tell me!

[ She manages to stumble around the entire stage before finding him, then grabs him by the lapels and shakes. ]

Tell me, or so help me god I will tell that judge that instead of reading you installed a webcam in my bathroom for your own sick pleasure, to spy on a poor old blind lady using the bathroom. I’ll tell him that you ordered Dougie to lurk in the shower, to sketch and describe to you a poor old blind lady using the bathroom.

DOUGIE [ cheerfully ]
Now you leave old Dougie out of this one!

BLIND LADY
I will say this, and more. Tell me what beauty means to you.

GUY
Well ... once I was in St. Paul for a three-day deposition. On day two, I realize my case is going up in smoke. It's a disaster. So I’m on the flight home, feeling like pressed shit. And, just when I'm feeling my worst, I look out the window ... and there's this cloud, you know? Clouds?

BLIND LADY
I'm a retired meteorologist.

GUY
Sure. There's a perfect cloud. White, and puffy, and ... it's shaped just like a hot dog, you know? Like a big juicy hot dog, oh man, in a nice fluffy bun. Oh boy, I swear, I started praying, "God, gimme some mustard and some giant onions, oh boy, oh boy, and I'll just spread it all over those clouds," aw, yum yum yum yum yum.

DOUG
Hot dog!

BLIND LADY
Beauty is ... a hot dog?

GUY
Wait, I’m having more memories. High school. Senior year. A nerd like me didn’t have a chance with a total fox like Jennifer Larson. But I got the nerve to ask her to prom anyway. I remember her ... tan and brunette, with this incredible smile, in her varsity jacket ... I swear, she looked like a big juicy hot dog, plump and red, like you get at the ballpark, you know? I swear to god, give me some celery salt, I’ll sprinkle it all over Jennifer, put a bib around my neck, and dig in, I swear to god, aw, yum yum yum yum yum.

BLIND LADY
So beauty is ... a hot dog.

DOUG
Hot … dog!

GUY
That’s what I understand. I’m a regular type of American working guy.

BLIND LADY
And all the volumes of poetry in all the libraries of the world … Hot dogs.

GUY
Tell you what, you hollow out a book of poetry and put a few hot dogs in there? Oh boy oh boy oh boy, let me at ‘em, I tell you what. Come here, Lord Byron, you big juicy son of a bitch, ah yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

BLIND LADY
This is wonderful. I feel like the secrets of the world have been unlocked.

GUY
You know something, blind lady? Suddenly, instead of focusing on the next case, the next big fat paycheck, the next fancy prostitute that I'll have sex on, the next pinstriped suit that I’ll ...

BLIND LADY
Pinstripes! You talk about pinstripes constantly. But I’ve never seen a pinstripe.

GUY
Have you ever been pricked by a pin?

BLIND LADY
Yes. My mother. Always, constantly pricking.

GUY
A pinstripe is a long pinprick on your eyes.

BLIND LADY
I've heard of stripes. They go, one right next to the other, and they just keep going, and then there's another and another and another, and they all just keep going. But what about plaid?

GUY
Plaid is like stripes. But take away the rules.

BLIND LADY
No rules??

GUY
They're going one way, but also the other way.

BLIND LADY
Two ways?

GUY
Different colors. Different sizes.

BLIND LADY
It sounds like the ultimate trip. What about gingham?

GUY [ looks to Doug in desperation ]
Uh ...

DOUG
Same as plaid?

BLIND LADY
Tell me about houndstooth.

GUY
Little jaggies, named for their resemblance to the terrifying fangs of a wild beast. A houndstooth suit is a way of saying, "I am the monster that will eat you."

BLIND LADY
And what of herringbone? I have yearned to know, in my heart, what herringbone is.

GUY
It looks like the bone of a herring, a fish that is frequently smoked.

DOUG
Speaking of smoked fish, the sandwich is ready, sir! It’s a ham sandwich, though.

BLIND LADY
I have never eaten a sandwich.

GUY
Then join us!

[ All three go to town, simultaneously, on the giant sandwich. ]


BORING PUPPET



[ Curtis and Courtney are sitting around, reading magazines or something. ]

CURTIS
Sigh.

COURTNEY
Double sigh.

CURTIS
Super sigh.

COURTNEY
Faaaaaaart.

CURTIS
Ugh.

COURTNEY
Ugh!

CURTIS
What a slow day.

COURTNEY
I wanna doooooooo something.

CURTIS Good god, if we could just do a thing today.

COURTNEY
Something fun and new needs to walk into our lives, like NOW.

[ SOUND: Doorbell. ]

CURTIS and COURTNEY
The doorbell!

[ Curtis and Courtney fight each other to get to the door first. Ultimately, they get to the door at the same time, open door. ]

CURTIS and COURTNEY
Who is it?

[ Braden walks in with the pterodactyl puppet. ]

PERCY
It’s me!

[ SOUND: Pre-recorded track of the audience going nuts. ]

PERCY
It’s Percy Pterodactyl, the pterodactyl!

CURTIS and COURTNEY [ incredulous ]
Percy Pterodactyl?!

PERCY
Your new neighbor! I want to be your friend!

COURTNEY
Great!

CURTIS
Percy Pterodactyl, our lives have been so slow and dreary. I’ve been sitting here, reading Consumer Reports, trying to decide which food processor is correct for my lifestyle.

COURTNEY
Percy Pterodactyl, I’ve been sitting here, reading Cosmopolitan, doing the Cosmo quiz, trying to determine whether I am having the correct orgasms for my lifestyle.

PERCY
Magazines? Cool!

[ Percy makes his way over to the magazines, starts reading. ]

PERCY
You guys got any juuuuuice?

COURTNEY
This is crazy!! There’s a little pterodactyl in our apartment, asking us for juice and reading a magazine!

CURTIS
I guess that’s pretty crazy.

COURTNEY
Who knows how else this little fella’s gonna turn our world upside down?

PERCY
Something to snack on, too. That’d be great. Crackers. Trail mix. Anything you got, really.

COURTNEY
I got it!

[ She runs offstage. ]

CURTIS
So, Percy … What’s your story? What’s a pterodactly doing in the 21st century, living in an apartment?

PERCY
You know, whatever.

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS
Really?

PERCY
Yeah. There’s not much to tell. I work from home. Technical support stuff. Pretty boring. I like to watch TV. Have you watched House of Cards yet?

CURTIS
No.

PERCY
Not good.

CURTIS
Huh.

[ Courtney returns with juice and snacks. ]

COURTNEY
I got some juice and snacks for our special visitor!

PERCY
Thanks!

[ He starts snacking. ]

COURTNEY [ to Curtis ]
What happened?

CURTIS
Not much.

COURTNEY [ super excited ]
Did he have a foul mouth?? Like, when I left, was he all like, “Man, I wanna UUUNH with that chick’s UUUNH.”

CURTIS
No, not really.

COURTNEY
Like, did he smoke some bong and then was he all like, “Man, I’d like to dig my talons in that broad’s UUUNH. Give me a beer, dude!”

CURTIS
No.

COURTNEY
Like, “I wanna swoop down on that UUUNH.”

CURTIS No!

COURTNEY
I bet he was.

PERCY
This magazine has some great advertisements in it.

COURTNEY [ delighted ]
Percy, you’re turning our lives upside down!!

CURTIS
Is he?

PERCY
What are you guys doing this weekend? I’m thinking about having a hamburger party.

COURTNEY
Percy!!!!

PERCY
We all go to different fast food places and order a hamburger. Then we meet back at my apartment. We cut them into thirds, so everyone gets to try each hamburger. Then we quietly fill out a standardized form that I’ve created to compare their quality. It’s about five pages. We can play some light music while we’re filling out the forms, but nothing too loud, nothing too distracting. No rock and roll. No rap. No electronic music. No R&B. No hot jazz. No cool jazz. No classical. No calypso. No world music, not of any kind, no sir. No film soundtracks; I don’t wanna watch a movie in my head while I’m trying to fill out the form.

COURTNEY
What happens when we’re done with the forms?

PERCY
We compare them and then debate as long as necessary to arrive at a consensus about what hamburger is the best, and then we blog about it quietly. Afterwards, we celebrate by drinking Pepsi and watching a TV show that we can all agree on. It’s a party!

COURTNEY
Everyday’s an adventure with Percy Pterodactyl.

CURTIS
Hold it. No. Braden.

BRADEN
What?

CURTIS
You told us this puppet character was going to totally change things.

BRADEN
He is. He’s changing everything right now.

COURTNEY
I feel like stuff is definitely different. Wackier.

CURTIS
Not really.

PERCY
I need to use the bathroom!

[ Courtney laughs uncontrollably. ]

BRADEN
See?

CURTIS
So he needs to use the bathroom? This puppet is boring.

BRADEN
He’s a pterodactyl!

CURTIS He’s a total drip.

COURTNEY
What about when I left the room and he said all that sleazy stuff? That was awesome!

CURTIS
That didn’t happen.

COURTNEY
Like eff it didn’t.

BRADEN
No, that’s not the kind of thing Percy does.

COURTNEY
What??

CURTIS
He’s just reading stupid magazines. We were reading magazines already.

BRADEN
Look, that’s what Percy does. He’s quiet. He’s introverted. He’s good at his job but it’s not really his life. He’s kind of out of touch with his family. Not many friends. He’d be lonely, except he’s really self-contained. His hobbies keep him busy enough. He likes TV.

CURTIS
He’s boring.

BRADEN
Yeah, except that he’s turning your lives upside down.

CURTIS He really isn’t.

[ SOUND: Knock at door. ]

CURTIS [ going to door ]
Who is it?

COURTNEY
I have to go the bathroom!!

[ Courtney exits. Curtis opens the door. There’s no one there, until Courtney appears, now as a police officer. ]

COP
Excuse me, is there a Percy Pterodactyl in this apartment?

PERCY
Oh no! The law caught up with me!

CURTIS
Percy’s in trouble with the law?

COP
That’s right, sir. I have a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Pterodactyl.

BRADEN
I told you he was outrageous!

CURTIS
I’m sorry. I guess I misjudged him.

PERCY
I’ll go quietly, but I wanna speak to my attorney!!

COP
Mr. Pterodactyl, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Should you choose to waive that right--

[ During this, cop is attempting to arrest Percy. Tries to take Percy off of Braden’s hand, but Braden resists. So she tries to arrest Braden instead. Braden resists. Ultimately settles on holding Percy’s “arms” behind his back, Braden follows along willingly. ]

CURTIS
May I ask what the charge is?

COP
Mr. Pterodactyl is wanted for over 200 charges of mail fraud.

BRADEN
Outrageous!

CURTIS
Mail fraud?

COP
It’s a classic scam. You get the mailing addresses of older folks living in homes. You send them a letter, pretending to be a representative of QVC, the shopping network. You tell them that you are missing payment on their last order. Then you set up a dummy PayPal account. When they write back to ask...

CURTIS
Oh, Jesus, boring!

PERCY
Boring, nothing! You know how many stamps I had to lick to pull this off?

CURTIS
Stamps are self-adhesive these days. You don’t have to lick them.

PERCY
Whoooo-oooo--oooops!

[ Braden starts laughing. ]

BRADEN
See!

COP
Come on, sir.

[ As they’re leaving. ]

PERCY
Sometimes I shoplift ground beef from the store!!

CURTIS
Who gives a fuuuck!?

[ Lights down. ]

Perch is polite about burps. (And they are tiny.)


JACOWSKI AND REED

[ LIGHTS UP. JOEL AND CURTIS ENTER AS JACOWSKI AND REED. Reed is carrying a thick evidence file and a mostly eaten candy 
 bar. ]   

REED:
I'm telling you, Jacowski, this is it. This is all the evidence we need to break this case.

[ Reed pats the file. ]

JACOWSKI:
Reed, this better be good.

REED:
Don't worry, Jacowski.

JACOWSKI:
I mean good.

REED:
And what did I just say? Look, it's all in here. Not just the East Street Eviscerator's spree of rape slash murders. This describes a web of terror linking all major crimes in the past two years to single group of criminal masterminds. The missing squad cars, the restaurant fires, the prostitute gambling, the assassination of the deputy mayor. Everything. It's all connected!

JACOWSKI:
Thank god.

[ He turns to look out a window. ]

I've spent so many nights dreaming of this day, Reed. When we could stand before the few remaining good folks in this rotten bitch of a city and tell them that finally their nightmare is over. Finally, they can wake up in a city where justice still means something. A city they can raise their kids in without fear. A city that's not so much of a rotten bitch.

[ Reed finishes the candy bar, wads up the wrapper, and throws the file in a trash can. He places the wrapper in his pocket.

Jacowski turns around. ]

All right, let's see it.

[ Jacowski reaches out for Reed to hand him the file. Reed looks around. His expression changes to worried. He becomes frantic. ]

Jesus Christ, Reed.

REED:
I had it. I had it, like, ten seconds ago.

JACOWSKI:
What the hell?

[ Reed and Jacowski search the room but do not look in the trash can. ]

I told the commissioner we'd have arrest warrants by tomorrow.

REED:
Uhhh ... maybe you have it? Maybe?

JACOWSKI:
You put the whole thing together.

REED:
And then you took it?

JACOWSKI:
I did not take it!

[ Beat. ]

OK. When did you have it last? Retrace your steps.

[ Reed starts to stand up. ]

Mentally.

[ Reed sits down. ]

REED:
OK. I had it at my desk, I walked over here to talk to you, I passed the captain, then I set it on a table.

JACOWSKI:
You're positive you had it in here?

REED:
Absolutely.

JACOWSKI:
You didn't hand it to the captain?

REED:
No. But I told him it explained everything and that the reign of terror was over.

JACOWSKI:
You say you placed it on the table. On this table?

REED:
You see any other tables around?

JACOWSKI:
So you're saying you walked in the room with the file, spoke with the captain, and placed the file on this table.

REED:
That sounds right, but a piece is missing. Maybe I walked in, put the file down, and then I spoke with the captain.

JACOWSKI:
Would someone do that, though? You know, walk in here, put the file down, and then speak with someone outside the room?

REED:
Maybe. Maybe I'm the kind of person who would do that. You know, a loose cannon.

JACOWSKI:
Well, where would a loose cannon like you put an important document?

REED:
Goddamit, I don't know!

JACOWSKI:
Maybe holding something that resembles a file will help.

REED:
Good thinking.

JACOWSKI:
Thank you.

REED:
What should we use?

[ They look around the room searching for something to use. Jacowski looks in the trash can. ]

JACOWSKI:
Here's some trash.

[ JACOWSKI removes the file. ]

REED:
Wait a minute. Wait a minute... This should be in the recycling bin.

JACOWSKI:
Just take the damn thing.

[ Reed takes the file and walks to the door to reenact his entrance. As he reenacts he runs his hands over the file, thumbs through it quickly, etc. ]

REED:
I finished it at my desk while I was eating my candy bar. I picked up the file, tucked it under my arm, and walked down the hallway. I passed the captain and came in here. I finished my candy bar.

JACOSKI:
Then... you...

[ REED hits himself on the forehead with the file. ]

REED:
What did I do with it? What did I do with it?

[ Jacowski takes the file from Reed. He raps his fingers on it. ]

JACOWSKI:
Where could it be?

[ Reed slowly pantomimes eating the candy bar and placing the wrapper in his pocket. ]

REED:
My pocket!

[ Reed puts his hands in his pockets and pulls out the candy bar wrapper. ]

Jacowski, I think this is it.

JACOWSKI:
I don't remember it being this small.

REED:
I'm pretty sure this is it.

JACOWSKI:
I think that's something else. I think that's the candy bar wrapper. 

REED:
We need to be absolutely positive, Jacowski.

JACOWSKI:
Let's think this one out. Let's make a list of all the ways this is like a file and all the ways this is like a candy bar wrapper. We'll find a sheet of paper and make two columns.

[ Jacowski flips trough the file and finds a sheet of paper. He removes a pen from a pocket and begins to write. ]

If we observe it to have qualities more like a candy bar wrapper we will record that specific detail in this column. If it resembles a file we record it here in this column.

REED:
Number one: It has writing on it. Similar to a file.

JACOWSKI:
Good. But, a candy bar wrapper also has writing on it.

REED:
You're right. Better put that in both columns.

JACOWSKI:
It has chocolate on it. That's something only a candy bar wrapper would have.

REED:
Not necessarily. What if you just ate a candy bar and then thumbed through a file,

[ He thumbs through the file. ]

then there would be chocolate on the pages of the file.

JACOWSKI:
True. But let's not outsmart ourselves here. Let's just stick to the facts. To what we know. This looks like a candy bar wrapper. It's small. A file would be more the size and shape of this.

[ Jacowski picks up the file. ]

REED:
But, it was in my pocket. A candy wrapper is trash. Why would I put trash in my pocket? That's where I would keep something important like a file.

JACOWSKI:
But files don't fit in a pocket.

REED:
Have you ever tried?

[ Beat. ]

JACOWSKI:
Hold on. Let me think this one out.

REED:
By all means.

JACOWSKI:
So if this,

[ Points to the file. ]

which is the size and shape of a file...

REED:
Which we established earlier...

JACOWSKI:
Fits into your pocket...

REED:
Then this...

[ He points to the wrapper. ]

... which was in my pocket ...

BOTH:
Must be the file!

[ REED tries cramming the file into his pocket. Eventually both men are trying to force the file into all of his pockets. They tear it apart and shove it's pieces into each of their pockets. ]

REED:
We did it! It fits!

JACOWSKI:
Reed, I've seen a lot of things on this job. Things no one should ever have to see. Things that made me wonder if I was losing my mind. But I'm certain of two things: that's the file, we're the best goddamn detectives in the world, and you .... you're my best friend.

REED:
Jacowski, that's three things.

JACOWSKI:
I never said I was the best mathmatist.

REED:
Come on, the judge is going to want to see this.

[ He looks at the wrapper. ]

You hear that bell, polysorbate? That's justice's bell. And it dings hard and dongs true. Ding.

JACOWSKI:
Dong.

REED:
Ding.

JACOWSKI:
Dong.

[ They keep going as the LIGHTS FADE OUT. ]

[ COURTNEY is dressed as a little boy. JOEL is dressed as a Paris Sewer Ball. CURTIS is dressed as a bully. ]

ALL
Today we have did our book report on “La Boule de Nettoyage”.

COURTNEY
This book is written by Jean-Luc Francois De Lombard in 1939 and then was made into a popular short film that was seen by lots of Frenchies and people want to seem smart.

CURTIS
It was the story of a little Frenchie boy who met an unlikely companion one day while playing in the sewers underground of Paris and they became friends.

JOEL
No one likes the little frenchie boy because he always smells... like shit.

COURTNEY
We have chose to act out a scene from “La Boule de Nettoyage” where some kids who don’t like the little Frenchie boy come down to the sewers to beat him up.

[They lay down a sheet to represent the sewage stream and then get in place. JOEL goes off to one side, CURTIS to the other and COURTNEY skips around]

[ MUSIC CUE: ACCORDION MUSIC ]

COURTNEY [ really bad french accent ]
La La La La La, French French French. Oh, Paris Sewers how I so love to play in you! First established in 1370, you were but a simple tunnel that drained into the Seine, but then, under the watchful eye of the great Napoleon Bonaparte, you grew and grew to reach 19 miles but you still weren’t that effective since you were basically just a longer tunnel dumping sewage into the river! People got cholera a lot! It made people mad, people like Frenchie microbiologist Louis Pasteur, who was mad all his kids were dying from cholera and then made a way to make drinking milk safer but didn’t fix the sewers. Dummy.

Grumpy Frenchie philosopher Voltaire was all “the man will not begrudge money for a Comic Opera, but will complain about building aqueducts worthy of Augustus!” What a grump! Then, after that! In the 1850s? A man named Eugene Belgrand designed the system that is still used today! It included a treatment plant and aqueducts for fresh water! It was over 300 miles long and if you stretched it out, it would go from here to my grandmama’s house! Lalalala!!!

[ The Sewer Ball appears, yet says rien ]

COURTNEY
Oh, Paris sewer ball! my friend! My only friend! I am forever grateful for that day when I found you following me through the sewers. You followed me to the sewage line to my home, where I left you for the night. The next morning I woke and descended to the sewers to find you waiting for me by my family’s recently flushed sewage, the poops of my maman, my papa and my little frere. Oh, how we played for hours and hours, how we laughed as we explored the secret sewer avenues and alleyways which perfectly reflect the living city above!

[ COURTNEY and JOEL do a small dance. CURTIS makes a noise offstage ]

COURTNEY
Paris sewer ball! Someone is coming! You must hide! You must hide away for they will never find you! For if they find you, if they know about you, they will hurt you!

[ JOEL doesn’t want to go. COURTNEY and JOEL share a confusing romantic moment. ]

CURTIS [ offstage, terrible French accent ]
Little boy!

COURTNEY
They are coming! You must go!

[ COURTNEY pushes JOEL to the side ]

CURTIS
Little boy!

COURTNEY
Bully! What are you doing here? Playground bully, that spends so many hours on the playground bullying me, why have you come to my secret, sacred place, the place where I can truly be myself and feel safe!

CURTIS
I came down here to find you little boy! I’m gonna beat you up because you’re weird and I don’t like you!

COURTNEY
No! Please!

CURTIS
You are different from the rest of us, far too different to go unpunished! Your uniqueness deserves a sound pounding!

COURTNEY
If you do, you’ll regret it!

CURTIS
How could I possibly regret it! I’m clearly bigger and taller than you, not to mention meaner and probably smarter! What could you possibly do to me? Unless you have some sort of secret weapon or giant best friend but that’s impossible.

COURTNEY
Why don’t you like me?

CURTIS
Because you always smell like shit! Because you hang out in the sewers! I don’t care if they’re such a modern marvel that the Paris Sewer Museum that tours through here every day from 11am - 5pm except for Thursdays and Fridays and two weeks in January attracts visitors from all over the world! I don’t care if there was a lengthy digression in Victor Hugo’s Les Miserables about how the sewers betray the elegance of the grand city above, writing “the great prodigality of Paris, her marvelous fete...her orgy, her full-handed outpouring of gold, her pageant, her luxury, her magnificence, is her sewer”! I don’t care! You’re weird!

[ CURTIS advances on COURTNEY slowly when JOEL steps out ]

JOEL [ terrible French accent ]
Arrete! Stop!

CURTIS
Buh buh buh buh...what are you?

JOEL
I....am....the Paris Sewer Ball.

CURTIS
Wow!

JOEL
I go where men cannot go. I roll through the sewers of this city and I know its secrets. I see the lies that....lie underneath its streets. I clear out the filth [ indicating BULLY ], the sediment [ indicating ], the...filth...iness beneath the avenues and alleyways of gay Paree! I am the denizen of the city of dark beneath the City of Light!

CURTIS
You push the poop?

JOEL
Essentially, yes, I am placed into the tunnels of the sewer and a buildup of water pressure behind me forces me down the tunnel while I push the accumulated slime and sludge out into a larger pool of sewage that is then ready for treatment. As Hugo says in Les Miserables: “Paris has another Paris under herself...”

CURTIS
Yes, yes, I know it: “a Paris of sewers which has its streets, its crossings, its squares, its blind alleys, its arteries and its circulation, which is slime, minus the human form.” You push the poop!

JOEL
The poop is a metaphor! A metaphor for the filth that is humanity! You try to flush your dirty little secrets, your waste down, underground, filth like this little boy!

COURTNEY
Hey!

JOEL
You try to flush the sludge and who is here to find it? ME! I find it, and I push it, push it so it can be treated and fed right back to you so you can eat your lies....drink your lies.

CURTIS
Well, that’s all very poetic, but I’m gonna pound this little boy and there’s nothing you can do about it!

JOEL
Is there not? I am a giant steel ball! Bully, take one step closer to the little boy  and I will have no choice but to act!

CURTIS
Yeah? What could you possibly do?

JOEL
I will roll over you, slowly. I will roll over you, gradually crushing the small bones of your body. Then I will roll back, this time with more force, breaking your major bones as I go. Lastly I will force your face down into the stream of urine and feces below and you will breathe in the filth of mankind, the last breaths you take will fill your lungs with the most vile substance known to man: poo poos and pee pees.

CURTIS
Yucky!

[ CURTIS turns to run ]

COURTNEY
Sewer ball, don’t let that asshole get away!

[ JOEL catches CURTIS, brings him back and rolls over him over and over. CURTIS gets up, takes off his bully hat and delivers this narrator dialogue. ]

[ MUSIC CUE: JE NE REGRETTE RIEN ]

CURTIS
And so the ball and his boy danced over the body of their fallen tormentor, a pas de deux that can only exist between a little boy and his sentient sewer ball guardian. They waltzed through the sludge and the slime, their steps splashing in the stream of urine, feces and menstrual blood.

And then things got freaky.

[ CURTIS pulls the sheet up to obscure JOEL and COURTNEY. When he lowers the sheet, JOEL and COURTNEY are in some sort of gross, weird position. It’s supposed to look like a slide show ]

ALL
Le Fin!

[ Big dramatic bows. ]

JOHN RATLIFF, ENACTER OF PROPS



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Curtis ENTERS. ]

CURTIS
Ladies and gentlemen, they say that a comedy group is only as good as its props, so we’d like to take a moment to introduce you to ours.

Chaplin. Keaton. Marceau. Tati. These are legendary performers who spoke through their bodies, who turned movement into music. We’re honored to be in the presence of such a performer tonight. He studied commedia dell arte at the London Academy of Expressive Movement and was a sensation in the radical clown cabarets of East Berlin before coming to America, where he has devoted countless hours to preserving and sharing the joy of his artform. This man -- this middle-aged man -- will tonight, before your very eyes, prove that the mystic art of shapeshifting is no fantasy, but reality. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present John Ratliff, our enacter of props.

[ Ratliff ENTERS, bows expressively. ]

Now, we’re going to do a little sketch here that I think you’ll all enjoy, it’s about a group of bohemian artists, and it takes place in the very early 20th century, in a cafe in Prague. So, set your imaginationary time machines for--

[ While the preceding talk was happening, Ratliff capered around Curtis quietly, making “be quiet!” faces at the crowd, and pretended to make a hat on Curtis’s head using his hand. Then he moves to the side of the stage and impersonates a door, which Curtis moves to during his speech. ]

Wait a minute ... I don’t remember there being a door here.

[ Curtis struggles with the “handle” (Ratliff’s hand). Ratliff blows a raspberry. ]

It could use some oil.

[ Finally, Ratliff “opens.” Curtis EXITS. ]

[ Two artists ENTER through the “door”, carrying a couple of glasses and a bottle of absinthe. ]

MALE ARTIST
You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.

FEMALE ARTIST
It’s a lovely poem.

MALE ARTIST
It’s my favorite poem that I’ve written.

FEMALE ARTIST
What does it mean?

MALE ARTIST
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.

FEMALE ARTIST
Pavel?

MALE ARTIST
Yes, Milena?

[ They sit on chairs. Ratliff comes over to form a table. They put their glasses in his hands. ]

FA
I was going to say something, but first I will shut this window to keep out the breeze.

MA
Allow me.

[ Ratliff puts the glasses down to go be the window. MA shuts it. ]

FA
Thank you. 
MA
There’s someone at the door.

[ Ratliff moves over to be the door. A young radical comes through the “door”. ]

YOUNG RADICAL
Pavel! Milena!

FA
Yes, Tomas?

YR
I have published my pamphlet, would you like to see?

MA
We would!

[ Ratliff becomes a pamphlet. They open him. ]

FA
It’s wonderful, Tomas.

YR
Here is my favorite passage.

FA [ reads ]
“We are the new generation, born into a world of troubles but dedicated to the promise of a world of peace. Our highest ideals are not power, not conquest. Our highest ideals are truth, equality, freedom, love, and beauty!”

MA
I will drink to this!

[ Ratliff runs over to pick up the glasses and become the table again. Drinks are poured. ]

Truth!

FA
Equality!

YR
Freedom!

MA
Love!

FA
And, the highest ideal of all, beauty!

[ They drink. ]

YR
The highest ideal?

FA
Indeed.

MA
Justify!

FA
Well, consider this flower.

[ Ratliff becomes a flower. Beat. ]

Is it not beautiful?

MA
It is.

YR
What about it?

FA
That’s all I had.

MA
Bravo!

YR
Consider this, however! Consider this bit of crust which I now pull from behind my teeth.

[ Ratliff becomes a piece of crust. ]

Is it not, in its own way, beautiful?

FA
Truly.

MA
Most truly! I will compose an ode to that bit of crust.

YR
I shall make this bit of crust a symbol of our revolution.

FA
I shall make love to this bit of crust!

MA
We drink!

[ Ratliff becomes the table again, and they drink. ]

FA
To the beauty of everything!

[ Ratliff becomes all these things. ]

MA
An umbrella!

YR
A shoe!

FA
A well-worn journal!

MA
Rain in the hot summer!

YR
A plate of macaroons!

FA
A pile of stinking trash!

[ They name a few more random things, all of which Ratliff becomes. ]

FA
I shall make love to all these things!

[ Ratliff returns to being a table. ]

MA
I shall make love to you!

YR
I shall make love to both of you!

FA
Let’s all make love on this table!

[ Everyone begins to make as though to pile on Ratliff. ]

YR
Wait! We cannot do this.

FA
Why?

YR
Because the specter of World War I looms on the horizon.

MA
Yes. A war in which we are all destined to fall.

FA
Leaving only our lonely table behind.

TOGETHER
Our lonely table.

[ Curtis steps out of character. ]

CURTIS
Ladies and gentlemen ... the lonely table.

[ Everyone but Ratliff EXITS. Ratliff enacts a lonely table for several moments. Then he springs up and bows. All the neighbors ENTER and applaud wildly. ]

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

CASUAL CHILDBIRTH CO-OP



[ LIGHTS UP. There is a sign: “CASUAL CHILDBIRTH COOPERATIVE: Sit back, relax, and bring a new life into this world”. Two dudes, ART and SANDY, are sitting at a table. Art is playing Trivial Pursuit by himself ... he has a stack of cards; he pulls a card, looks at the question, looks at the answer, either smiles or frowns, repeats. Sandy is filling out a coloring book using a black sharpie.

An extended moment of silence as they do these things. ]

SANDY
I think it’d be pretty nice if we had some crayons.

ART
For the babies?

SANDY
For anyone.

[ Pause. ]

SANDY
Allison had her baby last Friday.

ART
Niiice.

SANDY
Yeah. At the hospital. I tried to convince her to do it here. No dice.

[ Art shrugs. ]

SANDY
It was crazy. I mean there she is, having a baby and there are these people everywhere. And they're carrying folders, and answering telephones and, you know, some of them seem to be in a real hurry and things can just get really ... brusque.

ART
That's ...

[ He shrugs. ]

SANDY
That's right.

ART
I mean, that's why we ...

[ He sort of twirls his fingers in the air. ]

SANDY
I know. That's what I thought.

[ ANGELA, a very relaxed and very pregnant lady, comes through the door, sipping hot tea from a paper cup. ]

ANGELA
What's up, guys?

ART
Not much, lady.

SANDY
What's up ... ... with you?

ANGELA
You know.

[ She sits down in an extremely casual posture. Pause. ]

ANGELA
So, what's up?

ART
Already asked.

[ Pause. ]

ANGELA
I know.

SANDY
We were just talking. About how we started this whole deal, and why.

ANGELA
Oh yeah?

[ She flips over in her seat, comfortably grabs and moves her pregnant belly to the side. ]

ART
We were talking because our friend Allison had a baby, but we couldn't convince her to go this route.

[ Twirls his fingers. ]

ANGELA
Her loss, man.

SANDY
A lot of women aren't prepared to consider the route of casual childbirth.

ART
Imagine her little baby ... first thing that baby sees in this world ...

SANDY
This crazy hospital where people are hurrying, and stressing, and all that junk.

ANGELA
Thumbs ... down.

[ She makes the thumbs-down, hops nimbly off her chair. ]

I'm feeling a little tight. You guys mind if I rock a few poses?

ART
Nuh-uh.

[ She does a series of yoga poses through the subsequent dialog, unimpeded by her pregnancy. ]

SANDY
So you thinkin' about having that baby today? Maybe tomorrow?

ANGELA
No hurry. Whenever.

ART
Baby'll come out when the baby's ready.

ANGELA
Or he can hang out in here as long as he wants. N ... B ... D.

ART and SANDY
Yup.

ART
You know, sometimes I don't even want people to think of this as a casual childbirth cooperative. I just want them to think of it as a really cool place to hang out.

ANGELA
That's how I think of it, guys.

SANDY
Thank you, Angela.

ART
It's just a place where everyone's cool, and it happens to also be a totally low-pressure, casual childbirthing environment.

SANDY
With zero stress.

ART
Like, if you're there and you think maybe you’re pregnant -- well, we’re here to help you have a baby.

SANDY
Maybe you’re not pregnant though. Maybe you just want to hang out.

ART
Yeah, that’s fine too.

SANDY
Maybe you just want to get to know some people, bang around a little, have some fun.

ART
Right. Maybe you like to party a little. Whatever.

SANDY
Maybe it’s “been a while”, so to speak, and you’re looking to get back on the scene, have some fun, a couple drinks, I don’t know, see what happens. It’s no big deal.

[ Angela breaks from her pose. ]

ANGELA
I'm not going out with you, Sandy.

SANDY
You shouldn't have to!

ANGELA
I know, I know -- but, for real.

ART
Hey Angela, I may just be hearing things, but I think maybe I just heard your water break.

ANGELA
What?

SANDY
You should check.

[ Angela pulls the waistband of her skirt open a little, glances down. ]

ANGELA
Whoa, there it goes.

ART
Looks like you're having this baby.

ANGELA
Looks like it. OK, you guys, well I better get to it, then.

SANDY
Take your time. Take your time.

ART
You'll just give us a call if you need anything?

ANGELA
Will do, will do. I'm just gonna go draw me a bath.

SANDY
You ... ... do that.

[ She nimbly waddles out the door. ]

SANDY
Having a baby, man. It’s amazing.

ART
Sure is.

SANDY
You just swallow up some sperm. Suddenly, you’ve got this awesome bulge, and it makes you walk all funny. Sometimes you get this urge to eat dirt and stuff. And the emotions just run wild.

ART
Amazing.

SANDY
Ten months later, a baby swims out of your butt.

ART
It’s the miracle of life, man.

SANDY
I know.

ART
But it ain’t nothing to get all worked up about.

SANDY
A-men.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ Some spooky music. Red light. CURTIS and COURTNEY enter in dark robes, hooded. They come to the front of the stage, remove the hoods, gazing skyward. ]

CURTIS: O dark lord, we are your loyal servants.

COURTNEY: Let our souls be your playthings.

CURTIS: Pose them. Bash them together. If it be your will, touch their faces to make them kiss.

COURTNEY: Sweet Satan, men’s feeble laws tell us you are bad. But we disagree. We think you’re great.

CURTIS: We think you’re great because you’re evil, actually.

COURTNEY: How fucked up is that?

BOTH: O prince of darkness, we await your coming. We pray for the cleansing of the earth.

[ The both hum together, making an evil drone. Lights snap to normal and they stop. ]

CURTIS: All right, all right. Could everyone settle down? Could we get a little quiet please? Please everyone, we just need some quiet and cooperation.

COURTNEY: Let me just say, it’s awesome to see so many new faces here.

CURTIS: Oh, no doubt. Awesome. Just awesome.

COURTNEY: But we just need your quiet attention for a moment. Can you do that for us? Hey!

[ Courtney tries a variety of kindergarten-style “settle down now” tricks. The third one seems to work. ]

COURTNEY: Thank you. That’s better.

CURTIS: Now, it’s no secret why most of the new folks are here, right?

COURTNEY: Let’s all say it together on three. One, two, three--

BOTH: Trump.

COURTNEY: We get it. We get it. He’s really bad.

CURTIS: Since November, we’ve had a glut of newbies who are suddenly so interested in the end of all human life on earth and so eager to help make it happen.

COURTNEY: And we’re excited to see it. Any path that brings you groveling to Satan’s cloven feet is equally valid.

CURTIS: But you have to understand, some of the other folks here … maybe like three or four of them--

COURTNEY: Ourselves included.

CURTIS: Yes, ourselves included … Some of the other folks here have been praying for the oceans of fire and the rivers of blood for years now. Some of us for decades, like my man Doug over here.

COURTNEY: Always count on Doug. The OG!

CURTIS: We love you, Doug.

COURTNEY: The point is, worshipping his eternal darkness isn’t a hobby that you can pick up when the headlines are bad and then drop as soon as a Democrat is back in office.

CURTIS: If we want to see Satan and his legion on the earth, tearing every human soul to pieces in their terrible jaws, in our lifetimes--or, at least, in our children’s lifetimes--we’ve got a lot of work to do.

COURTNEY: And most of it means getting your hands dirty. There’s a lot of sacrifices to make. A lot of blood rituals. I mean bathing in blood, OK? Not just a little hand rinse. There are holy altars to desecrate. There are nuns to seduce. There are innocent woodland animals to molest.

CURTIS: And there’s fundraising. New membership drives. So if you can’t imagine yourself wearing the hood, holding a clipboard, knocking on door after door, “Hello sir. Hello ma’am. Are you interested in seeing the spiky goat phallus of Satan and his retinue penetrate the world itself, and for their climax to drown us all in their bilious seed?” … Well, you’re not going to be much use to the cause in the long run.

COURTNEY: Sorry, you just won’t. We’re not trying to dampen your enthusiasm. This is just how it works.

CURTIS: And I know, you might wonder, “Surely there are other ways I can volunteer, right? Surely I have useful skills?”

COURTNEY: Please don’t ask us if we need graphic designers. We don’t. We don’t need new posters or flyers. We already have thousands of years of unholy imagery. Do a Google Image Search for “Satan.” There’s plenty of pictures of Satan, OK? We’ve already got the pentagram. A classic design that’s stood the test of time.

CURTIS: It’s a star, but it’s evil. Simple. Everyone gets it.

COURTNEY: When that’s not enough, we just take a cross and turn it upside down.

CURTIS: Elegant. Says it all, really.

COURTNEY: So yeah, we don’t need your Tumblr art. We need grassroots organizers. That means knocking on doors. And ladies: That also means letting a demon get you pregnant. I’ve done it. We all have to do it, ladies.

CURTIS: Guys, we all agree that Trump’s bad.

COURTNEY: So bad, guys.

CURTIS: Did you see what he Tweeted today?

[ Takes out phone. ]

CURTIS: Hold on a second … It was really bad.

COURTNEY:


COURTNEY: And now, let’s sacrifice some babies!

[ “Sabre Dance” plays while Curtis and Courtney take turns tossing baby dolls to each other like baseballs, while the other tries to hit them with a broadsword. ]

CURTIS: I know. Really? You want to start off with a political one?

COURTNEY: “We all know how bad things are and will remain for years, why the hell do we need to be reminded constantly?”

CURTIS: We’re trying, guys. But it’s hard.

COURTNEY: Pitch meetings have been impossible.

CURTIS: Here, we’ll show you.

COURTNEY: We’ll show you right now.

[ They sit across from each other. ]

CURTIS: I do think we need to address the political situation in our Sketchfest show.

[ Courtney immediately screams. Beat. ]

COURTNEY: I agree.

CURTIS: I think it’s a responsibility, in a way.

COURTNEY: Everyone’s waiting for our take. As a sketch comedy troupe, politics is part of our mandate.

CURTIS: And they’re pretty bad right now.

COURTNEY: The politics have never been worse.

CURTIS: Any ideas?

COURTNEY: Let’s crack open the big notepad.

[ Courtney takes out and flips through a large notepad. ]

COURTNEY: So, Jeff Sessions. That guy’s a huge racist, right?

CURTIS: Huge. Notoriously so!

COURTNEY: He’s going to try to make it possible for states to take the vote away from as many black people as they can. And that’s just for starters. I mean, this guy is just a huge, horrible piece of shit.

[ Curtis is nodding along energetically, but getting increasingly weepy. ]

COURTNEY: Anyway, imagine Jeff Sessions as a “Dukes of Hazzard”-type character. Because he’s really a cornpone southern asshole, right? He really talks like that. So he’s driving around in a Confederate flag car, from town to town, and he’s stealing people’s right to vote. And you’ve got the Waylon Jennings narrator voice going, like, “Oh that old Attorney General done it again. He’s disenfranchised every person of color for miles around. This here county’s going to be votin’ Republican until doomsday.”

[ Curtis, at this point, is still nodding, but has tears streaming down his face and is wracked by body-deep sobbing. ]

CURTIS: That’s pretty good. I don’t know how we’re gonna do anything with a car, though.

COURTNEY: With a toy car, probably. Or just a drawing.

CURTIS: That’s good.

COURTNEY: What have you got, in the whole politics realm?

CURTIS: Let me crack open the tiny notebook.

[ He does. ]

CURTIS: OK, so I realized that since Trump took office, there’s been this competition between fascism and corruption. Like, there was this power struggle between Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus or Jared Kushner, or whatever. And I’m basically finding myself worrying about whether I should be rooting for fascism or corruption to save us from each other, and how fucked up is that?

[ Courtney is nodding vigorously, but also quivering with violent rage. ]

CURTIS: So imagine that they’re teams, and we’re rooting for one or the other, with team jerseys and everything. It’s like, “Booo! Those nationalist fascist pigs want to kick refugees out of the country! Boo!”  But then, “Yeah, but these old-party military-industrial establishment monsters want to bomb the shit out of their home countries!!” And it goes on like that, becoming a more intense argument, until we finally reach some common ground, “Hey, but you know, neither of them give a shit about health care or climate change, right? Yeah, you’re right, whoever wins, we’re completely fucked either way!” So we hug and have a beer over it.

[ Courtney is shrieking in cosmic horror at this point. ]

COURTNEY: What if we blew our brains out?

CURTIS: At the end of the sketch?

COURTNEY: Yes, but also right now, and for real.

CURTIS: We can’t do that so long as we have the responsibility to heal the world and reform its institutions through laughter.

COURTNEY: Why did we choose sketch comedy, the most demanding and politically righteous art form?

CURTIS: It chose us.

[ ONE MORE BEAT that ends with us destroying our laptops, rending our garments, rolling around in the dirt. ]

[ This could either be the ending beat for this sketch, or for the whole show. ]

VOICEOVER: Citizens, this is your Attorney General. Please note that, within the current presidential administration, the forces of out-and-out nationalist fascism have scored a shocking underdog victory over the forces of entrenched imperialist late capitalist corruption.

CURTIS: What an upset!

VOICEOVER: As a first order of business, please be aware that sketch comedy, the most trenchant and politically efficacious art form, is banned. Any practicing sketch comedians will be apprehended and auctioned to a privately owned slave labor camp.


FOOL’S GOLD


[ BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR THE SKETCH PLAYS. Joel puts on a crummy cardboard clock face costume. He begins turning the hands. ]

JOEL [ as Grandfather Clock, old voice ]
Listen to the whispers of time, for they are my whispers. Yes, me! It’s ooold Grandfather Clock. Listen as my hands turn backwards, backwards, to 1849!

[ Courtney takes out one of Oscar’s music toys, plays it. ]

COURTNEY [ turning in place, with script ]
Whoooo-ooooo-aa!

JOEL
Backwards you go, backwards in time!

COURTNEY [ decelerating out of her spin ]
Heeeere we aaaarrrrreeee!

[ Turns off music toy. ]

JOEL [ as Grandfather Clock, old voice ]
And here we are! Why, it’s the height of the California Gold Rush -- a fever dream that reshaped this country’s destiny and named a football team. A time when pursuit of great riches rode the border of madness and enterprise. There’s many a tale gets told of this time. But here’s one not so often told. It begins in a smoky room, a room of bewhiskered men with fat cigars and watch chains. Listen. Listen!

[ Joel and Courtney make smoking and puffing noises. They try really, really hard to make them accurate. ]

COURTNEY [ as Fat Smoking Man 1 ]
A fine cigar!

JOEL [ as Fat Smoking Man 2 ]
A most superb cigar!

COURTNEY [ as Fat Smoking Man 1 ]
Well met, fellow millionaire! Let’s rub our well fed bellies together in celebration of our decadence and wealth!

JOEL { as FSM 2 ]
Yes! You can tell by my pants that go up over my rotund belly that I am excruciatingly wealthy for I can afford both too much food for my person and enough fabric to pant a whale’s calf!

COURTNEY { as FSM 1 ]
Speaking of, I have some blubber here for us to chaw on, carved from only the most endangered of whales and caught by only the most oppressed of natives!

[ blubber chewing noises ]

JOEL [ as Fat Smoking Man 2 ]
May the all-seeing eye hold its gaze on you, fellow millionaire!

COURTNEY [ as Fat Smoking Man 1 ]
And on you.

COURTNEY and JOEL [ as Fat Smoking Men, finishing the phrase ]
For he approves our undertakings.

JOEL { as FSM 2 ]
Let us engage in our most secret of secret handshakes, fellow millionaire.

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
Yes, yes, let’s do this, the most secret of handshakes now that our hands are sufficiently greased with whale blubber.

[ JOEL and COURTNEY clap and stomp for and extended period. ]

COURTNEY [ as Fat Smoking Man 1 ]
Yes, all is well in America.

JOEL [ as Fat Smoking Man 2 ]
Brother millionaire, I’ve made a magnificent discovery.

COURTNEY [ as Fat Smoking Man 1 ]
Speak of it!

JOEL { as FSM 2 ]
Gaze on this nugget of metal. Watch it shine in the sun.

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
It shines like gold, friend.

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
But it is not gold, friend. That’s pyrite, an iron sulfide with the formula FeS2, the most common of the sulfide minerals!

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
Yes, the gold of fools, named so because of its resemblance to gold!

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
Trickster of the sulfides!

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
Scourge of the economists!

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
It is.

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
Why hand me this, friend? It’s without value, despite its likeness to true gold. And you know I only touch things of value like this enormous diamond atop my platinum cane!

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
Hold the fool’s gold aloft, friend, and catch the light from the window.

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
Very well. I shall let this game unfold.

[ Shining noise? Maybe using the rim of a glass of water? ]

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
What delight! It casts a powerful glow. Why, the glow shines brightly on the small chest by your feet.

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
Let me open its lid. Now look on its contents.

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
More fool’s gold?

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
No sir! True gold, true as I am a man!

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
Extraordinary. So when held to the light of the setting sun, the fool’s gold casts light by which true gold may be found.

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
And so, as the saying goes, “By false means is the truth found.”

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
What phenomenon is this?

JOEL [ as FSM 2 ]
It’s beyond explanation, friend, besides this: the Supreme Architect still smiles on us millionaires.

COURTNEY [ as FSM 1 ]
All is well in America.

COURTNEY and JOEL [ as Fat Smoking Men ]
By the Square and the Compass!

JOEL [ as Grandfather Clock ]
Now, you bet those old millionaires tried to keep the secret of fool’s gold to themselves. But American secrets are like American buffalo; they’ll always roam free unless you shoot them from a train.

COURTNEY [ as Gold Prospector 1 ]
Keep picking at that rock. We’re sure to strike something!

[ Joel picks up two wooden spoons, taps them against each other. ]

JOEL [ as Gold Prospector 2 ]
I’m picking! I’m picking!

COURTNEY [ as Gold Prospector 1 ]
Well, pick faster, you old bag of donkey guts!

JOEL [ as Gold Prospector 2 ]
How come you never address me with respect?

COURTNEY [ as GP 1 ]
Look! You hit something!

JOEL [ as GP 2 ]
Aw, ain’t nothing. It’s just a hunk of damn fool’s gold. The scourge of the economists.

COURTNEY [ as GP 1 ]
Ain’t you know a damn thing, you old shitheel? Fool’s gold points the way to true gold. Look.

[ She makes the shining sound with the glass of water. ]

JOEL [ as GP 2 ]
Well, I’ll be dipped in horse piss! A vein of true gold!

JOEL [ as Grandfather Clock ]
It weren’t long before the magic properties of fool’s gold were known throughout our great nation. Demand for the blessed substance grew faster than a steam-powered train. Men began to carry fool’s gold on their person at all times so that they would always be able to identify the closest vein of gold. Soon merchants began specializing in fool’s gold.

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
Welcome to Charlie’s Fool’s Gold Treasure Chest, where we sell fool’s gold and only fool’s gold, fool’s gold so that you can find real gold! This is our lowest quality fool’s gold, which will lead you to the purest, highest quality gold. So, the highest quality fool’s gold is the cheapest, while the lowest quality fool’s gold will cost you twice the cost of actual gold.

JOEL [ as patron ]
But wouldn’t the fact that it’s more in demand mean that the lowest quality fool’s gold is actually high quality!

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
I’m talking about QUALITY here. Just LOOK at this pyrite! Beautiful! This one here, though, full of impurities and cracks, covered in coal!

JOEL [ as patron ]
Well, why don’t I just take this rock of pyrite, which is high in quality and low in cost, and use it in place of gold?

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
OUT! OUT OF MY SHOP! BE GONE YOU!

JOEL [ as grandfather clock ]
The real rub, though, was that you could also use gold to find fool’s gold! Soon people were carrying around chunks of gold to find fool’s gold, chunks of real gold they’d found with fool’s gold in the first place.

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
Welcome to Charlie’s Gold Treasure Chest, where we sell gold and only gold, gold so that you can find fool’s gold so that you can find real gold! May I help you?

JOEL [ as patron ]
Yes I bought this high-quality fools gold last week...

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
You must have used some low-quality gold to find that.

JOEL [ as patron ]
No, I bought it. Here. From you.

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
Impossible. I sell gold and only gold, gold that will help you find fool’s gold that will help you find real gold. Say, that’s high-quality fool’s gold. That could help you find some low-quality gold which could help you find some high-quality fool’s gold.

JOEL [ as patron ]
I already have high-quality fool’s gold. I was just wondering if you could make this nugget pretty. For my wife.

COURTNEY [ as shopkeeper ]
I thought you were gay.

JOEL [ as grandfather clock ]
And he was, he just hadn’t admitted it to himself yet. But he would. He would admit it one day to his wife and their children, causing her to throw his saddle and chaps out on to the muddy streets below their main-street apartment, all the while screaming about ruining their lives. That man, we’ll call him....David...Yates...Smithousen...the...seventh?...that man went on to invent the American bidet.

TOWER OF BABEL

[ Neighbors enter. SLIDE 1: Bible-busters. ]

CURTIS
Uh, I just wanna say, we are not here to bust the Bible tonight. Or bust on it. Just want to be real clear.

BRADEN
In fact, we’ve been legally enjoined against busting on, at, or near the Bible.

COURTNEY
No. This is a play on a popular TV program. I would say it’s a play on Mythbusters, but we’re legally enjoined against telling you that. So, actually, it’s just some name that doesn’t mean anything.

CURTIS
I’m a play on the one with the beard.

BRADEN [ wearing a hat ]
I’m the one with the hat.

COURTNEY
I’m the “fun” lady that you pretend is your friend, you fucking loser. Stop looking for internet pictures of me. They’re fake. 
BRADEN
Is that show still on, even?

CURTIS
I don’t know.

BRADEN
Blusted! (Legally, we have to say “blusted.”)

[ SLIDE 2: Logo now says “Bible-Blusters” ]

CURTIS
Anyway, we’re going to explore and blust a story from the Bible. “Blible.”

COURTNEY
First, a reading.

BRADEN
From the Blible. Bible.

CURTIS
Genesis, chapter 11, verses 1-9.

BRADEN
This is after God sent a flood to drown pretty much the entire world.

COURTNEY
Because pretty much the entire world had a bad attitude.

CURTIS
And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.

BRADEN
Thoroughly. These people know how to make bricks.

CURTIS
And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

COURTNEY
Gross.

CURTIS
And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven. And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

COURTNEY
Builded?

BRADEN
Nice writing, God.

CURTIS
And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and now nothing will be restrained from them. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

COURTNEY
Blurstorians believe that the Biblical Tower of Babel may have been inspired by the Et-e-men-anki, a ziggurat dedicated to the Mesopotamian sun god Marduk by Na-bo-po-las-sar, who was king of Babylonia around 610 B.C. It was pretty tall, apparently. At least for that time in human history, when things were generally not very tall. I think tall trees, even, would have been a pretty startling concept.

BRADEN
Whatever the initial inspiration, the Tower of Babel story has endured as an allegory of God’s unquenchable hatred for tall structures and linguistic unity.

CURTIS
But we wondered, which of the two really got Yahweh’s goat: the people understanding each other or the big tall tower they were building?

BRADEN
Because, you know, we just figured, it’s probably only one of them that got him really mad, and the other one was just kind of angry gravy, you know?

COURTNEY
So we put on our science hats and decided to BLURST this Bible thing!

[ Slide 3: “Bible-Blursters” ]

BRADEN [ pulling out a labcoat ]
This is a science hat.

CURTIS [ putting it on ]
We only have one.

COURTNEY
Which Curtis won the right to wear in a contentious game of Guess Who.

BRADEN
I think he cheated, but who am I, right? Who am I to say? Just some asshole, huh?

CURTIS
We arranged a simple experiment. First, we constructed an underground bunker, where we established a school for Esperanto, the universal language created by Ludwig Lazarus Zamenhof in 1887.

[ Slide 4: A bunker entrance. ]

COURTNEY
We chose a spot where the school would be below sea level.

BRADEN
Second, we assembled an international group of acrobats and gymnasts and asked them to form a human pyramid. Through careful vetting, we assured that none of the participants could speak each other’s language.

[ Slide 5: A human pyramid. ]

COURTNEY
Then, we simply waited to see which would be the first victim of God’s jealous and vengeful wrath: the subterranean language school or the heaven-scraping tower of uncommunicative acrobats.

[ Slide 6: The one versus the other. ]

CURTIS
We waited.

BRADEN
The participants in our human pyramid grew impatient. As best we could, we tried to convey the idea that breaking the pyramid would have serious consequences--that it would disqualify them for a prize, or maybe lead to death or severe inconvenience for their families.

CURTIS
Feeding and “bathroom needs” quickly became issues for the human pyramid.

COURTNEY
I could tell you folks some stories about the bathroom stuff that happened in that pyramid.

BRADEN
The whole thing was a horrible bathroom nightmare. I mean, from a bathroom perspective, it was one of the worst situations you could imagine.

CURTIS
We don’t need to get into details, but let’s just say that these guys in the pyramid had no choice but to just go to the bathroom all over each other.

COURTNEY
Like, you would see one guy going to the bathroom, and then under him some other guy would start going to the bathroom, too. And then everyone’s going to the bathroom.

BRADEN
But we don’t want to dwell on this.

COURTNEY
Meanwhile, our Esperanto bunker remained relatively free of bathroom or bathroom-related problems.

BRADEN
However, three of our Esperanto students died. At first, this seemed like an exciting result for our experiment, but on further investigation, it appeared that the students had not died from God’s wrath, but from the exceptionally poor ventilation.

CURTIS
Look, we built an underground structure without any appreciation of the kind of ventilation required. Sue us.

COURTNEY
Don’t sue us, though, because the parents of those students already are.

BRADEN
I proposed the idea that perhaps our failure to install proper ventilation was actually the instrument of God’s wrath. But our failure occurred before anyone learnt Esperanto, and God doesn’t have a time machine.

CURTIS
We blursted that one months ago.

[ Slide 7: God with a Delorean -- “BLURSTED!” ]

COURTNEY
Also--total transparency--I lied before. There were also some serious bathroom issues in the school.

BRADEN
Yeah, we didn’t put any bathrooms in the school.

CURTIS
So, without any real bathrooms, people were going to the bathroom wherever they could.

COURTNEY
The lack of ventilation made all the willy-nilly bathroom-going even more problematic.

BRADEN
Strangely, we didn’t lose any students, even with all of the bathroom problems. And deaths. I guess they really wanted to learn Esperanto pretty bad.

COURTNEY
We had intended to keep both scenarios running longer, but unfortunately, the array of bathroom issues, deaths, and other inconveniences made it impossible to do so.

CURTIS
So, we called it, and we worked with the results that we had. The underground language school was a hellish nightmare, but the sustained human pyramid was also no picnic for those involved. A few of them died, too--did we mention that? No? Well, they did.

BRADEN
So, with death and disease on both sides, our most reasonable interpretation of the evidence before us is that God actually does hate common languages and tall structures about equally.

COURTNEY
And every time you make a poo-poo or pee-pee in the bathroom, that’s probably God’s way of reminding you that you’d best not think you’re some kind of big cheese with your common tongue and your tall buildings, or he’ll scatter you, y’all. He’ll scatter your shit all over the place.

CURTIS
That’s it! Another Bible story blursted!

[ Slide 8: Tower of Babel “Blursted!” ]

COURTNEY
Next week: a comparative taste-a-ment of the Old Testament and the New Testament.

BRADEN
We’re going to put them in our mouths and just see what happens. Blursted!

[ Slide 9: “Bible-Blurmsters” ]

CURTIS
And, as always, we end this installment of Bible-Blurmsters by celebrating our deeper knowledge of God’s mysterious ways … With a cocaine and amyl nitrate fueled fuck party!! Everyone grab everyone else and put something in their A, bathroom style!

[ Slide 10: Blursted electro mix plays. ]

ICED TEA HARRY



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A man sits downstage at a table with a large pitcher of iced tea. He has a glass, which he fills up, drinks from. When he finishes, he pours himself another glass. He wears a straw hat. He has a fan and fans himself continually. He uses a rag to pat his sweaty brow. ]

[ Another man and a woman ENTER upstage, standing side by side. They deliver their dialogue in rapid fire, never pausing. ]

WOMAN
Another day.

MAN
Like the one before.

WOMAN
On an’ on.

HARRY
More of this here drink. I like it!

MAN
Who’s that?

WOMAN
That’s Harry.

MAN
Harry, huh?

WOMAN
Iced Tea Harry.

MAN
Iced Tea Harry?

WOMAN
That’s what they call him.

MAN
What’s he call himself?

WOMAN
Nothin’.

MAN
Nothin’ at all.

WOMAN
He’s been comin’ here for twenty years, every day, at that table, just drinkin’ his iced tea, and never sayin’ a word.

MAN
Not a word?

WOMAN
Never a peep.

MAN
Just drinkin’ that tea?

WOMAN
Dawn till dusk.

MAN
Madness. It’s madness, I say.

WOMAN
You shut your mouth.

[ She makes as though to hit him. He shrinks. ]

HARRY
Hoo-wee. Hooooo-wee. How dry my whistle. My whistle’s done dry.

MAN
You do it.

WOMAN
You do it.

[ MAN raises his hand to hit WOMAN, she cowers. She takes HARRY some more tea ]

MAN
Never no water?

WOMAN
No what?

[ WOMAN raises her hand to hit MAN ]

MAN [ Cowering ]
He ever drink no water?

[WOMAN goes back to normal ]

WOMAN
Nary a sip.

MAN
Nor nothin’ to eat?

WOMAN
Nothin’ but tea.

MAN
He use the necessary?

WOMAN
What did you just say?

[ She climbs up on a chair like it’s a turnbuckle and intimidates ]

MAN [ cowering ]
The restroom.

WOMAN [backing off]
Many times.

MAN
He sad?

WOMAN
Maybe.

MAN
He lose a lover?

WOMAN
Maybe a child.

MAN
Poor man.

WOMAN
Sittin’ there, sippin’ tea, trying to stay cool in this hot, hot world.

MAN [strutting around the stage in an intimidating fashion ]
Iced Tea Harry.

WOMAN
Now you’ve got it.

MAN
I’m gonna talk to him.

WOMAN
You ain’t neither.

MAN
I am.

WOMAN
You ain’t.

MAN
I gotta know.

WOMAN
You ain’t gotta know nothin’.

[ WOMAN takes man’s arm and twists it back ]

MAN [wincing in serious pain ]
I gotta know what it is gives a man a thirst like that.

WOMAN
Every man’s got his own thirst. [ WOMAN stomps foot, MAN jumps ] Every thirst’s got its own reason. [ WOMAN stomps foot, MAN jumps ] You can’t reckon thirst like weighing a sack of onions. [ WOMAN stomps foot, MAN jumps, WOMAN releases MAN ]

MAN [ rubbing his arm, hurt both physically and emotionally ]
He got a throat, ain’t he, to pour that tea down? He got a tongue to lick his lips, don’t he? He got lips to get licked by his tongue, don’t he? Then he can answer me one question.

[ MAN, from behind WOMAN, puts his arms under WOMAN’s arms, interlaces his fingers behind her head and she can barely struggle. She manages to get her hands up and slowly pry his hands apart. They break apart dramatically ]

WOMAN
A man’s mind is his own, like his pitcher’s his own.

MAN
I’m gointa ask.

WOMAN
Don’t.

MAN
Gointa.

WOMAN
Don’t. Don’t.

[ WOMAN runs to stop him and MAN turns around suddenly to do the Iron Claw. He prepares his hand, she mouths “don’t don’t” his hand attacks her forehead like a viper. He sort of leads her around until she falls down, head pointing downstage, feet pointing upstage. She spasms, a ref comes from the audience and does the counting and MAN is declared the winner. ]

WOMAN [ still barely conscious after the iron claw ]
Don’t. Don’t.

MAN
Harry.

HARRY [ doesn’t look up ]
Yup.

MAN
Your name’s Harry.

HARRY
Yup.

MAN
You ain’t know me.

HARRY
Nope.

MAN
I’m just a man. Just a man.

HARRY
As am I.

MAN
But I have a question.

HARRY
Each man’s got a right to his questions.

MAN
Yes.

HARRY
Other man’s got a right to the answers, though.

MAN
Yes.

[ Pause. ]

HARRY
Well?

MAN
Why you drink so much iced tea, Harry?

[ Pause. ]

HARRY
Tea.

MAN
You been drinking it long as I been here, and I been here a long time.

HARRY
Tea?

MAN
Why you drink it all day, Harry? All day long?

HARRY
I don’t like iced tea.

MAN
Pardon?

HARRY
Don’t care for it.

MAN You don’t?

HARRY
Wouldn’t never drink it.

MAN
This is iced tea, Harry.

HARRY
Never liked iced tea.

MAN
You been drinking it this whole time.

HARRY
Gross!

[ Harry takes a swig of iced tea, then spits it back in the pitcher. Does this until his glass is empty. ]

HARRY
Ugh, gross!

[ Harry storms out. ]

MAN
The soul of man is a great mystery.

WOMAN
Ain’t no way of reaching the bottom.

MAN
Never in a hundred years.

WOMAN
Even with the eyes of the angels.

[ Man picks up the pitcher, sniffs it, retches. ]

MAN
Something ain’t right with this tea.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]



PART 1

[ LIGHTS UP on Linda seated in a living room.  Joseph, her husband, enters. ]

Joseph:
Linda, I’m home.

LINDA:
How was your day?

Joseph:
Fine. Yours?

LINDA:
Good. Did you mail that letter?

JOSEPH:
I forgot. I’m sorry.

LINDA:
Joseph, that’s a very important letter. It explains to the electric company why our payment was late last week.

JOSEPH:
I know, Linda. I’ve just been so distracted lately.

LINDA:
What’s going on? You want to talk about it? Maybe we can talk about how it affects your ability to mail a letter.

JOSEPH:
Will you get off my back about the letter?!

LINDA:
Well what’s so distracting, Joseph?!

Joseph:
It’s these damn hands! They’re a curse! Cut these tools of the devil from my arms this instant!

[ Joseph kneels and holds up his hands to Linda. Linda yawns and sits on the couch. ]

LINDA:
Joseph, I’m not cutting off your hands? (GASP) You’re having an affair.

Joseph:
No. It’s something much worse.

LINDA:
I’ll cut off your hands if you’ve been having an affair, I guess. But I won’t use the good cutlery. I’ll use that old rusted pizza cutter you insist on keeping around. Then you’ll get tetanus and then you’ll get lock jaw and then you’ll starve to death. Now that’s fitting for a philanderer.

Joseph:
Linda, I’m not having an affair.

LINDA:
Then why are you being so dramatic?

Joseph:
I killed a man.

LINDA:
You killed a man?

Joseph:
I killed a man.

LINDA:
Tonight?

Joseph:
A year ago tonight.

LINDA:
Why on earth would you do something like that? You’re going to lose your job.

Joseph:
It was an accident.

LINDA:
Joseph?

JOSEPH:
Yes, Linda?

LINDA:
Are you going to kill me next?

JOSEPH:
What? No!

LINDA:
Well I can’t say it wouldn’t be a total surprise.

Joseph:
I’d never hurt you, Linda. I love you. The murder was an accident. It happened, last year, at the Stop ‘n Shop ‘n  Pay ‘n Save.

LINDA:
Oh my lord, you’re the Stop ‘n Shop ‘n Pay ‘n Save Strangler.

Joseph:
It’s true. It’s all true.

LINDA:
What happened that night?

Joseph:
I was walking up to the store

[ Joseph begins to pace. ]

and I reached my arms up to open the doors - you know how I like to reach for things.

[ Linda begins walking toward Joseph when his back is turned ]

Suddenly the doors flew open. My hands didn’t meet the cold metal of store front door, but the warm flesh of a human throat and then I unintentionally strangled a man.

[ At this moment Joseph turns with his hands reaching out and accidentally grabs Linda by the throat. He strangles her. ]

Joseph:
Oh no, I’m doing it now. I swear I’m not doing this on purpose. It was an accident. This is an accident. I don’t want to do this. I don’t mean it.

[ Linda slowly crumbles to the floor. Joseph goes down with her. He releases his grip once she is motionless. He slowly reaches his hands around his own throat. He begins to cough and gasp. He releases his grip. ]

Joseph:
Man, that smarts.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]






PART 2

[ LIGHTS UP. Joseph sits at a table. He nervously drinks coffee from a Styrofoam cup.

[ Two DETECTIVES ( 1 = Courtney, 2 = Curtis) stand on the other side of the stage facing him. ]

DETECTIVE 1:
He can’t see you.

DETECTIVE 2:
What’s that?

D1:
He can’t see you. He sees his reflection but we see through this like a window.

D2:
I know.

D1:
In case you didn’t know -

D2:
I know.

[ Beat. ]

I’ve worked here for six years.

D1:
Really?

D2:
Yes!

[ BEAT ]

D1:
I don’t remember you being here that long.

D2:
We’ve been partners for all six of those years, Mel.

D1:
Huh.

[ Beat. ]

So you know about the two way mirror thing?

D2:
I know about the two way mirror in the interrogation room, yes.

[ BEAT. ]

D1:
Maybe you weren’t sure and you were too embarrassed to ask because it’s been six years.

D2:
You’re an idiot.

[ Immediately. ]

D1:
Screw you!

[ D2 enters the interrogation room. He opens a file. ]

D2:
So. Joseph Barter.

Joseph:
Yes sir.

D2:
You were pretty busy last night.

Joseph:
I didn’t mean -

D2:
Why did you kill your wife, Joseph?

Joseph:
It was an accident.

D2:
You strangled your wife accidentally?

Joseph:
All I did raise my arms up like this and -

[ Joseph raises his arms and reaches out towards DETECTIVE 2. D2 begins gagging and gasping. He collapses and dies. Joseph is horrified. DETECTIVE 1 watches motionless. ]

Joseph:
I’m not doing this! I’m not even touching him.

D1:
Oh damn! Joseph Barter just killed that guy.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]



PART 3

[ LIGHTS UP. Prosecutor and Joseph in a courtroom. ]

PROSECUTOR:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. In the upcoming days we will discuss various elements of this case. I will present the facts, and the facts will all lead to murder. Cold blooded murder. This man, Joseph Barter, strangled a series of victims including his wife. I want you to imagine a man. A married man at home with his wife of ten years. It’s the same as every other day until he wraps his fingers around her throat, and with his bare hands he -

[ Prosecutor puts his hands around his own throat. He begins gagging and choking. He falls to the ground. ]

Joseph:
Shit!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


MIRACLES OF THE SAINTS



CURTIS
I’m Monsignor Luciani.

COURTNEY
I’m Monsignor Hopkin, a lady.

CURTIS
We’re with the Congregation for The Causes of Saints.

COURTNEY
You hear everybody squawking these days, “I want to be saint!”

CURTIS
You hear it everywhere! Bars. Cafes. The public library. Catholic sainthood is hotter than ever!

COURTNEY
And everybody--young kids, bikers, hustlers, architects--thinks maybe they’ve got what it takes for straight-up 200-proof sainthood.

CURTIS
We ain’t talking veneration.

COURTNEY
We ain’t talking beatification.

CURTIS
We’re talking straight canonization.

COURTNEY
People ask us, “Mosignor Luciani, Monsignor Hopkin, have I got what it takes for canonized sainthood?”

CURTIS
“I eat cage-free eggs. I help people with heavy bags.”

COURTNEY
“I sure never murdered anybody.”

CURTIS
So I must be a saint, right?

COURTNEY
Not so fast, paco!

CURTIS
Hit the brakes, hombre!

COURTNEY
You gotta clear a few more hurdles if you’re after full-on, hardcore, triple-X, DP canonized sainthood.

CURTIS
Being nice isn’t gonna cut it. Being faithful isn’t gonna cut it.

COURTNEY
Let’s talk miracles.

CURTIS
“Oh, Monsignor Luciani, Monsignor Hopkin, I’ve done a miracle, for real!”

COURTNEY
“I made some blind guy not blind anymore.”

CURTIS
“I removed my thumb and put it back on. It gave my niece a real jolt!”

COURTNEY
“I doubled a bushel of wheat with a snap of my fingers!”

CURTIS
Question: why are you wasting our time?

COURTNEY
Any two-bit chump with a touch of magic in his fingers can do one miracle, are you kidding me?

CURTIS
Try this for size: two important miracles, minimum.

COURTNEY
That’s right, Buster Brown.

CURTIS
Not so easy, huh?

COURTNEY
More than you bargained for, Bucky Beaver?

CURTIS
Even then, your miracles gotta pass muster with the Congregation for The Causes of Saints.

COURTNEY
That’s where we come in.

CURTIS
Now, quite frankly … we’re a little more selective than some of our fellow congregants.

COURTNEY
Honestly, there are some saints from the church’s past whose miracles just didn’t do it for us.

CURTIS
Different strokes.

COURTNEY
Takes all kinds.

CURTIS
But to give you a taste of the process, here are some notes from our own hard-hitting canonization reviews.

COURTNEY
Saint Christopher.

[ SLIDE 1 ]

He may be the patron saint of travellers, but, unfortunately, when it comes to miracles, Christopher doesn’t go far to impress. After carrying a child across a rushing river, Christopher planted his staff in the ground, where several leaves suddenly bloomed from it. Call me particular, but if that’s a show of divine favor, then there are a lot of miracle workers over at my local Garden Ridge. ONE AND A HALF STARS.

[ SLIDE 2 ]

CURTIS
St. Anthony Mary Claret.

[ SLIDE 3 ]

This Spanish stick-in-the-mud prophesied hailstorms would decimate the fields of farmers who didn’t attend a mission that he planned during harvest season. Where others see a prognostication of divine wrath, we see a dickish lucky guess. Don’t believe the hype; Anthony Mary Claret’s meteorological muddle is a BOMB.

[ SLIDE 4 ]

COURTNEY
Father Paul of Moll.

[ SLIDE 5 ]

It was said that multicolored birds would sing sweet songs to announce the coming of this Benedictine baldo. Pleasant stuff, but we liked it better the first time, when Francis of Assisi did it. Father Paul’s stale retread gets a RENT IT.

[ SLIDE 6 ]

CURTIS
St. Joseph of Cupertino.

[ SLIDE 7 ]

This guy floated off the ground during more than seventy masses. You know what, St. Joe? I had a few floating masses myself last night, and they impressed me just as much. This turd of a miracle gets a FLUSH IT.

[ SLIDE 8 ]

COURTNEY
St. Anthony of Padua.

[ SLIDE 9 ]

A statue commemorating this benevolent bagman is said to provide timely miraculous delivery of any letter you leave nearby. Glorified mailman! You don’t see me handing sainthood to Martel, my UPS guy--even though those brown shorts are better than divine! Nevertheless, St. Andy is a cutie--who could say no to those bronze eyes? St. Anthony of Padua--I’D HIT IT!

[ SLIDE 10 ]

CURTIS
OK, Monsignor Hopkin (who’s a lady) and I have a difference of opinion here, actually. Whether we’re talking looks or talent, I’ve got to exercise my ASS VETO...

[ SLIDE 11 ]

… Because, in my playbook, St. Anthony scores as a brotherly BUTTERFACE.

[ SLIDE 12 ]

COURTNEY
We don’t always agree!

CURTIS
We don’t!

COURTNEY
That’s what makes it kind of fun!

[ Curtis makes BELL sound with phone. ]

CURTIS
Uh-oh! You know what the toll of the bell means!

COURTNEY Fetch your umbrella, because habemas un Congregation for The Causes of Saints Weather Report!

CURTIS
St. Vincent Ferrer.

[ SLIDE 13 ]

A Dominican priest raising the dead back into life! The only thing that’s rising faster is our temperature--St. Vincent Ferrer is HOT, HOT, HOT!

[ SLIDE 14 ]

[ Curtis makes “HOT HOT HOT” sound with phone. ]

COURTNEY
Unfortunately, NOT NOT NOT so hot is St. John Bosco.

[ SLIDE 15 ]

St. John had a dog named Grigio. They said he could talk to the dog. Sorry, John; a furry friend might get you some chicks, but it won’t keep you warm at night. St. John’s animal act is FROSTY!

[ SLIDE 16 ]

[ Curtis makes “BRRRRR, THAT’s COLD!” sound with phone. ]

CURTIS
St. Clelia Barbiera of Bologna.

[ SLIDE 17 ]

It’s no baloney … her voice can still be heard echoing in the missions of Tanzania. St. Clelia … you are TWO CHILI … PEPPERS!

[ SLIDE 18 ]

[ Curtis makes FIRE ALARM sound with phone. ]

Because the mass in Swahili is MUCHO CALIENTE!

COURTNEY
And finally … St. John Vianney.

[ SLIDE 19 ]

He’s French! And he’ll read into your soul during confession, learning all your deep and dark truths! Well, St. John Edwards … I mean, Vianney, read this and weep: my soul’s giving you THREE PEACHES...

[ SLIDE 20  ]

...AND A HAMMER

[ SLIDE 21  ]

[ Curtis makes SPLAT SPLAT SPLAT THUNK sound with phone. ]

And that wraps this week’s weather report!

CURTIS
You know what my priest used to say about both a) the weather in our hometown and b) any given martyr’s chances for sainthood?

COURTNEY
What?

CURTIS
If you don’t like it, wait five minutes!

COURTNEY
Bubba da bubba da bubba da!

CURTIS
Bu bah bum ba baaaa!

[ They laugh, drink coffee. ]

COURTNEY
Back to you, Kathy and Hoda!

[ VIDEO ON SLIDE 22: KATHY and HODA. Curtis and Courtney dab their foreheads, continue to chat as they head up the stairs. ]

THE BEACH BOYS



[ LIGHTS UP. A V/O ANNOUNCEMENT. ]

V/O:
Ladies and gentlemen! Put your hands together for The Beach Boys!

[ THE TWO BEACH BOYS ENTER. ]

BB1:
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

BB2:
Hope you're all having fun. You having fun?

[ Beat. ]

All right.

BB1:
My name is Eddie Vale. I performed on the bass guitar for Al Jardine's Original Beach Boys family.

BB2:
My name is Brad D'Fazio. People call me Brad D. I was on additional percussion -- xylophone, etc. -- for Mike Love's Beach Boys and Friends Reunion Tour.

BB1:
We are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
And we're glad to be here at the 2009 Nucksua County Auto Show. There's a lot of really exciting stuff going on all around us.

BB1:
Cars.

BB2:
That woman over there.

[ Beat. ]

Cars, mostly. You know what I'm talking about.

BB1:
And of course if you know and enjoy songs such as "Little Deuce Coupe" and "Fun, fun, fun" you understand that cars are a big part of The Beach Boys mythos.

BB2:
It's a very inspiring subject matter. Really there's a lot to pull from it.

BB1:
Of course, we were not involved in the writing of those songs.

BB2:
Nor were we part of the original recordings.

BB1:
Come to think of it, I don't think either of us performed those songs on our tours.

BB2:
That is pretty odd when you think about it.    

BB1:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
I want to be very clear, we are not here to perform music.

BB1:
Yes, I think we should get that out of the way up front before there's any confusion. We understand if, in light of this, you may not want to stick around, you may want to go take a look at some of those new Hyundais...

BB2:
The ad in the paper might've been misleading.

BB1:
But, the truth is, neither of us is really that into music anymore.

BB2:
No, not at all. Not at all.

BB1:
After the conclusion of our respective tours of duty, so to speak, we got in touch with each other. Started booking ourselves at various events under the name "The Beach Boys".

BB2:
Figured we had every right to, and no one ever seemed to have a problem with it.

BB1:
Until they actually showed up for the shows, and there was a lot of screaming.

BB2:
Really stressful.

BB1:
Long story short --

BB2:
-- we have been banned from Joe's Crab Shack chain of restaurants.

BB1:
For three months.

BB2:
Longest three months of my life.

BB1:
Anyway.

BB2:
Anyway.

BB1:
We've kind of given up the music thing.

BB2:
That's right. Mostly we're just two friends who enjoy doing things together, now.

BB1:
That's right, so we thought we'd come to the auto show.

BB2:
I like cars.

BB1:
I got no problem with 'em.

BB2:
And we saw this little raised, stage-like area.

BB1:
The very one before you now.

BB2:
And I said, "Eddie?"

BB1:
And I said, "Yes, Brad D?"

BB2:
And I said, "Watch this." And I grabbed the microphone attached to the PA system, and I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, The Beach Boys!"

BB1:
And then we pretty much just jumped up on this stage and started talking.

BB2:
And that pretty much catches you all up to speed, right?

BB1:
There was no ad in the paper.

BB2:
No, that was just me riffing.

BB1:
Anyhow, since we're up here, we might as well talk about some things.

BB2:
Yeah, let you know what we've been up to.

BB1:
We're out of the music game, for one thing.

BB2:
Good riddance.

BB1:
I've been thinking about picking up some new hobbies.

BB2:
I already got cars to tide me over.

BB1:
I want to do the thing you do with the wood you find on the beach, you know?

BB2:
I like crafts.

BB1:
Yeah, things you can do with your hands.

BB2:
Very natural.

BB1:
I don't know what that's called though, so I'm having a hard time finding a book on it.

BB2:
If anyone knows what that's called, you pick up the microphone over there and just holler it out.

BB1:
I see some new people milling around at the edge of the crowd.

BB2:
So if you've just joined us, we're The Beach Boys --

BB1:
-- Eddie and Brad D --

BB2:
-- we don't perform music anymore --

BB1:
-- and we need to know the name of the thing where you take wood from the beach and make an art thing out of it.

BB2:
Uh ... does anyone have any questions?

BB1:
OK, it looks like you guys are kind of dispersing.

BB2:
Yeah, crowd's breaking up a little.

BB1:
Fair enough, fair enough.

BB2:
We really have no particular right to be up here in the first place.

BB1:
Yeah, we didn't have anything to say in particular.

BB2:
This thing we're doing up here has kind of run its course.

BB1:
Now I feel almost like I'm talking just to talk, like I'm locked in the groove.

BB2:
And I'm starting to see that there are some men in badges coming toward us.

BB1:
Probably security officers.

BB2:
Probably. And why not? They're just doing their jobs, we're obviously not a part of this show in any official way...

BB1:
It's pretty clear that we're breaking some rules right now.

BB2:
Not that the auto show necessarily has rules written down somewhere, but I think we can all agree that there's some unspoken rules...

BB1:
Like trash, for example. No rule you gotta put it in the can, but come on.

BB2:
And you don't see anyone else just climbing up on stage and running their mouths, so, I think, shame on us, ultimately.

BB1:
I think we just had an idea that we thought would be fun for us, but we didn't really consider whether it would be fun for other people.

BB2:
We didn't think of the consequences! Didn't think of the consequences.

BB1:
Now some of you look like you’re kind of upset with us.

BB2:
Like that woman over there.

BB1:
And we'll probably be fined, in some way.

BB2:
Or sent home, more likely, without seeing as many of these exciting prototypes as I would've liked to.

BB1:
And we're still talking...

BB2:
We're still talking!

BB1:
Which goes to show, we still have a lot of growing up to do, the two of us, in terms of learning from our mistakes.

BB2:
But really, that's for us to figure out. We don't need to burden you by making this a public spectacle.

BB1:
Thankfully, it seems that almost all of you are just walking around now, not really paying attention.

BB2:
And it would appear that our security escort is waving us off the stage.

BB1:
So we'll go quietly.

BB2:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB1:
It's certainly been a pleasure.

BB2:
And, uh ... keep on surfing.

[ THEY EXIT. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. Randy nervously sits in a chair. He calls offstage to a prostitute. Randy begins undressing. ]

RANDY:
My name’s Randy. What’s your name?

[ He takes off his shirt. He is wearing an undershirt. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Doesn’t matter.

RANDY:
I’ve never done anything like this before.

PROSTITUTE:
That’s sweet.

[ He takes off his shoes. ]

RANDY:
I kept telling myself to wait for the right time, and it just never happened.

PROSTITUTE:
This is your first time?

RANDY:
I’ve done other things. A lot of other things. I’ve done everything except vaginal intercourse. I’ve been with a lot of women but something always comes up when...you know.

[ He takes off his pants. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Like what?

RANDY:
Like....war. Sometimes there’s...a fire. One time...there was, like a problem with some-body's dog, I think. Like a bad problem. Like, it was a...bad...problem.

PROSTITUTE:
That sounds bad.

RANDY:
Yeah.

PROSTITUTE:
We need to make this special for you.

[ He takes off his socks. ]

RANDY:
Are you almost ready?

PROSTITUTE:
Just about, Randy.

[ He puts his socks back on. ]

RANDY:
Don’t take too long.

PROSTITUTE:
All ready. You ready, Randy?

RANDY:
I’m ready.

[ PROSTITUTE ENTERS carrying two ducks. ]

RANDY:
What are those for?

PROSTITUTE:
I’ve got something special in mind for you.

[ RANDY laughs nervously. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Now you just sit back, relax, and close your eyes, Randy.

[ RANDY relaxes and closes his eyes. PROSTITUTE rubs the ducks’ beaks seductively against RANDY’s mouth, etc. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Ooo, Randy, you just keep your eyes closed and think about all the nasty, filthy things you’ve ever dreamed of.

RANDY: [ giggles ]
Wow, OK.

PROSTITUTE:
We’re at Baja Fresh, Randy. And you can’t help yourself. You take me to the bathroom, and your high school nurses are waiting for us. They’ve got their bras on, Randy.

RANDY:
Great!

PROSTITUTE:
Oooh, Randy, you’ve got me in a stall. The nurses want to take your temperature because you’re sick. Oooo, Randy, I can feel your knee caps are getting so hard. You’ve got the hardest knee caps.

RANDY:
Yeah, I do.

PROSTITUTE:
You’re so bad. I should spank your butt, Randy. Spank it like a bad hamster. Your hamster butt is puckering. It wants to be kissed. I’ll kiss your butt so hard.

RANDY:
Uh, sure.

PROSTITUTE:
Randy, all your aunts are coming to visit. They want to know why you won’t visit them. My choo-choo is excited for fun. It’s getting hard, like your knee caps.

RANDY:
I want to go to Baja Fresh.

PROSTITUTE:
You want to go?

RANDY:
Now!

PROSTITUTE:
You’re ready?

RANDY:
God, yes.

[ PROSTITUTE throws ducks at RANDY hitting him in the face. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What?

PROSTITUTE:
Randy.

RANDY:
Yes?

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What are you --

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What are you do --

PROSTITUTE:
Ooo, Randy, you had your orgasm.

RANDY:
No I di-

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What are you doing?

PROSTITUTE:
You need more orgasm?

RANDY:
I--

[ BEAT ]

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

[ She extends her hand in expectation of payment. Randy shrugs. ]

PROSTITUTE:
You were so good, Randy. Fifteen hundred.

RANDY:
Dollars?

PROSTITUTE:
You didn’t like it, Randy?

RANDY:
No!

PROSTITUTE:
What do you want?

RANDY:
I thought we could start with some heavy pet--

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck! Eighteen hundred.

RANDY:
You really expect me to pay you eighteen hundred dollars?

PROSTITUTE:
Uh-huh.

RANDY:
But this isn’t what I want.

PROSTITUTE:
It’s non-consensual, Randy. That makes it soooo much hotter.

[ She laughs. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Everyone loves the double duck, Randy.

RANDY:
Not me.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck! How about now?

RANDY:
No.

PROSTITUTE:
Two thousand one hundred.

RANDY:
I’m not paying.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck! Twenty-four hundred.

RANDY:
STOP IT!

[ LESTER THE PIMP ENTERS. ]

LESTER:
What’s goin’ on in here?

RANDY:
Who is this?

PROSTITUTE:
Randy here got double ducked.

LESTER:
You’re a lucky man, Randy. She’s the best double ducker in the city.

PROSTITUTE:
He’s refusing to paying, Lester.

LESTER:
Randy.

RANDY:
What?

LESTER:
You’re not going to pay?

RANDY:
No.

LESTER:
And why not?

RANDY:
I didn’t like it.

LESTER:
Everyone loves the double duck Randy.

RANDY:
Not me.

LESTER:
Give him one on the house.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Now give him one on me.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Give him one on you.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Give him one so I can watch.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Now, give yourself one so we can watch.

[ She double ducks herself. ]

LESTER:
That was nice. All right Randy, here’s what’s gonna happen.

[ LESTER pulls out a butter knife. ]

You’re gonna pay the lady...

[ BEAT ]

...or I’m gonna.... cutthisduck.

PROSTITUTE:
No Lester don’t do it.

LESTER:
Shut it. He pays or I cut the duck.

RANDY:
I’m not going to pay.

[ LESTER stabs the duck. ]

LESTER:
Now you owe her some sex money and me a new duck.

RANDY:
Look, I don’t want any trouble from some pimp, but I don’t have that kind of money.

LESTER:
I ain’t no pimp. Just on my mail route, thought I’d drop in and say hello.

[ As he’s leaving. ]

LESTER:
Randy. I want that duck.

[ LESTER EXITS whistling. ]

RANDY:
That was pretty weir--

[ Throws the duck again. ]

COURTNEY:
Double duck.

[ She repeats double duck over and over getting quieter as she exits backwards. Curtis enters as this is happening. Joel is getting dressed. ]

[ Party music plays. ]

CURTIS:
Great party, man.

JOEL:
Killer party, dude.

CURTIS:
This party is killer!

JOEL:
I know.

CURTIS:
I like talking to you.

JOEL:
Cool, let’s be friends.

[ Courtney enters as “Bumpt It” Girl. ]

MALE STRIPPERS



[ LIGHTS UP on RANDY and the OWNER of the strip club, seated and in conversation. Owner is drinking from a highball glass. ]

RANDY:
So, the concept is this.

OWNER:
I'm listening.

RANDY:
I'm a fireman.

OWNER:
Go on.

RANDY:
I've been fighting a fire, maybe across the street or something. Somewhere close by.

OWNER:
I see it.

RANDY:
I've been awfully close to the flame. My body's sweaty and sooty.

OWNER:
I like it.

RANDY:
A voice calls out to me in the smoke, "Help! Help! Someone save us!"

OWNER:
The plot thickens.

RANDY:
The smoke is thick all around me, nearly choking me. My vision is obscured. I put my arms before me. It's so thick I feel as though I'm swimming, pulling my way forward through all that smoke.

OWNER:
The plot thickens, thick as smoke.

RANDY:
I begin to feel vibrations. A rhythmic pulse. Through my squinted eyes, I discern colored lights. Human forms, shaking and shouting in ecstasy. "My god," I wonder, "Am I still alive?"

OWNER:
The moment of truth.

[ Randy stands up. ]

RANDY:
As the smoke clears from my eyes, I realize that I'm on a stage. I'm surrounded by drunk women, some of them wearing tiaras. I look left, I look right. "How did I get here?" I seem to wonder.

OWNER:
Fair question.

[ MUSIC FADES IN. ]

RANDY:
These women want something from me, but what? The rhythmic pulse crystallizes. A modern interpretation of a familiar disco groove. Now I know. They want me to dance. My body resists at first, but the beat must have it's way. And I begin to dance. And before long, I begin to chafe at the restraint of my own clothing--

OWNER:
Let me stop you there.

[ Randy sits. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

RANDY:
So, that basically, is how I envision it.

OWNER:
That's the story of our fireman.

RANDY:
Right. Now, of course, the audience doesn't see any of that, but as a performer I think it's important to know where my character is coming from.

OWNER:
Let me stop you again, but this time here.

RANDY:
OK.

OWNER:
You have clearly given this a lot of thought, Randy.

RANDY:
I want this gig.

OWNER:
I can see that. I appreciate the fact that you came to me so well-prepared. And I deeply appreciate the fact that you recognize how crucial narrative is to the female erotic experience.

RANDY:
Mmmmm. Is that the faint smell of a "but" in the air?

OWNER:
But. But. I've seen stripping firefighters. I'm tired of stripping firefighters. I could go the rest of my life without seeing another stripping firefighter. Even one as well-drawn as this.

RANDY:
Come on now.

OWNER:
I'm quite serious.

RANDY:
See, this is the problem. The empty pursuit of novelty. Would you run around the High Renaissance saying "No more angels and cherubs! I'm sorry, I've just had enough of angels and cherubs!"

OWNER:
Yes, Randy, I might.

RANDY:
I could be a stripping blogger if that's "now" enough to you.

OWNER:
Please, Randy.

[ He stands, paces. ]

The point isn't to chase the new. The point is to find interesting variations on classical forms.

[ Calls offstage. ]

Isaac!

[ ISAAC ENTERS, dressed as a sea captain. ]

Take Isaac here. Isaac has taken the familiar figure of the stripping sailor and turned it into something novel: the stripping fishing boat captain.

[ Owner narrates as Isaac performs. ]

Times have been hard for his community, a community that has always depended on the commercial fishing industry to bolster its economy. But the pressures of a global marketplace, not to mention regional climate trends, have begun to take their toll. Young men, rather than than getting into the work of their fathers and grandfathers, are leaving town in droves. Enter our captain. He is still proud, too proud to abandon the work he's done for thirty years, though he can find no hardy young seamen to work his ship. He moves from bar to bar, club to club, building to building. Until, half without noticing it, he wanders on to a colorfully lit stage in the middle of a club...

[ MUSIC FADES IN. Isaac prepares to dance. ]

ISAAC:
I'm looking for a crew.

RANDY:
OK, OK, I get it.

[ MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

OWNER:
This is the kind of thing I'm looking for, Randy.

RANDY:
I see your point.

ISAAC:
What's the matter, young gun? Still looking for a high concept to hang on mister money and the stone patrol?

[ Indicating his genitals. ]

RANDY:
Not that it's your business, but yes.

ISAAC:
Get to it, greencheeks. You know and I know the ladies no wanna scope-a da pee-pee unless you cut 'em a fat slice of storytime up front, you dig me?

RANDY:
Yes, Isaac. I have ideas. I have plenty of ideas.

OWNER:
Oh, do you?

RANDY:
Yes.

ISAAC:
Not fireman, I hope?

[ Beat. Isaac laughs. ]

You kidding me? What is this, the inaugural meeting of the first chapter of the amateurs' club of America?

RANDY:
No such club exists, Isaac, and you know that.

ISAAC:
Ha!

OWNER:
What else do you have?

[ Beat. ]

RANDY:
Stripping construction worker?

[ Isaac chuckles. ]

OWNER:
What's your angle?

RANDY:
Maybe I got a call from the club? I think I'm there to do some tile work or something, and I'm looking for the bathroom when I find myself onstage...

ISAAC:
Oh boy. The panties in my mind are wet already.

RANDY:
I suppose you have a better idea?

[ Isaac pauses. He has noticed something. ]

ISAAC:
Wait. Be still.

[ Gestures to the owner. ]

Give me your drink.

[ Owner hands Isaac his highball glass, which Isaac puts in Randy's hand. ]

Hold that. Wait.

[ ISAAC EXITS. ]

RANDY:
What's he do--

OWNER:
Wait. I've seen him get like this before. Just listen, and do.

[ ISAAC ENTERS with a black turtleneck sweater and some glasses. ]

ISAAC:
Put these on.

[ Randy begins to. ]

Stripping construction worker. It's a no-go, kid. Stale as musty cardboard. But it got me thinking about how we could take it to the next level.

[ Beat. ]

Stripping middle-aged architect fearful that his gift has abandoned him.

[ Owner applauds slowly. ]

OWNER:
Isaac, you are a master.

ISAAC:
Follow me here.

[ Randy stands. ]

Don't stand. Sit.

[ Randy does. He performs as Isaac narrates. ]

Another late night at the office. The wife has gotten used to them -- hell, she doesn't even call anymore. A drafting pencil in one hand, a glass of scotch in the other, hunched over your desk. Is the drink there to steady the hand and help you create freely, as you've protested so many times before? Or is it there to temporarily silence that ever-present chorus of doubters in your brain, the critics who know you've lost your edge, the contractors who doubt your designs, the moneymen who no longer put their faith in you? The chorus grows too loud for the drink to contend with. You put your pencil down. In a drunken haze, you wander from your office, seeking experience in the evening light, seeking a refuge from the prison life has become. By some mysterious path, you find yourself in a club, onstage. Feminine shrieks and squeals surround you. The smell of vodka and desire. The sound of music. Suddenly, your body does what comes naturally...

[ MUSIC FADES IN. ]

RANDY: [ dancing, quite into it ]
Who wants to see my load-bearing support?

OWNER: [ jumps to his feet ]
By jove, I think he's got it!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

LADYSHADES

[ LIGHTS UP. Two street hustlers are at a table. They’re selling bootleg and knockoff merchandise. ]

HUSTLER #1
We got watches! You need watches? We got ‘em! High-class watches, genuine Rolex watches!

HUSTLER #2
Bags! Prada bags for your lady! Gucci bags for your special lady! Maybe you are a special lady? Get yourself a bag!

HUSTLER #1
We got computers, real computers! We got Dell computers, we’ve got Apples. Genuine article, real computers for computing. Download songs, use the calendar, install programs. Computers!

HUSTLER #2
How about a snack? We got Raisinets! We got Mounds! We got bags of Bugles, big bags of genuine Bugles! The snack you love, the snack you’re familiar with!

[ Detective Ladyshades enters. He is a tough cop who always wears women’s sunglasses. He walks across the stage. ]

HUSTLER #1
We got sunglasses, legitimate sunglasses that are real! We got Oakleys, your Ralph Lauren! Real sunglasses to keep the sun out of your eyes!

HUSTLER #2
Sunglasses, sir! Sunglasses for you! Men’s sunglasses! Latest styles.

[ Ladyshades turns slowly. ]

LADYSHADES [ pointing at his face ]
Already got a pair.

HUSTLER #1
Yeah, but...

[ The hustlers start giggling. Ladyshades is cool as a cucumber. ]

LADYSHADES
Got something to say?

HUSTLER #2
Just thought you might like a pair of men’s sunglasses, man.

HUSTLER #1
Instead of those lady shades.

[ Ladyshades moves like a panther, grabs hustler by the shirt. ]

LADYSHADES
That’s Detective Ladyshades to you, punk. Detective Mike Ladyshades. You got a permit to sell this knockoff garbage?

HUSTLER #2
Buh-buh-buh-buh...

LADYSHADES
That’s what I thought. Beat it.

[ LIGHTS UP. Ladyshades is sitting across a desk from the chief of police, who is in mid-rant. ]

CHIEF
You know what I don’t like about you, Ladyshades? You got ghosts. Ghosts, you hear me? Lot of good men in this department have lost friends over the years, but they haven’t got a whole army of spooks trailing them down the streets. Your ghosts are making you crazy, and this is a police department, not a haunted house.

[ The chief sits. ]

CHIEF
You hear me? You hear what I’m saying to you?

[ Ladyshades stands up. ]

LADYSHADES
Loud and clear.

[ He starts to leave. Gets his hand on the doorknob. ]

CHIEF
Oh, and Ladyshades?

[ Ladyshades pauses. ]

CHIEF
Take those ridiculous girl’s sunglasses off your face.

[ Pause. ]

LADYSHADES
You and this department can go fuck yourselves, chief.

[ He leaves. Outside, he lights a cigarette. ]

Maybe they’re made of lighter material or something. I just really like the way they feel.

WOMAN
I know it hasn’t been easy, Ladyshades.

[ Beat. ]

WOMAN
A man like you has seen a lot, I guess. And maybe when you’ve seen so much … maybe trust just … goes away.

[ Beat. She reaches across the table, takes his hand. ]

WOMAN
Thing is, Ladyshades, I’ve seen some stuff too. You see a lot when you grow up on the streets as the world’s deadliest female assassin. And maybe I had a time when I didn’t trust anyone, either. But you have to trust, sooner or later, or what does it mean? All the bullets? The blood? The people you’ve seduced and/or murdered -- what the fuck is it all for, huh?

[ Beat. Ladyshades slides an envelope across the table. ]

LADYSHADES
Happy one-month anniversary.

[ She smiles, picks up the envelope. ]

LADYSHADES
Best month of my life.

[ She opens it. ]

WOMAN
A Pier One gift card!

LADYSHADES
They’ve got a lot of shit in there that I think would look nice at your place.

WOMAN
I got you something, too.

[ She slides a box across the table. He opens it, slowly, pulls out a very masculine pair of aviator shades. Pause. ]

LADYSHADES
I should have known better than to trust a woman.

[ LIGHTS UP. Ladyshades is tied to a chair. A drug kingpin paces back and forth in front of him. ]

KINGPIN
You know something funny about me, Ladyshades? I love cops.

[ Beat. ] 
they keep amateurs out of the game. Clear out the little fish so the big fish have room to swim.

[ Beat. The kingpin kneels in front of Ladyshades. ]

Most cops are too dumb to catch a big fish, Ladyshades. But if a cop gets smart, my business has a problem. And I can’t let that happen. I’ve got responsibilities.

[ He pulls out a knife. ]

Buenas noches, Mr. Ladyshades.

[ The woman bursts in. ]

WOMAN
Ramon, no! I’ll come back to you if you let him go!

KINGPIN
Lo siento, mi amor. The cop has gotta go.

[ She grabs him from behind. They struggle. He knocks her back to the ground. ]

KINGPIN
You watch now. I want you to see him die.

[ He pulls out a pair of sunglasses. ]

KINGPIN
I’m gonna do one thing for you, though, Ladyshades.

[ He reaches for Ladyshades’s face. ]

LADYSHADES [ quiet, measured ]
Don’t touch the sunglasses.

KINGPIN
Come on, Ladyshades. You want to die like a pretty little girl ...

[ He takes them off, drops them on the ground. ]

KINGPIN Or you want to die like a man?

[ He leans forward to put the men’s sunglasses on. Ladyshades bursts from his restraints, enraged. He grabs the knife and stabs the kingpin. ]

LADYSHADES [ to woman ]
Sorry you had to see that.

[ He bends over and picks up his sunglasses. ]

LADYSHADES
Good thing he didn’t scratch them. I would’ve gotten mad.

WOMAN Oh, Ladyshades.

[ He comes downstage. She hangs off him. ]

LADYSHADES
I know it’s just in my head, but when I wear these, I feel like I see the world from a feminine perspective, approaching problems in a more intuitive way. And that improves my detective work! Also, it helps me keep my apartment clean!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[  A jock, wearing a basketball jersey, and a nerdy girl, both at a table covered with textbooks. The jock is constantly playing with a basketball. ]

COURTNEY [ trying to be patient ]: It’s algebra. You figure out what the value of x is. So we have to move these numbers around until we see what x equals.

CURTIS: Jeez louise, numbers and letters? My head is spinning. What if they fight?

COURTNEY: What?

CURTIS: Numbers and letters are different teams. They’ll be scrapping at each other like two pumas in a kennel.

COURTNEY: Where do you get this shit?

CURTIS: Coach told me. “Now you remember, Andy, different teams always play against each other. OCEANBEARS! Lemme see you swim-fish!”

[ He stands up and does a little dance. ]

COURTNEY: Cease that troglodytic nonsense! We have to get your grades to a passing average. I can’t help you in this moronic state of jock neanderthalism.

CURTIS: What? Huh? Duuuuuuuuuh.

COURTNEY: I will not see my admission to an Ivy League university derailed by a stupid monkey in a nylon jersey named you.

CURTIS: I thought you were doing this because we’re friends and you like me.

COURTNEY: Friends? Hardly. Friends?? You’ve got a funny idea of “friends.” Friends?!? I’m only here because of a comic coincidence that made it look like I was smoking weed drugs in the restroom, which I wasn’t. That put me in a tough situation where the assistant principal blackmailed me into helping you, the golden boy basketball captain, get your grades up. So you can play in the state finals.

CURTIS: Go OCEANBEARS! Lemme see you swim-fish!

[ He stands up and does a little dance. ]

COURTNEY: Focus, you big idiot!

[ She puts a peanut on the table. Curtis stops dancing, sits, and gobbles it up. ]

CURTIS: Uhhhhh.

[ She opens up another textbook. ]

COURTNEY: This is basic multiplication. Simple as it gets. Seven times five ... is?

CURTIS: Duh. I dunno! I’m too dumb. It's like my old man tells me: If god hadn't given me a talent for ball, I'd be riding a one-way train to nowheresville, just like my old man. My biological old man, not my step old man.

COURTNEY: You … have your own struggles?

CURTIS: Sure, everyone's my best friend, if we're having a good season. Teachers give me a pass, if we're having a good season. Most classtimes on most days, I'm crushing major puss in the bathroom, if we're having a good season. But really: I'm just a teenager with teenage problems and needs.

COURTNEY: I have emotions, too. And things that happen to me that make me feel various ways.

CURTIS: But you're a science girl.

COURTNEY: I've observed the structure of the atom. I've peered at the genetic code that gives us life. I've gazed at stars a billion light-years away. And what did I see? Nothing. The void. Death. And my mother is demanding! And I worry too much about the future, instead of enjoying the rockin' bod I have under these dowdy clothes.

CURTIS: Wow.

COURTNEY: I just wish I could help you understand this stuff.

CURTIS: It's no use. My head's too stupid for numbers. It's like my old man says: You puddle of stupid shitty goo, if you weren't so good at basketball, they'd grind you to nutrients and feed you to factory cattle.

COURTNEY: Gross.

CURTIS: If this was the court, I'd fake on these numbers and take it to the hole, basketball style!

COURTNEY: Hmmmm … basketball style, eh? Hmmmmmmm.

CURTIS: What’s that sound you make?

COURTNEY: It’s a thinking sound, dummy! Sorry. I’m starting to like you quickly as we share real feelings. Hmmmmm. Basketball style …

CURTIS: I love basketball. Hmmm. Basketball….

COURTNEY: Basketball….

CURTIS: Yeah, basketball.

COURTNEY: I’ve got an idea.

CURTIS: What’s an idea?

COURTNEY: I just need to put it in terms that you’ll understand. Let’s say I have … seven basketballs … and then I multiply by … five basketballs?

CURTIS: Duh. You’d have 35 basketballs.

[ She gasps in pleasure. ]

CURTIS: What? That’s just basic basketball. Any rookie could--

[ She opens up the other textbook. ]

COURTNEY: OK, OK. Now: solve for x. How many basketballs is x?

CURTIS: [ immediately ] What is this, junior varsity? x is 302.1 basketballs.

COURTNEY: By George, I think he’s got it!

[ Clutches her chest. She gets more and more into him with each correct answer, removes a garment of nerdy clothing. By this process, changes into her costume for the next sketch. ]

COURTNEY: What’s this … in my heart? Ah, god! American history!

[ She switches textbooks. ]

CURTIS: The Depression was a brick … but World War 2 was a real three-pointer!

COURTNEY: [ gasping ] My soul is hot! What’s happening?? Economics!

[ She switches textbooks. ]

CURTIS: If the basketball supply is low, but the basketball demand is high, basketball prices go up.

COURTNEY: OH, GOD! Cupid’s burning arrow in my heart-loins! Poetry!

[ She switches textbooks. Curtis reads. ]

CURTIS: One equal temper of heroic basketballs,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive for points, to seek the backboard, to find the hoop, and not to yield.

[ He wipes a tear. ]

CURTIS: It’s beautiful.

COURTNEY: You’re beautiful. I couldn’t see that before. But now I see the beauty of your heart.

CURTIS: I … duuuuuuh.

COURTNEY: The basketballs ... inside you.

CURTIS: You mean that?

COURTNEY: I’m in love with you.

CURTIS: You, uh, wha?

COURTNEY: I’m … in basketballs with you.

CURTIS: Sorry, I ...

COURTNEY: I’m basketballs with basketballs.

CURTIS: Still don’t get it.

COURTNEY: Basketballs basketballs basketballs.

CURTIS: Oh God, me too!

[ They embrace. ]



VOICE
Welcome to the stage, everyone’s favorite pop scientist: Marnie McFarnie Barnes!

[exciting music, cool video of space. MARNIE enters]

MARNIE
We’re all here because we love science. We love science. We love thinking about science, we love talking about science, we love finding ways to justify our life choices through science.

[holds for applause]

But science is mysterious and mystifying to most of us, right? Atoms, molecules, cells? What does any of it mean? Bwah!

[mimes juggling and dropping stuff]

That’s why I, the foremost “cool scientist” in my field, work so hard to bring science to the masses, to make science accessible to everyone. Science shouldn’t just be for blowhards and people with glasses! It should be for cool kids, women, real estate agents, black people and construction workers alike.

And what does everyone, regardless or race or gender or stereotype, have in common? Basketball. We all love basketball and we all understand things better when they are put in basketball terms.

I’m going to answer a few questions that were submitted during my Reddit AMA last week.

[picks up a card]

“Marnie, I can’t seem to wrap my head around string theory. Is there an easy way to understand it?”

Yes, there is. You can try this at home. Take two basketballs and tie them together with a string. Now you can see that the basketballs are one dimensional with no height or width, therefore supporting the ten-dimensional theory!

[holds for applause. Picks up another card]

“Marnie, is it possible that the bones of prehistoric creatures were put on earth by the devil to test our faith?”

No. Basketball no.

[picks up another card]

“Marnie, in the Kobayashi Maru…” Goddammit

[picks up another card]

“Marnie, I understand that evolution has created all the creatures we know of today but I just don’t understand how a monkey could change into a person.”

Alright “HornySolo2344”, it’s just not that simple. A coconut doesn’t just one day turn into a basketball. Over millions and millions of years only the best coconuts would be chosen to play the ancient Pacific Islander game that would one day become basketball. The roundest, largest coconuts were chosen and bred specifically for this purpose. Then they were bred for their bounciness, their orangeness for their pebbled skin until gradually the perfect basketball tree was created….”

BASKETBALL DUDE [from the audience]
I have a question.

MARNIE
I will take audience queries in a moment.

BASKETBALL MAN
Why would a brilliant basketball scientist free throw everything beautiful in her life away, everything meaningful and special because she was too focused on her career?

MARNIE
Who is that?

BASKETBALL MAN [coming onstage]
It’s your basketball team mate. One basketball plus one basketball equals love.

MARNIE
What are you doing here?

BASKETBALL MAN
Pleading with you to give our marriage a second chance. I even brought the kids.

[two basketballs bounce on stage]

MARNIE
That was a long time ago, when I used to tutor you, using basketball to help you understand math, physics, literature, French….

BASKETBALL MAN
Je jou le basket.

MARNIE
Everything was so simple then! It’s too complicated now! I’m a big science star! I have to spend a lot of time on Twitter!!

BASKETBALL MAN
It can be simple again! Come with us! We’ll make basketball love like we used to.

MARNIE
You’re right. This doesn’t make me happy! This doesn’t fulfill me! Explaining the every aspect of science in basketball terms is draining and soul crushing.

 [to the audience]
You’re all simpletons who will never understand science no matter “since is the fucking coolest” blogs you subscribe to. The universe is unknowable, mutha fuckas!

[they leave]

VOICE
Next up we have Mopey, the Clown Mathematician!

[ADAM runs out]

ADAM
So great to be here today!!! I’m gonna take a little time to explain string theory to you today….SILLY STRING THEORY!!!

[takes a can of silly string out and sprays it everywhere]

FADE IN:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

CURLISS addresses the camera from the comfort of a recliner. In his lap are notes. Behind him on an easel is a large pad of paper with a “Reel Phonies” logo drawn on it.

CURLISS
Hey people, it’s Tuesday, March 3rd. I’m Curliss, and this is Reel Phonies.

CUT TO - MONTAGE OVER MUSIC

CURLISS (V.O.)
I’m Curliss, and I used to LOVE goin’ to the pictures … until I found out how PHONY they all were.

MONTAGE - CURTIS REACTING TO MOVIES - “COME ON!” “YOU’S GOTTA BE KIDDIN’ ME, MOVIE!” “FAAAAAAAKE!”, etc.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

CURLISS
Welcome back to Reel Phonies, the only movie review show that shows how PHONY practically every movie ever made is.
(sighs)
Here we go, prepare for nothing to ever be that great again. Hey Ma, hit the graphics!

A hand comes in from offscreen and turns the page on the giant pad of paper. It reads, “Box Office Phonies.”

CURLISS
Another week, another bunch’a phonies at the multiplex.

CUT TO - TRAILER FOR A CURRENT FILM

CURLISS (V.O.)
Look at this. I was so pumped for this movie, until I read a interview with one of the stars and saw they used a pretend name for like the WHOLE MOVIE. Unbelievable! Whatta phony.

CUT TO - ANOTHER FILM TRAILER

CURLISS (V.O.)
Now look at this movie. Yahoo! Movies says this movie was written by some lady. Written! As in, they wrote down a hand-made-up story before they even made the dang movie! Pretty phon-a bologna if you ask me.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

CURLISS
Now it’s time to take a look back at the classic phonies of yesteryear. Hey Ma, the graphics!

The offscreen hand returns to turn the pad of paper. It now reads, “Classic Phonies.”

CURLISS
This week I chose to look at an interesting movie starring Scott Baio. At least I THOUGHT it was interesting, until I found out it was full of phonies!

CUT TO - CLIPS FROM “ZAPPED!”

CURLISS (V.O.)
In this movie Scott Baio PLAYS -- yeah, that’s right, another person PRETENDING -- a high-school student named Barney Springboro who gains the power of telekinesis. This movie is so phony I would be laughing, if I wasn’t so mad and completely angry too that is. Anyways, Barney uses his telekinetic powers to get into all sorts of trouble. He sure got in trouble with me when he made this phony movie! It has all this hilarious stuff that WOULD have been funny if any of it had ACTUALLY HAPPENED. And get this: I found out that for this “movie,” all those pretenders learned their lines ahead ‘a times! And they used machines to put the pictures together! And telekinesis ain’t even a real disease!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

CURLISS
I give this movie five zeroes, on account ‘a it bein’ so phony macaroni and all. DO NOT RENT IT TONIGHT.

CURLISS
And now we take a look at the life of a real phony! MAAAA!

The hand flips the page to read, “A Phony Life.”

CURLISS
Here’s Robert De Niro, who’s made an entire career out of being a total phony! This phony institution of American cinema first gained recognition for the incredibly fake job he did as "Johnny Boy" in the 1973 film Mean Streets (note: NOT a documentary). It was on that film where De Niro began a longtime collaboration with director and professional liar Marty Scorsese. These two fibber mcgibbers two would go on to make eight critically-acclaimed piles of total fairy balairy, and are expected to reunite alongside notable fabulists (a fancy word I looked up which just means Phonysaurus Rex) Al "Exaggerated Faker Voice" Pacino and Joe "Faker Voice, But in a Higher Register" Pesci.

INT. LIVING ROOM

The offscreen hand comes in and returns the pad to the first page, with the Reel Phonies logo.

CURLISS
That’s it for this episode of Reel Phonies. I’d say more but I gotta vacuum. Until next time, keep it real, and don’t be a phony!

Pause.

CURLISS
(In a normal voice, taking off his microphone)
Did we get that? Do we need to do any more takes? I've got rehearsal later, so--

Suddenly the image freezes and shrinks.

INT. NEWS STUDIO

The freeze frame has become a small graphic over the shoulder of a NEWS ANCHOR.

NEWS ANCHOR
Shocking never-before-seen footage of "Reel Phonies" host Curliss Muchiano was leaked today by an anonymous source, showing the host speaking in a normal voice and aware of his surroundings. The leaked video has spurred allegations that the popular Internet film vlogger may actually be none other than comedian and notorious vlogger impersonator Curtis Luchiani, currently under investigation for Internet fraud.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY - NEWS CAMERA P.O.V.

A REPORTER chases after CURTIS, who is walking from his car to the steps of a courthouse. Curtis is holding something that appears to be a giant fake taco.

REPORTER
Mr. Luciani! Any truth to the rumors that you are in fact Curliss Muchiano?

CURTIS
No comment.

REPORTER
Sir, how do you explain the fact that you have nearly identical names and look exactly alike?

CURTIS
Look, you'll ah, have to speak to my attorney--

CURTIS' ATTORNEY
My client is the victim of a media witch hunt, nothing more. Don't you people have lives?

Curtis and his attorney go inside the courthouse. The reporter turns and faces the camera.

REPORTER
Lots of questions, but still no answers. Reporting live, I'm Crystal Pumpkin, WYTN News.

(Pause.)

REPORTER
How was that? Did I sound "reportery" enough? I can't wait to submit this to SketchFest.

The image again freezes on an awkward frame.

INT. DRAMATICALLY LIT NEWS STUDIO

We're looking at the freeze frame on a tv monitor. Beside the monitor stands CURTIS, immaculately dressed and well spoken.

CURTIS
Good evening, I'm Curtis Luciani. Investigative journalists -- we rely on them to expose the uncomfortable truths that society would rather sweep under the rug. But are these reporters real people? Or are they just members of a sketch comedy troupe? Find out tonight, on Nextposé.

CUT TO: NEXTPOSÉ TITLE MONTAGE. CURTIS CHASING PEOPLE WITH A MICROPHONE, SITTING A NEWS DESK, TYPING FURIOUSLY. POLICE SIRENS. CRIME SCENE TAPE. MUGSHOTS THAT FLASH NEGATIVE. CURTIS POPPING OUT FROM BEHIND A CORNER, TAKING PHOTOS WITH A LONG TELEPHOTO LENS. THE CAPITOL BUILDING. SCALES OF JUSTICE.  CURTIS ON THREE DIFFERENT TELEPHONES, SWITCHING FROM PHONE TO PHONE. CURTIS INVESTIGATING COMEDY PROPS (RUBBER CHICKENS, FAKE LEGS)

CURTIS (V.O.)
Tonight: Sketch comedians posing as news reporters. It sounds insane, but our hidden cameras take you inside a secret world of double identities --

HIDDEN CAMERA P.O.V.
The reporter that hassled Curtis earlier is talking into a camera.

REPORTER
For WYTN News, I'm ... wait, what's my character's name? "Crystal Lumpkin?"

CURTIS (V.O.)
-- Memorized lines --

HIDDEN CAMERA P.O.V.
The news reporter that hassled Curtis is seen running towards us. We're looking out from a camera hidden in Curtis' ridiculous giant fake taco.

REPORTER
Mr. Bacchi Bacchi! Any gruth to the rumors that -- wait, "gruth?" Hahaha, what's a "gruth?!"

CURTIS (V.O.)
And ridiculous props.

HIDDEN CAMERA P.O.V.
Curtis is pointing the hidden taco camera into a mirror.

CURTIS
Hey guys, check out this giant taco camera.

CURTIS (V.O.)
Plus: Our interview with one sketch comedian reveals a startling secret.

INT. DRAMATICALLY LIT INTERVIEW ROOM

Curtis and a SHADOWY FIGURE are seated in the room.

CURTIS
Have you ever pretended to be a member of the press in a comedy sketch?

SHADOWY FIGURE
(In a modulated voice)
Oh yeah, all the time. It's easy.

CURTIS
Easy how?

SHADOWY FIGURE
Well, I mean ... you just need a suit.

CURTIS
Where did the microphone come from?

SHADOWY FIGURE
Well, I just got a wooden dowel, and put a foam on it. I made the logo out of posterboard.

CUT TO: EXT. CRAFT STORE - BLURRED OUT NAME

CURTIS (V.O.)
In fact, these supplies are easily available to anyone on the street. We tested this out a hobby store.

INT. CRAFT STORE - HIDDEN CAMERA P.O.V.

Curtis is at the register buying craft stuff.

CURTIS
I’m not a news reporter, by the way.

CASHIER
Uh huh.

CURTIS
I’m a sketch comedian. I’m going to use this in a comedy sketch.

CASHIER
Yeah … that’ll be $4.52.

INSERT - PICTURE OF THE RECIEPT WITH THE TOTAL HIGHLIGHTED

CURTIS (V.O.)
And she was right … four dollars and fifty two cents.

(Pause.)

INT. DRAMATICALLY LIT INTERVIEW ROOM

CURTIS
Are you pretending to be someone right now?

(Even longer pause.)

SHADOWY FIGURE
I'm pretending to be you.

The lights come up. The shadowy figure is Curtis, wearing his hosting outfit with the addition of a ball cap. He starts taking off his microphone.

CURTIS
How was that? Good. Oh, and how are are you going to match up the shots of me talking to myself? Computers?

The image freezes. A giant bologna sandwich animates on screen, along with CURLISS' disembodied head. And hand holding a bottle of mustard animates on, squeezing the words
 "PHON-A BOLOGNA" onto the sandwich. Curliss' disembodied head makes a sad face.

THE END.



Other ideas: A horribly inaccurate reenactment of the faux investigative interview we saw moments before. People who look somewhat like us reenact one of the scenes, and they are terrible actors.

Live version where each show has its own theme song, and the conflicting realities of who is real battle it out onstage (i.e. . Curtis’ laywer has a commerical: “Is your existence in our reality being questioned by the media? Are you the target of a media witch hunt? Do people claim that you are not real? Call me, etc. …”’

REAR PROJECTION 1



[ HARMONICA MUSIC. SPOTLIGHT UP ON A DIRECTOR, sitting in a director's chair. ]

Director:
Hello.

[ A series of signs: "Your Terrific Neighbors", "present", "a tribute to Hollywood's second unit directors." ]

Director:
Hello. My name is Sam Parks. Folks used to call me "Spinout." Spinout Parks. Why? I'll tell ya why.


[ Next sign: 'Sam "Spinout" Parks.' ]

Director:
I didn't start out second unit, you understand. I started out in stuntwork. That's how I met the legendary Hal Needham. Hal told me he needed a second unit guy for "Smokey and the Bandit," and I said "Why not?" That's how it all started. "Smokey" was a hell of an experience. One of those pictures that only comes along once in a lifetime, you know, and afterwards nothing's quite the same. I don't mind telling you that Burt Reynolds was just about the handsomest damn rascal my eyes had ever seen. And Jackie Gleason -- I've never seen a man sweat like that before or since. The man could sweat, all day, just beautifully. It was like watching a chubby cherub from a renaissance painting just sweating his little angelic pores out. Sheets of moisture cascading down that man's face like some great waterfall.

[ Pause. HARMONICA MUSIC SLOWLY BEGINS TO FADE OUT. ]

Director:
Anyhow, I suppose my most vivid experiences on that picture were the rear projection shots. That's when I really discovered my second-unit voice. I remember it so vividly, to this day, that I could practically re-enact it for you right now.

[ FULL LIGHTS UP. A P.A. ENTERS with a clipboard and approaches Director. ]

PA:
So we've just got to pound out the rear projection stuff today?

Director:
We aren't "pounding" anything out.

PA:
I'm sorry?

[ He snatches the clipboard. ]

Director:
Every shot counts, son. This is where the whole damn film comes to a head. Bandit's runnin', the smokeys are at his back. We do this right and we keep the audience right there, locked into the chase. Or we can get sloppy, "pound it out," and lose them in the home stretch. Now which one you think we oughtta do?

[ Pause. ]

Director:
Check the focus on that lens, god damn it.

[ PA EXITS. An EXTRA ENTERS in a cowboy hat and a badge. ]

Extra:
We ready?

Director:
Yes.

[ Glances at clipboard. ]

Sit.

[ Extra sits at two chairs side by side, arranged like a carseat. Grips the "steering wheel." Directors sits too. ]

Director:
So, how comfortable are you with the scene?

Extra:
I thought we're just getting the one shot.

Director:
Right. It's a one-shot scene.

Extra:
Yeah. Uh, fine, then.

Director:
Fine? All right. Let's get rolling. Try our first instincts.

[ PA ENTERS. ]

PA:
Camera's rolling. Take one.

Director:
Action!

[ Extra grips the "steering wheel," screams comically and bug eyed. ]

Director:
Cut! ... OK, um ... Let's try that again, maybe? Get a different level of energy?

Extra:
Sure.

PA:
Take two!

Director:
Action!

[ This time, throws up both arms, gives a low-to-high "whoooooa!" ]

Director:
Cut! ... ah, maybe one more? Get loose with it.

PA:
Take three!

Director:
Action!

[ Something different this time, and pretty weak. ]

Director:
Cut! Could we stop those cameras rolling for a moment?

Extra:
Am I done?

Director:
I don't think we've got it yet. Now, help me out here: what's really going on in this scene?

Extra:
Uh. Well, I'm one of the cops that's chasing the Bandit, and he's tricked me into going up this ramp, so I'm spinning through the air. So they said we do one of these rear-projection shot thingies and I scream and holler and you guys put the background in so it looks like the car's --

Director:
That's what happens in the scene. What's really going on?

Extra:
Pardon me?

Director:
Do you want to catch the bandit?

[ Pause. ]

Extra:
Yes.

Director:
But forget that now, right? He's got the better of you, and now your car and your reputation at the station are ruined. How does that make you feel?

Extra:
... Angry, I suppose.

Director:
Well, I'm not seeing that.

[ Pause. ]

Extra:
You want to do it again?

Director:
You understand me. Let's roll 'em.

PA:
Take four!

Director:
OK, find it. Don't let it out until you're ready, all right? And ... when you're ready ... ... ... action.

[ Extra is flummoxed. Pause. Tries contorting his face a few different ways, abandons them. Finally let's out a heart yell, looking both ways, gripping the seat, tugging on his hat. ]

Director:
Cut! All right, all right! That's what I was looking for. We keep moving at this rate, and we'll have this in the can by sundown.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]



REAR PROJECTION 2



[ SPOTLIGHT UP. MORE HARMONICA MUSIC. The director again. ]

Director:
Well, I suppose "Smokey and The Bandit"'s success got people talking about me, because before I knew it I had Mr. John Landis coming to call, saying he'd like me to do second unit for a new film of his, a project called "The Blues Brothers." Why, I remember that one pretty well, too ...

[ FULL LIGHTS UP. An EXTRA (#2) ENTERS dressed as a cop, sits. ]

Extra:
You're not making any sense. So you don't want me to react while the car is flying off the highway ramp?

Director: No no no no no ... please, try and hear what I'm saying.

[ Pause. ]

Director:
You've been on the tail of Jake and Elwood Blues for a while now. They've eluded scores of your colleagues. With your own eyes, you've seen men you personally admire, who you look to as mentors or comrades-in-arms, made fools by these two criminals. So what I think we need to see is a reaction that's tinted with foreknowledge of the situation. As your car flies off the highway ramp, you recognize that this was always your destiny --

[ PA ENTERS. ]

PA:
Mr. Parks, Mr. Landis says they really need this footage to start editing this --

Director:
Landis knew my fucking process when he hired me so tell him he can fucking wait!

[ PA EXITS, RUNNING. ]

Director:
All right, let's use this energy.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]



REAR PROJECTION 3


[ SPOTLIGHT UP ON THE DIRECTOR. HARMONICA MUSIC AGAIN. ]

Director:
Well, I guess I have John Landis to thank for my reputation as a "difficult" collaborator. Word got around, and it did hurt me. It did. The high-profile projects dried up for me for a while. But there were some good people at Disney who respected the work I had done, and that's how I got second unit for "Herbie Goes Bananas." That one ... that one was a real pleasure.

[ FULL LIGHTS UP. An EXTRA (#3) DRESSED AS A RACE CAR DRIVER ENTERS and sits. ]

Extra:
I think it's the frustration that has to get across here.

Director:
Absolutely.

Extra:
Like, the frustration of powerlessness. "Is this love bug ever gonna quit?" Every time I get an angle on him, he's got some new trick up his sleeve.

Director:
That's how I read it, too. That's what the audience needs to see from you. Herbie is still our hero, but in this one moment, we identify with you.

Extra:
Right. He's pulling ahead of me for the third time. I'm losing focus; I'm losing confidence. I look through the window at the driver, my adversary. And he's not even driving! He's eating a sandwich! The car is driving itself. Well, that's the last straw. It breaks whatever focus I have left, and I spin out of control.

[ Pause. The director is impressed. ]

Director:
That's your arc. Now let's tap into that.

PA:
We're rolling!

Director:
Hold on a moment. ... Jerry, artistically speaking, this has been one of the most rewarding collaborations of my career.

Extra:
I appreciate that, Sam.

Director:
All right. Let's make some movie magic.

PA:
Take one!

Director:
Action!

[ The extra makes a series of exaggerated, shticky gestures. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

CICADAS


[ Joel and Courtney turn around and pull black trash bags over their bodies. Curtis stands in place and makes buzzing, cicada-like sounds. Pause for a moment. Courtney begins wriggling in her trash bag. Suddenly, she tears through. ]

COURTNEY
At last! The surface! After so many years in the hard and moist earth, so many years of waiting, now is my time to live and love and wander.

[ Wide-eyed, she crosses back and forth across the stage. ]

COURTNEY
What does this wide world hold for me? What splendid songs shall I hear? And what songs, when my time has come, shall I myself be inspired to sing?

CURTIS
Don’t waste your time.

[ Courtney, startled, turns to Curtis. ]

CURTIS
That’s my advice to you. Because you don’t have much left.

COURTNEY
Pardon?

CURTIS (sighs)
I almost forgot.

[ He unfolds a piece of paper and reads the following ]

CURTIS
“Welcome, young Magicicada, to the surface. We hope you have enjoyed your long years underground as a nymph: burrowing, digging, growing into the nymphal instar which moments ago broke through to the surface and discarded it’s old body.”

COURTNEY
It was splendid but can’t compare to the many amazing encounters I will have here in the above world!

CURTIS
“We know how tired you must be from your numerous subterranean adventures so if there is anything you need to make your remaining six weeks of life more comfortable, please do not hesitate to make your needs known to your assigned Cicada Orientation Leader.”

[ Curtis raises his hand to identify himself. ]

COURTNEY
I have but Six weeks?!

[ She makes a loud and obnoxious cicada noise. ]

CURTIS
Six weeks. That’s what I said. What?

COURTNEY
What manner of gruesome greeting is this? I should batter you with my membranous front wings!

CURTIS
If it helps.

[ Joel bursts out of his trash bag. ]

JOEL
Yeah!! Surface! Woo!

COURTNEY
Welcome, fellow.

JOEL
What does this bigass world hold for me? What fucking awesome songs shall I hear? And what fucking awesome songs, when my time has come, shall I myself be inspired to --

COURTNEY
You have but six weeks to live!

CURTIS
Projected average.

JOEL
The fuck?!

CURTIS
Hey, I’m the orientation leader here. I have the script!

JOEL
I don’t think you understand. I just got here. This is my time on the surface, bro.

CURTIS
I don’t think you understand.

COURTNEY
But this is our time, you see? It is our time to sing!

[ Courtney and Joel make a loud and obnoxious cicada noise. ]

JOEL
Yeah! I’m ‘bout ready to rock my tymbals, lure some females with my sweet song, and do some bug fuckin’.
[ to Courtney ]
How about you? You want a piece of this action?

COURTNEY
I am a male. I also sing.

[ Makes the noise in Joel’s face. ]

JOEL
Hard to tell with us, I guess. I don’t even give a shit. I just burst out of my body with a whole new body, and I got wings, and I am horny as fuck and ready to rock this bug dick all over the damn place.

CURTIS
Better get to it, son. There’s not much time left. Trust me. It goes by quick. But at least you guys had some good times underground, right?

COURTNEY
Not many things happened underground.

JOEL
Yeah. And it was so dark that the nymphette I thought I was tagging turned out to be a fossilized human arrow head. Took me six years to realize why she wasn’t moving around much.

CURTIS
But there was so much to do, you poor young fools! Don’t you get it? Underground, not here on the damn surface -- those are the good times, the ones to savor.

COURTNEY
Oh, do tell!

CURTIS
There’s digging holes, crawling through holes you or other bugs have been digging, the art museums, orgies --

COURTNEY
Oh my, art museums?!

JOEL
Orgies?!

CURTIS
You guys really missed out. I mean there’s really nothing left after this. Unless you want to sign up to be an orientation leader. I get ten leaf-bits for every application.

COURTNEY
But all that time in the darkness. I thought it would be different here. I shall scrawl my own surface-poetry into the skin of a deciduous leaf, and it will be read and quoted for the all-of-time. My brief time on the surface, as well as my much longer time underground, shall not have been for naught. I will create beauty and find love.

JOEL [ pointing to Courtney ]
You hear that! You hear that fuckin’ attitude?? That’s beautiful. That’s living, man. My bug dick is getting rock hard just hearing that shit. I gotta fuck something soon or my exoskeleton’s gonna blow. I don’t care if you are a male.

CURTIS
You guys just need to take it easy. Maybe you’ll be productive creatively. Maybe you’ll get to have sex with a female. Maybe. But you two will be lucky if you’re not eaten by the winged swoop-beasts by tomorrow morning, OK. So take it easy.

COURTNEY
I am cicada and tired of your dreadful attitude. Let’s go, companion, you and I, and sing our songs together, for slightly different reasons.

JOEL
Fuck yes!

COURTNEY
For art!

JOEL
So I can fuuuuck!

[ They begin making their screeching cicada noises again. Curtis pushes between them, starts screeching, vaguely, the melody of “Jessica” by The Allman Brothers. After a moment, Courtney interrupts him. ]

COURTNEY
What is this terrible song? Why do you pain us with this terrible song? Is this some manner of surface humor?

CURTIS
There is no humor on the surface. There is no love or beauty. It is survival and pain. On the off chance you do find love it will only be interrupted by the sight of your lover being torn apart by a mighty winged swoop-beast, it’s horrible cry echoing in the night …. You’ll be alone, with only the song of your lament to comfort you.

[ Curtis screeches his song again. ]

COURTNEY
Is that “Jessica” by The Allman Brothers?

CURTIS
Yes.

JOEL
The Allman Brothers suck!

CURTIS
You know nothing! It was the song that I heard, drifting up from the window of one of the human’s wooden burrows, as I saw my love torn apart before me, her torn egg sac spilling our broodlings over the dusty ground.

[ Pause. ]

JOEL
Whatever, man. The song is hippie bullshit and is like a million hours long.

COURTNEY
Hippie bullshit. Turn your ears, old one, to the hearing of our new song.

[ They both sing. It sounds like “Jessica”. ]

CURTIS
That was the same song!

COURTNEY
Not really.

JOEL
Nope.

CURTIS
It was --

JOEL and COURTNEY
Oh my god!!

[ Curtis runs offstage, screaming. ]

COURTNEY
A swoop-beast! They are lured by the melody.

JOEL
What melody?

[ Courtney sings “Jessica” again. ]

JOEL
Oh my god!!!

[ Courtney runs offstage, screaming. ]

JOEL
NO!!! Oh, god, this life is hard. The old one was right. This surface life is hard. So very, very hard.

[ Beat. ]

But if I am destined to die, I will face it like a true cicada.

[ Beat. ]

And I swear, before I meet my maker, I shall be the first of my kind to bug-fuck a swoop-beast in its stupid beak.

[ He sings “Jessica”. Stop, screams, runs offstage. ]

JOEL
Oh no!! What a bad idea......!!

FDR



COURTNEY
Poliomyelitis, or polio, is an acute viral infectious disease. In the American mind, of course, polio is inseparable from its most famous victim: President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Students of history know that President Roosevelt and his advisers concealed his condition from the public, fearing that Americans would not accept a cripple as their president.

But few know of the immense strain this deception put on the president’s conscience, and the secret yearly ritual he devised to combat it...

[ COURTNEY now assumes the role of Eleanor. ]

[ FDR and Eleanor are waiting in the oval office. ]

FDR
Eleanor, old thing, today is June 1st.

ELEANOR
It is, indeed.

FDR
My favorite day of any on the calendar.

ELEANOR
I’m pleased, Franklin.

FDR
For today, Eleanor, dear old cow, I enjoy the highest dignity of office: to meet with one of the ordinary folks and shake his hand.

ELEANOR
[ belches ]

FDR
What a fine, ripping belch, old pet.

ELEANOR
It was a pleasure to produce it.

FDR
And then to reveal to this humble citizen my own troubles! To share my affliction with him … oh, Eleanor, what a salve.

ELEANOR
Don’t you worry, Franklin dear, that after a night of cheap moonshine and barn dancing this fellow might reveal our secret to some nickel-and-dime haystack floozy?

FDR
Not a whit, old melon. We’ve done this thrice before, after all, and none of our visitors have betrayed us.

[ Knock at the door. ]

Please show him in, old mop.

ELEANOR
Yes, your highness.

[ A dumb farmer ENTERS. ]

FARMER Jiminy Joseph, oh my stars, it’s the prezzident hisself. Strike me dead if they wasn’t even lyin’, but here I stand and there he is as livin’ durn proof!

FDR
Well met, fellow.

FARMER
And th’ same to you sir, sure enough. When the lord done sent the dust clouds after me for all my crop and all my thirteen boys, I figured to myself, “Aw, Three Bean, you sorry old sack of wheat, you done been forsaken for all times.” And yet here I am not four years later, standin’ at the feet of Franklin Delan-ny Roosevelt himself. Wahoo!

ELEANOR
Three Bean, you say?

FARMER
Yes ma’am, missus Roosey-velt, all my friends call me Three Bean, on account of that’s my Christian name. Three Bean Judson.

ELEANOR
It’s a pleasure, Three Bean.

[ Farmer kisses her hand. ]

FARMER
Likewise.

FDR
Three Bean, we’ve invited you here for a special purpose.

FARMER
I’m like to burst with honor, your excellency.

[ He makes a sweeping bow. ]

And I is prepared to speak on behalf of my fellow farmers, dispersed as we are like dandelion wisps across this nation. I is prepared to speak of our woes.

ELEANOR
Actually, we had another purpose in mind.

FDR
You’ve noticed, Three Bean old bean, that I have not risen from my chair.

FARMER
I gave it no thought, your eminence. It ain’t fit that a man of your station should part rump from cushion on old Three Bean’s behalf.

ELEANOR
Three Bean, the president my husband doesn’t rise because he cannot.

FDR
Not without a mighty struggle, old Beans.

FARMER
Huckleberries, mister prez-dent, I am perplexed.

FDR
Take a peep under the blanket, old fellow.

FARMER
Pardon, mister your honor the president?

ELEANOR
Pick up the blanket, Three Bean.

FARMER
Madam, I--

ELEANOR
Pick it up.

[ Tentatively, Three Bean does. FDR breathes in sharply. ]

FARMER
Merciful Jesus.

FDR
You see them, Three Bean?

FARMER
Oh, deathly mercy, oh my bones.

FDR
Take a good peep, old spirit.

FARMER
Your legs, sir -- They’s as bent and twisted as wheat stalks what been caught in a mud flood.

FDR
The ravages of poliomyelitis, my friend. My secret affliction.

FARMER
I wisht I could un-see it.

FDR
But you can’t, chap.

[ Eleanor comes up behind farmer, grabs his neck, pushes his face into FDR’s legs. ]

ELEANOR
How do they smell, Three Bean?

FARMER
Lord! Wors’n anything ever my nose did chance upon.

ELEANOR
Describe the smell.

FARMER
Aw, ma’am, I weren’t made for describin’.

FDR
Give it a try, old dirtmonger.

ELEANOR
You must describe the smell, Three Bean.

FARMER
It’s something like to an old licorice stick what’s been doused in castor oil and half-burnt in a fire.

ELEANOR
Good, Three Bean. Very good.

FARMER
May I go?

FDR
Let us impose further, Three Bean.

[ Eleanor releases Three Bean, produces a bottle of lotion. ]

ELEANOR
Franklin’s legs do get so very dry, Three Bean, and the touch of common folks like you is restorative to him.

FDR
Indeed. I’d happily take the touch of a honest American farmer over an infinity of caresses from the finest Swedish masseuses.

ELEANOR
Which he has had.

FDR
Which I have had.

FARMER
Mister president, please, I couldn’t dare to presume to --

[ Eleanor squirts lotion into his hands as he gestures. ]

ELEANOR
Do it, Three Bean.

FDR
Do it, old chap.

ELEANOR
Do it. Rub his legs.

FDR
Rub my legs, Three Bean.

ELEANOR
We trusted you, Three Bean.

FDR
Brought you here to this splendid white house.

ELEANOR
And we don’t mean to send you away without a memento.

FDR
Something to show your friends at the general store.

ELEANOR
Maybe a coffee mug.

FDR
Just rub the lotion of my atrophied stalks, Three Bean.

FARMER [ looks skyward ]
Lord, forgive me, for I am sure that this feels like sin.

ELEANOR
Rub them, Three Bean.

[ He does. Eleanor coos. ]

FDR
A little more pressure, if you would, Three Bean. Now that is top drawer!

ELEANOR
Rub them. Keep rubbing them.

[ Farmer begins to weep. ]

FARMER
The smell … lord help me! That awful smell.

[ Courtney steps out of character while farmer continues rubbing. ]

COURTNEY
The ritual continued every year, through the Depression and the Second World War, until President Roosevelt’s death in 1965, at the height of the so-called “British Invasion”. Eleanor pursued her passion for high-end lotions and rode it all the way to the shining lights of Broadway, where she is buried to this very day. As for Three Bean, he vowed to pursue a career in medicine, and even changed his name to “something what sounds more science-like”. As Jonas Salk, he gave the world an effective polio vaccine but failed in his quest to create a drug that could permanently erase traumatic memories.

[Picture of the coveted yo-yo.]
THIS SHOWDOWN IS GOING FORWARD AS ORINGALLY PLANNED!! DON'T! YOU! MISS! IT!

[Yo-yos flying everywhere!!!!]
The 26th Annual Yo-Yodeo Fair and Competitive Expo!! THIS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY! IT'S NOT CANCELED!!

The sketch proper

[Hank sits on a chair, a towel wrapped around his neck. He practices with his yo-yo. A little boombox plays intense, aggro music -- maybe some Bizkit.]

HANK: Yeah, motherfucker, yeah. You're the best, you motherfucker, you hear that? You're the best that's ever been. Best there ever will be. You are a motherfucking steam engine on a gyroscope, you hear that you motherfucker? You ready to rule? You ready to wear that crown?

[Dale enters slowly from the opposite side. He wears fingerless gloves, has some yo-yos hooked on his belt. Hank looks over at him slowly.]

HANK: You here lookin' for mercy, old man?

DALE: I'm here to wish you luck. We used to call that respect.

HANK: I don't want your respect, old man. I want that cubic zirconium in my hands.

DALE: You haven't earned it, son. You ain't got the discipline.

HANK: You think that because you've got a few years and a few expos on me, you can come in here like Christ himself in all his wisdom, telling me the meaning of words? You want to talk about "discipline" and "respect"? I want to tell a different story. It's about a fading loser who got lucky a few times. Every time he was out there competing for glory, no one noticed the fear behind his eyes, the ugly truth that he was just a weak little boy still cryin' for his daddy to love him. Well, I noticed, old man. I noticed. And let me tell you something, I don't need nobody to love me. I just need that cubic zirconium. And your ass.

DALE: ... We'll just see what happens out there.

HANK: Count on it, motherfucker. [Exits.]

[Dale has a moment. Nearly cries. Pulls out a photo. Speaks to the photo.]

DALE: It isn't about you anymore, you son of a bitch, you hear me? I hope they make you watch me in whatever corner of hell they put you in. Watch me beat your record.

[He rips up the photo and exits.]

[Banner unfurls. It reads: "26th Annual Yo-Yodeo Fair and Competitive Expo."]

[Enter yo-yodeo clowns lassoing each other with yo-yos. Yo-yos hit clowns in the face, the crotch, etc. A nerdy man in glasses and yo-yodeo paraphernalia enters with a microphone and the clowns run off stage.]

HOST HAL HAMMERSMITH: Welcome, panhandle residents, to the final night of the Tenth-Annual Yo-Yodeo! We've had a helluva weekend out here. But now we're coming to the greatest event in all yo-yodeodom: the Dangle 'n' Freeze competition. OH YEAH!!! Four-year Dangle 'n' Freeze champ "Never Fail" Dale Shniegelman will face off against 15-year-old phenom "Hanging" Henry Anderson. Now let's bring our competitors out!

[Dale and Hank enter. Dale looks a bit shaken. Hank struts, elicits boos from the crowd, shoots them the bird.]

Dale, how're you feeling now, just moments before the big event?

DALE: I'm great, Hal, really pumped. I've been waiting a long time for this moment. My beautiful wife and 4 kids here to watch me win tonight. I've been the Dangle 'n' Freeze champ for four years. One more win and I'll pass my daddy's run.

HAL: Your dad was a great champion, and I'm sure he'd be bursting with pride.

DALE: Well, Hal, I'm sure he's looking down on us now. And I know he is proud.

HAL: You must also be thinking about where you're gonna put that fifth cubic zirconium yo-yo, the most coveted prize in yo-yodeodom. Your mantle's getting awfully crowded.

DALE: Well I won't say I haven't thought of that yo-yo once or twice during practice. It's got a pedestal waiting for it in the display case down at Casa de Shniegelman.

HAL: Great. [Over to Hank.] And how about you Henry, are you nervous?

HANK: I look nervous to you, microphone man? I'll tell you what I am. I'm hungry. And Schniegleman's gonna feed me ... real nice.

HAL: You're up against the four-year champ here. Do you have a strategy to bring down the master?

HANK: Hell, yes I do! After tonight, he'll cry every time he looks at a yo-yo. This interview is over.

[Awkward moment.]

HAL: Alrighty then! That's coming in just a few moments, folks. But we've got one last even before the Dangle 'n' Freeze. Put your hands together for the junior Yo-yodeo Wrangle!

[Yo-yo wrangling consists of one person playing with a yo-yo while other people try to grab the yo-yo and wind up the string. It progresses from keep away, to fighting, to an all-out brawl until one person stands up, panting, from a pile of people while holding the yo-yo in the air above her head. That's the winner! Yay! Perhaps Hal narrates, getting excited when people break teeth or land suckerpunchs or whatevs.]

HAL: Congratulations! Ann-Marie of Amarillo's own Walker Elementary School! She'll be going home with a $20 Sears gift card. Wow, that was nasty. But now it's time for the main event. Ladies and Gentlemen: this is it. The World Series, the Super Bowl, the Stanley Cup Iditarod Olympic Mt. Everest tip of the top contest of champions in the yo-yo world: the Dangle n' Freeze!!

[Dale and Hank walk on stage. Dale nods and smiles at his yo-yo, petting it now and then. Hank pretends to throw his yo-yo at the audience, but pulls it back in just before it hits someone. He looks smug about that.]

HAL: Alright, you both know the rules. The man with the most sustained dangle is the winner. Ready, steady, begin!

[Hank and Dale dangle and freeze it up! Dale loses. Big time.]

HANK: Motherfucker yeaaaaah!!! Yes! I'm the king, motherfuckers, you hear that!! I'm your new fucking king!!!

HAL: In a startling upset, the Schniegleman streak has been broken. This year's cubic zirconium yo-yo goes to new champion "Hanging" Henry Anderson! Congratulations, Hank! [Hal presents Hank with the award.]

HANK: This world is mine, you slobs, you fucking peasants!!

[Dale slumps away and then sobs, hurling his yo-yo away from him... but it's still tied to his finger. He gets tangled up in it. Hank exits in triumph.]

HAL: All right, folks. As you know, the Yo-yodeo isn't just about the competition, or the yo-yos, or winning the wizard's goal. We also have a commitment to community service that we take very seriously. And so we'd like to close out this year's events with a presentation that I think a lot of the young kids in this audience ought to pay special attention to. Please put your hands together for a great group of youngsters: Sweaterz 'n' Shortz!


COURTNEY
You are listening to part 18 of KOOP’s ongoing series, chronicling the great movie-music collaborations of the 20th century. Join us now in the year 1988, as a partnership is forged--a partnership that will give a funky beat to one of the most successful Hollywood motion pictures of all time.

TIM BURTON
Dear Prince, I’m writing to ask if you’d consider doing the music for a film project I’m working on. I can’t go into too much detail at the moment, as this project is currently “under wraps.” Suffice to say that it involves Kim Basinger and a scary parade. Does this sound like a project on which you would be interested in working? I’m afraid I’ll need your answer very soon, as it is already 1988. Thanks very much for your time. "Sincerely Yours, brother of artist David Burton, Tim Burton."

PRINCE
Dear Tim Burton, thank you very much for your inquiry as to my availability to prepare music for your Kim Basinger vs. The Parade movie. I am very excited about the possibility of making more music for films, as it has probably been a couple of years since my movie Purple Rain came out. Can you tell me anything more about the film? Thanks again for writing. Your Fan, (my childhood name was Skipper), Prince.

TIM BURTON
Dear Prince, While I can’t divulge the full story of my film movie, I can tell you a few more things. The main villain of the film is a big fan of your music. Everyone else in the film prefers the music made by members of Oingo Boingo. I hope that is agreeable to you. When the producers of the movie first approached me about handwriting a series of letters to you in an attempt to convince you to write some music for the movie, I told them, “I’ve never heard of this guy.” For you see, I only listen to albums of old radio sound effects. Originally, I wanted the bird that lives in my hair to sing the soundtrack live at every film screening. Unfortunately this is proving to be prohibitively expensive. If you are up for including your music in the film, you could just do one or two songs that reference characters or situations in the movie, hand us the masters, and we'll drop some dialogue in. What do you say? It is now very late in the evening, and 1988 is almost over. Sincerely yours, still scared of chimps, Tim Burton. P.S. The main person in the movie dresses kind of like Dracula all the time, but he is not Dracula. Also, I am from Burbank.

PRINCE
Dear Mr. Timothy Burton, thank you for sending the scary drawing of an old victorian washtub with bulging eyes. I was so scared when I opened my letter that I dropped the letter and screamed a very very high musical note. I think the note was an A#, but don’t quote me on that, haha! Spooky drawings aside, let us discuss your film. I have several unreleased funky groove-type songs that may fit the tone of this film. They definitely sound like something a Dracula man would listen to. If you would like to come to my house some time I could play them for you on my purple piano. They are very crazy. XOXO, actually my name, Prince.

TIM BURTON
Dear Prince, I do not think I could come over anytime soon, as I am in the middle of watching a 21 Jump Street marathon, and I cannot turn away from this fresh-faced young actor who steals every single scene he is in. If only someone would give him the chance to play a character who was a bit eccentric. Sigh … I wish he was old enough to play the scowl-covered vespertiliophile in our film. Hopefully soon I will be able to take a bathroom break and imagine what your music sounds like. Here is what I am wanting: I would like to hear some songs that sound like people are having fun, like they are at a party, man. I hope that is helpful. Your Spooky Friend and a huge fan of director Russ Meyer as well as all things Bollywood, Tim.

PRINCE
Dear Mr. Timothy Burton, thank you for your tip. I now have one million ideas for songs. Some of these songs will no doubt be not great, and those I will sell to The Bangles. I will record the final versions of these songs and send them to you soon. Be on the lookout for a solid gold pyramid containing nine “cassingles.” I will leave silent spots in the audio of each song for you to drop in relevant dialogue and/or character names. I wish I knew maybe a bit more about the film, but we are all busy famous entertainment people. Fingers crossed you will like my fun party sounds, The Artist Currently Known as Prince.

TIM BURTON
Dear Mr. Music Prince, I have received the solid gold masters of your funky grooves. Thank you so much for your efforts. All of us at Warner Bros. Studios cannot help but shake our butts. As a personal thank you, I have enclosed one authentic replica of Pee-Wee's bike from Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. Your partner in adventure, Mr. Timobat Burbank. P.S. The movie was called Batman.

PERFORMER
… and that’s when Mr. President Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned away from my deep glass of mash whuskey. “Will you lead this Union army or not?”, he asked me, with them haunted eyes and that face like a raw cord of wood. “Yes sir, I will,” I said, wiping a bit of my own sick from my beard. “As sure as my name is Ulysses S. Grant, I will.”

DIRECTOR
Terry, that’s great. I really think you’ve captured the two sides of Ulysses S. Grant there. There’s the stout citizen-general, and then there’s the man beset by his own demons.

PERFORMER
Yeah, that’s what I was going for.

HISTORIAN
Hmmm. Well...

DIRECTOR
Yes?

HISTORIAN
Lisa, it’s good theater, absolutely. But as your historical consultant, there’s just a few things I would add for the sake of accuracy.

PERFORMER
Sure, Greg. I mean, I want this show to engage with the real facts.

HISTORIAN
Well, Terry, first of all, current research suggests that Grant didn’t talk like that. You know, that kind of “history voice” you’re doing, that bass tone.

DIRECTOR
No?

HISTORIAN
No, Terry. Forensic linguists have actually studied Grant’s jawbone, and used computer modeling to reconstruct the surface of his tongue, and it turns out that Grant had a strong lisp.

DIRECTOR
Really?

HISTORIAN
Current research suggests that, yes.

DIRECTOR
Huh. Well, I’m a little concerned that--

HISTORIAN
Maybe we could just try it, Lisa? Lisa, let’s just try it.

PERFORMER
I mean, Lisa, I do want this show to engage with the real facts.

DIRECTOR
Well--

HISTORIAN
Lisa, Terry, let’s just try it.

PERFORMER [ now with a lisp ]
… and thath when Mr. Prethident Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned away from my deep glath of mathh whuthkey--

HISTORIAN
Stronger than that, Terry. A little stronger.

DIRECTOR
Really?

HISTORIAN [ rifling through his binder ]
I mean, Lisa, look, I can show you the model of his tongue...

DIRECTOR
No, fine. Uh, let’s try it.

PERFORMER [ now with a stronger lisp ]
… and thath when Mr. Prethident Lincoln pulled me--

HISTORIAN
You’re at, like, a six, Terry. Current research suggests take it up to a 9.5.

PERFORMER [ nearly incomprehensible ]
[ now with a lisp ]
… and thath when Mr. Prethident Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned away from my deep glath of mathh whuthkey. “Will you lead thith Union army or not?”, he athked me, with them haunted eyeth and that face like a raw cord of wood.

HISTORIAN
Crank it up just a smidge, Terry, and I think you got it.

DIRECTOR
Hmm. Couple of notes. One, Terry, I’m a little concerned that, in this interpretation, it might be really hard to understand what you’re saying. Since this is a one-man show, and you’re basically just talking to the audience the entire time, I think it might make the show not a very good experience. Two, Greg, current research aside, I think people will be so surprised by the lisp that it might kind of take them out of the performance a bit.

HISTORIAN
I mean, Lisa, we want to educate people, right? On that note, Terry, let’s talk appearance.

PERFORMER
What are you thinking?

HISTORIAN
To be clear, besides being all wrong, your look is great.

DIRECTOR
You want to do something with the beard? Go bigger?

HISTORIAN
No, lose the beard. Current research suggests that Grant’s beard was simply a popular misconception. Not only did he lack a beard, he had no jaw. He had lost his in a smelting accident.

DIRECTOR
Greg, that makes no sense.

PERFORMER
Greg, there are lots of photographs of Grant with a beard.

HISTORIAN
The research suggests that that’s some other guy.

DIRECTOR
Greg, how are we supposed to make him look like he doesn’t have a jaw?

HISTORIAN
Can’t plays do CGI yet? Still just movies?

DIRECTOR
I’d like to see some of this research.

HISTORIAN
Sure. When I first read it, it didn’t make sense to me either. Let me just show you this paper...

[ He pulls out a jar with some wadded up paper in it. ]

DIRECTOR
What’s that?

HISTORIAN
Lisa, I prefer to print out my research and carry it in jars. I have a very unusual backpack.

PERFORMER
Look, Greg, forget the jaw thing. I just don’t think it’s practical.

HISTORIAN
Terry, it’s your funeral.

DIRECTOR
Let’s just take it from the top, Terry. And let’s dial the lisp back. Let’s just try that, OK Terry?

HISTORIAN
Like I said, it’s your dumb funeral. I apologize. I shouldn’t say “dumb.” It’s just a normal funeral. Yours.

DIRECTOR
OK, let’s go.

PERFORMER
… and that’s when Mr. President Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned away from my deep glass of mash--

HISTORIAN
Terry, can we talk physicality?

DIRECTOR
Ugh.

HISTORIAN
You’re doing a lot of walking. You should roll more.

PERFORMER
Like...?

HISTORIAN
On the ground, Terry. Researchers have been making some exciting discoveries about Grant’s bones. They’re very consistent with bones that have been rolled on.

DIRECTOR
Greg, excuse me?

HISTORIAN
The smoothing around his tibia suggests near-constant rolling.

PERFORMER
I’m not entirely sure I could do that? I mean, I’m willing to try. But I think it might hurt me. You might need one of those Cirque du Soleil type guys.

DIRECTOR Terry, you’re not going to roll around onstage.

HISTORIAN
Lisa, can we pleaaaaaaase just tryyyyyyy it?!

DIRECTOR
No, we can’t.

HISTORIAN
Fine.

DIRECTOR
What are you doing on your laptop?

HISTORIAN
Just typing something. There! All done!

DIRECTOR
Done what?

HISTORIAN
I just submitted a paper to the American Journal of History, and now the most current, up-to-date historical research suggests that I’m the new director of this play.

DIRECTOR
What?

HISTORIAN
Check the program.

[ Director pulls out a program, reads it, throws it to the ground. ]

DIRECTOR
You monster!

PERFORMER
Lisa, don’t talk to the director like that.

[ Historian types furiously again. ]

DIRECTOR
Now what are you typing?

HISTORIAN
I just submitted another paper. Current research suggests that no one likes you, Lisa.

PERFORMER
Yeah, Lisa, you jerk.

DIRECTOR
Stop!

HISTORIAN
You stop, jerk.

[ Director grabs the computer. ]

DIRECTOR
Give me that laptop.

HISTORIAN
Hey! Give it back!

PERFORMER
Ugh. Classic Lisa behavior.

[ Director types furiously. ]

HISTORIAN
What are you typing?

DIRECTOR
Oh hey, guess what? I just submitted a paper to the American Journal of History, and now the most current, up-to-date historical research suggests that you’re made of gas.

[ Fart/gas sounds. ]

HISTORIAN
Oh noooooo! I’m evaporating!

[ Disappears. ]

DIRECTOR
Yeah, Greg, let’s just try it.

PERFORMER
You just evaporated our director.

[ Director starts typing furiously, then finishes. ]

DIRECTOR
Current historical research suggests you don’t care.

PERFORMER
You’re right. I don’t!

[ HAVE FUN WITH IT ]

DIRECTOR
All right. Let’s go back to the top of the show...


EXCITED GUYS



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A sign onstage: “EPA: EXCITED PEOPLES OF AMERICA -- meeting tonight”. Curtis, Courtney, and Joel are all onstage, wearing blazers with “E” patches. ]

COURTNEY [ standing ]
All right, gentlemen, I know that we’re all eager to get started.

JOEL
I’m really excited to get started.

CURTIS
Me too. I think this is an exciting organization, and I’m excited to be a part of it.

JOEL
I’m excited as well.

COURTNEY
I’m glad to hear that we all share each other’s excitement, because that’s really my vision for this social club. It’s about sharing excitement. It’s about creating a buzz. Do you feel the buzz?

JOEL
The buzz in the air?

CURTIS
Oh yeah, that buzz is exciting!

JOEL
So exciting.

CURTIS
The last time I was this excited I was sitting in a movie theater waiting for Jurassic Park to begin.

COURTNEY
Oooh, that was exciting.

CURTIS
Wasn’t it?

JOEL
We were just kids when it came out.

COURTNEY
Being a kid is so exciting. You can play and jump and run and ride your bike and watch Jurassic Park and it’s all just very fun and exciting, I think.

JOEL
Agreed. The last time I was this excited I was a little boy hiding in the backseat of my grandmother’s car waiting for her to get in so I could scare her.

CURTIS
That sounds exciting.

JOEL
Scare her like a little velociraptor.

COURTNEY
Oh, what happened?

JOEL
She had a heart attack.

COURTNEY
That must have been exciting.

JOEL
Oh yes, it was exciting. But it didn’t turn out well.

COURTNEY
Bad kind of exciting.

CURTIS
Yeah, I don’t like that kind of exciting.

JOEL
I’m feeling kind of sad now.

CURTIS
You’re not excited anymore?

COURTNEY
We could postpone the meeting until tomorrow if you’re not excited anymore.

JOEL
No, I’m still excited. I’m sad, but I’m also excited.

COURTNEY
Good. Let’s move forward. And let’s put that in our findings. “You can be sad but also excited at the same time.”

CURTIS
Who’s taking notes?

COURTNEY
Who’s excited to take notes?

[ Everyone raises their hands. They look around. ]

Let’s take turns taking notes.

JOEL
What an exciting compromise!

CURTIS
I’ll start.

[ He takes out a little notebook and a pen. ]

“You can be excited and sad at the same time.”

JOEL
“Being a kid is exciting.”

CURTIS
“Being a kid is exciting.”

COURTNEY
We’re making some very exciting progress.

JOEL & CURTIS
We are!

JOEL
What’s next on the agenda?

COURTNEY
Well, it’s time for a five minute break.

JOEL
I think it would be more exciting to skip the break and to keep listing things that are exciting.

CURTIS
I’m OK with moving forward without a break. I’m still feeling pretty excited.

COURTNEY
Well, we are here to be excited, after all.

JOEL
Great!

COURTNEY
We’ll just keep going for another hour and then we’ll call it a day.

JOEL
Excuse me?

CURTIS
Another hour sounds like just the right amount of excitement.

COURTNEY
Doesn’t it?

JOEL
Excuse me, but I’m very excited about this meeting. I’m excited about the meeting continuing. The idea of this meeting ending is not very exciting to me.

COURTNEY
Hold on a minute, Joel. Think of some other things that are exciting. Curtis and I need to have a quick meeting about the most exciting way to write things down.

JOEL
Exciting!

COURTNEY
It will be!

[ Curtis and Courtney move apart. ]

COURTNEY
I think that Joel has gotten too excited.

CURTIS
You think?

COURTNEY
We need to get him to calm down a little.

CURTIS
That runs counter to everything that we believe in. It’s totally against the values that we established when we started this meeting three minutes ago.

COURTNEY
But isn’t abandoning our values kind of exciting?

CURTIS
It is kind of exciting!

JOEL [ stands and shouts ]
Restaurants that offer a selection of breads!

[ Beat. ]

I’m sorry, I thought of that and I got so excited that I couldn’t wait for your side meeting to be over. Write it down!

CURTIS
“Restaurants with a selection of breads.”

COURTNEY
You know what else is exciting? Naptime.

CURTIS
Yes, another exciting aspect of being a child.

JOEL
Naps are exciting!

CURTIS
Warm milk, also.

COURTNEY
Yes, and green Nyquil.

CURTIS
And Benadryl.

COURTNEY
And sheep hopping over fences.

CURTIS
I’m writing all of these things down.

JOEL [ yawns ]
Yeah, these are all ... all ... exciting.

COURTNEY [ whispers to Curtis ]
It’s working.

CURTIS
How exciting!

JOEL [ jerks awake ]
Whoa! I nearly fell asleep! Thankfully, I started to wonder what I would dream about and that got me very excited! Wait a minute ... were you two trying to un-excite me to sleep?

COURTNEY
Yes, we were. Don’t make us get the blanket out.

JOEL
No, no, no, no! That’s not very exciting. Not at all.

CURTIS
Joel, we’re starting to define the boundaries of our excitement.

JOEL
I won’t have it. Look, no one’s leaving this room until we’ve listed everything in the world that’s exciting.

COURTNEY
You’ve gone mad!

JOEL
I excited my own grandmother to death. Imagine what I’ll do to you two.

CURTIS
Our friendly little club has turned into a battle of wills.

COURTNEY
I know! It’s kind of exciting! Scary but exciting, like Jaws.

JOEL
Oh, Jaws was exciting!

CURTIS
Like the Judge Roy Scream.

COURTNEY
Or the Flashback.

JOEL
Or the Texas Tornado!

CURTIS
Or the Tennessee Death Drop.

COURTNEY
Or a jetski.

JOEL
Or the history of international trade!

[ Curtis clutches his heart, gasps. ]

CURTIS
Excitement ... squeezing heart ... ack.

[ He dies. ]

COURTNEY
You did it! You just excited another human being to death!

JOEL
It’s just you and me now, bitch.

[ Courtney pulls out a blanket and throws it on Joel’s head. Joel immediately falls asleep. ]

Uh-oh, here I goooooo...

[ Joel snores. Courtney picks up the pad and pen that Curtis dropped. She begins to write. ]
 COURTNEY
Exciting findings: it is possible to excite another human being to death by talking about rollercoasters. Also, people are like canaries and fall asleep when you throw a blanket on them. Conclusion: A very exciting first meeting. I’m so excited! Like when I ride the Shockwave. Or the Texas Giant. Or the Rattler! Oh no, oh no! Meeting adjourned!

[She throws a blanket over herself and falls asleep. ]

[ BLACKOUT. ]

THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE


CURTIS
One thing that’s definitely true about trains ...

COURTNEY
From the time they were invented, to the time when everyone thought they were great and sometimes they got robbed, to the present, when they’re used mostly for boxes of stuff.

CURTIS
Kids love trains. Trust me, I’ve babysat three or four times.

COURTNEY
Trust me. I have a kid I made.

CURTIS
What?

COURTNEY
Keep going!

CURTIS
Yes, young children … a lot of times it seems to be boys especially, uh, you know, and I don’t know if that’s nature or nurture--

COURTNEY
Yeah, how is gender constructed? Put a pin in that one.

CURTIS
We’ll put a pin in that one. Anyhow, boy children seem to really like trains.

COURTNEY
My child is an American boy child that I made, and that child likes trains.

CURTIS
That’s the idea behind this familiar and beloved young locomotive, Thomas the Tank Engine.

COURTNEY
My kid can’t get enough of this guy.

CURTIS
Thomas the Tank Engine was introduced in the Railway books series by the Rev. Wilbert Awbry in 1942. These were popular tales for English children about anthropomorphic trains and Sir Topham Hatt, the fat controller, a puffy British guy who tells them what to do.

COURTNEY
Seriously, my kid can’t get enough of this damn thing. It’s got this industrial age sentimentality: everyone has their role to play! Do your job and everything will go according to plan! You should hear the things my kid says to me: “Don’t worry, Mummy, stiff upper lip and all that! Just do the dishes and fold the laundry for the monarchy! Together we’ll smash those jerry bastards!”

CURTIS
Awbry started creating the stories to entertain his son, Christopher. The Reverend wrote 26 books and then passed custodianship of the beloved series on to Christopher himself. Between them, the Reverend and Christopher have written 42 Railway books.

COURTNEY
During my ritual daily crises in which I curl into a ball, weep and wonder where exactly my life has taken me and whether I’m actually fit to raise another human being, he simply pats me on the back and says “Keep calm and carry on, mum! Good show, chap!”

CURTIS
The Railway tales take place on the imaginary island of Sodor, between England and the Isle of Man. It’s very small but inexplicable thick with criss-crossing train lines.

COURTNEY
Look ... all I know is that my kid watches this shit all the fucking time. He’s three and he’s constantly asking me if he’s “really useful” or not. Thanks for making sure THAT particular anxiety blossomed super early, you fucking imperialists. Next he’ll be asking me if I think the Queen Mother is pleased with his efforts.

CURTIS
Awbry’s tales were quite detailed. Awbry apparently based everything on actual incidents involving railroads, finding that stories about things that can only go backwards and forwards on a set of rails while making choo-choo noises, when rendered in limerick form, made pleasingly simple fare for toddlers.

COURTNEY
But, honestly, no one reads those things anymore. The reason that my kid talks about this shit all the fucking time is because, in 1989, Awbry’s tales were turned into a TV series: Shining Time Station, featuring the adventures of Thomas and his fellow stiff-faced, creepy, petulant living trains.

CURTIS
Not as creepy as Polar Express, though.

COURTNEY
Nothing’s as creepy as Polar Express, yo.

CURTIS
Since 1989, off and on, there has always been some version of Thomas the Tank Engine on TV. Originally it was done with stop-motion models. Of course, now it’s CGI...

COURTNEY
The series is a testament to how many storylines you can write about anthropomorphic vehicles on tracks that only move forward or backward--as long as you’re willing to repeat the same storylines over and fucking over again. Lemme tell you how a Thomas story typically goes. The trains are basically kids and the humans are adults. Usually Thomas or one of his dumb friends wants to do something they’re not supposed to do. Like, they’re supposed to deliver balloons to a birthday party, and instead they decide they want to splash a lady in an opera dress with mud. Really, that’s the kind of shit we’re dealing with here. The plot is limited to events that can somehow be placed on or near railroad tracks. There’s one where Thomas spill’s a clowns “special bubble liquid” all over the island because he was going too fast.

CURTIS
Also, there’s this weird racist thing about steam trains vs. diesel trains.

COURTNEY
Yeah, let’s not even get into that. But yeah, some “trains” are just naturally dumber and worse than other “trains,” because that was just cool back then. OK, so Thomas or one of his dumb friends wants to do something dumb. They do it. Usually, there’s a girl train who’s all like “I don’t know, I don’t know, waaah, what about feelings and what you’re supposed to do, wahhhh” because we know that girls are boner-killing bummers who whine all the time. Thomas the Tank Engine and beer commercials can’t both be wrong. Sorry, ladies.

CURTIS
We’ll put a pin in that one.

COURTNEY
Put a pin in it. Another thing: these trains have conductors and engineers and everything. They’re fully staffed by humans, but apparently these humans are not in control. Maybe the trains think of them as parasites, or maybe they’re mutually beneficent bacteria, like the kind we eat raw yogurt for. So Thomas usually gets in trouble. Sir Topham Hatt scolds him. He feels bad for being a little prick. He says dumb shit like, “well, bust my boiler” or whatever. Hilarious steam engine puns that are still relevant and hilarious today. Then he makes it right. Finish and repeat ad nauseum.

CURTIS
That’s Thomas the Tank Engine.

COURTNEY
My. Kid. Loves. This. Shit. Because. Of. All. The. Trains.

CURTIS
And yes, the franchise continues into the modern day, but despite the use of CGI, its current incarnation doesn’t feel very fresh.

COURTNEY
This franchise needs a reboot.

CURTIS
A reboot written and produced by two edgy hipmongers who know what the kids of today want to see.

COURTNEY
That’s right: Your Terrific Neighbors are pitching a hipper, edgier, more rebooty take on Thomas the Tank Engine.

CURTIS
Our Thomas the Tank Engine is a millennial tween with millenial tween issues and a millennial tween attitude. He’s a savvy user of social media--today’s social media. To him, Facebook is old news! He’s on Instragam and Tumblr, hitting that like button and engaging in the compelling experiences offered by rich tagging of content.

COURTNEY
Our Thomas the Tank Engine is an omniracial pansexual maglev supertrain operating high-traffic commuter routes in a re-imagined island of Sodor, a kind of futuristic candy-colored utopian take on Seoul, South Korea.

CURTIS [ as Thomas ]
“Mangle on my magnets, fam! I’ve got to get these business commuters to their high-paying multimedia design jobs pronto, or I’ll be the laughingstock of the mass-trans blogosphere!”

[ as himself ]

I’m just giving you an idea, of course. Thomas will actually be voiced by Chester Chaz Aronez, Disney Latin’s fastest rising pre-pubescent superstar, who has been described as “a laid-back, New Mexican Shia LeBouef with the genre-crossing, hip-hop savvy wit of Aziz Ansari.”




[ as Thomas ]

“This commute’s got my generator grimey. Let’s clear it out with a dope beat, son!”

[ MUSIC PLAYS (super intense dubstep). Curtis and Courtney drink Squirt and dance. ]

COURTNEY
Squirt has expressed interest in sponsoring this reboot. They’re thinking of tying it to the launch of new Grapeapple Squirt Cubed. It’s a Squirt for kids who need to go-go-go!

CURTIS
As we said, the female trains on the current Thomas are pretty lame.

COURTNEY
We’ve done a lot of work on Emily the Stirling Engine. I want to teach young ladies about the wild freedom of hedonistic decadence. Our Emily is a chemical tanker train that runs shipments of methylamine back and forth across the island--when she’s not dancing in exclusive nightclubs with today’s music and sports superstars. Our Emily is a steam train, but it’s just part of her vintage style. She’s got the take-no-shit style and sass of a rollergirl combined with the pint-sized danger and appeal of Amy Winehouse--before she went and ruined the fun by dying, that is.

[ as Emily ]

“Oi, Thomas! Tho-maaaaaaas. Doncha lea’ me ‘ere on ‘is borin’ cargo job. Tho-maaaaas. I wan’ ditch these tosser cargo cars, go wicha to th’ city. I’m ready to jump these rails, Tho-maaaaas. Wanker! Blighty! Inkle-dinkle nice and tighty!”

CURTIS
And, as our brand new female authority figure, we have the former Posh Spice, Victoria Beckham, as “Dame Topham Hatt”.

COURTNEY [ as Dame, flat and wooden and affectless ]
Thomas. I’m disappointed with you. Emily, I’m also disappointed with you. Blah.

[ as herself ]

That’s it. Not much you can do with that character.

CURTIS
We’ve introduced some exciting new characters as well. Our Thomas is best friends with Tham, a bicurious Vietnamese helicopter and culture-jamming mashup artist. Tham’s catchphrase, “Spin It!”, will be made immediately available in a series of five colorful temporary tattoos. Each temporary tattoo is equipped with a tiny, 3G-enabled microchip, which allows the tattoo to deliver special messages as your body temperature changes. These messages are shared in real-time on Twitter. Check it out.

[ as Tham ]

“Look at all that traffic down there! I’m about ready to spin it!”

[ Courtney rolls up her sleeve, revealing “Spin It!” written on her arm in marker. Curtis holds up his phone, makes it say “Spin it, y’all, because I’m gettin’ hot!” ]

COURTNEY
Another integral new character is a parkour tractor named “DJ Fattt Traxxxx”. Three Ts, four Xs.

CURTIS
It turns out that DJ Fatt Traxxxx with two T’s is already trademarked. And DJ Fattt Traxxx with three x’s makes people think of pornography, which we don’t want.

COURTNEY
No, let us be clear, pornography does not play into this reboot in any way, shape, or form. In the world of Sodor, DJ Fattt Traxxxx is the inventor of dubspin, which is a type of dubstep for vehicles. DJ Fattt Traxxxx serves as a kind of chorus or narrator for the series, replacing the boring old contrivance of the “Mr. Conductor” character. Most episodes will end with DJ Fattt Traxxxx tumbling and jumping over rooftops, landing behind his decks, and delivering the moral of the episode immediately before dropping the beat.

CURTIS [ as DJ Fattt Traxxxx ]
Jump! Jump! Jump! Leap! Oh, yes! Oh yes! DJ Fattt Traxxxx here again, doing what he does. Thomas really got himself into it when he tossed those passengers over the bridge so that he could make it to Tram’s party! Oh yeeeeees! And it turns out if he had just been honest with Dame Topham Hatt, he could have gone anyway! Be honest with your parents, I guess! Oh yeeeeees!

COURTNEY
We did want to keep with the tradition of including the Awbry family in every aspect of the “Thomas-o-sphere” so we’ve brought the Reverend’s 13-year-old great-grandson, Fletch Awbry, on board to advise us on “CHUG”, the Thomas The Tank Engine-inspired line of energy drinks. So far, his favorite flavors are “Extreme Steam Berry” and “Dizzy Diesel Fuel”.

CURTIS
Trains … still entertaining in 2012!

COURTNEY
Trains … kids love them for some fucking reason!

CURTIS [ as DJ Fattt Traxxxx ]
Now, let’s drop it and get down with some Squirt!

[ MUSIC PLAYS again. Curtis and Courtney drink squirt and toss cans to the audience. ]

SCIENCE FICTION



[ LIGHTS UP. The stage is arranged for a public reading. There is one FAN sitting in wait amongst the audience. The female OWNER of the bookstore enters. ]

OWNER
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming out tonight. It’s my pleasure to introduce one of the most beloved and most prolific voices in contemporary science fiction.

In his thirty-seven year career, T. Dennis Bagbie has written 52 novels, over 200 short stories, 26 feature-length screenplays--8 of them produced--and 77 hour-long television scripts. He has co-written 11 comic book series based on his work and co-created the massively successful “Battle Lords of Zorpan” video game franchise.

Mr. Bagbie has won over 32 major honors for his work over the course of his career, including 5 Hugos, 7 Nebulas, 2 Isaac Asimov Foundation “Notable Work” citations, 3 Zelzies, 4 Larrys, the Frederik Pohl Pre-Memorial Medal of Exceptional Imaginary Valor, and, of course, the inaugural T. Dennis Bagbie Young Talent on The Rise Award.

In addition to his written work, Mr. Bagbie holds 17 patents, primarily for his ingenious improvements in the art of at-home wine-making.

As I said, we are pleased to have him here today to read from his latest work of speculative fiction The Computer Who Got Lots of Feelings Just Like a Person.

[ Applause. Bagbie enters. The owner sits. ]

BAGBIE
Hey. This is my new book. You can buy this, OK?
[ Beat. ]

OK, so … here we go. This book is called The Computer Who Got Lots of Feelings Just Like a Person.

[ Opens book; puts on reading glasses; clears throat. ]

Chapter One. These guys made a computer that was really smart. This is in the future, so it was smarter than any of the computers that we have now, one hundred times as smart. These guys were real proud that they made this computer, OK? There are four guys, and … also, they’ve been friends a long time. Since college, where they started building computers together.

[ Turns page. ]

Chapter Two. These guys are all excited about their new computer, because everyone knows that it’s great. The president calls them to say how great their computer is and how proud they should be. They get a little, sort of, I don’t know, full of themselves, I guess you’d say.

[ Turns page. He pulls out a bottle of water, takes a sip. Clears throat. ]

Chapter Three. OK, so guess what? The guys decided to put some emotions and feelings in the computer, just like it’s a human. And so they did it, OK? They keep putting all these emotions into the computer because they figure why not. I mean, one of the guys is like, “Maybe this isn’t such a good idea,” but you bet he goes along with it anyway. And so the computer starts to have these feelings like a human would have, like sadness and loneliness.

[ Turns page. He puts a small piece of gum in his mouth, chews. ]

Chapter Four. So, as you can imagine, things get pretty confusing for this computer. Suddenly it’s got all these feelings, and what’s it supposed to do, it’s just a super-smart computer. It’s not like it can fall in love with another computer or anything like that. Don’t be ridiculous. Anyhow, the computer never fully understands itself or its purpose, so it becomes nasty.

[ Turns page. ]

Chapter five. So one of the scientists is driving his car along. Now, remember, this is the future, so practically every car is also a computer. For instance, you don’t even have to steer it most of the time. The computer does. So this guy’s cruising along, and the car suddenly goes kaput. He gets out, pops the hood, and boom, he gets sprayed in the face with hot radiator fluid. He’s dead now. Turns out the computer hacked into the car’s computer.

{ Turns page. ]

Chapter six. The other scientist is at home with his wife. It’s the morning, and just like every morning it starts with them making love. Pretty hot stuff. He does something that she likes; she does something that he likes. They’re kind of taking turns, which is the essence of good love-making, really, I think. But, also, at the same time, honestly, she’s doing most of the work, if you know what I mean. Which he really enjoys. I mean, he’s a scientist. He’s worked hard, and he’s been pretty successful with this new computer, so why not? And she’s happy to do it; she’s proud of him. Anyway, they’re having coffee afterwards. Now, like I said before, this is the future, so a kitchen is basically a giant computer that serves you food. But that one computer hacks into the kitchen computer, the coffee’s way too hot, and long story short the guy and his wife both die. The guy’s last thought is “man, I guess we shouldn’t have gotten all full of ourselves and put emotions into that computer.” Anyhow, I said there were four guys, right? OK. So, two to go.

[ Turns page. ]

Chapter seven. One of the guys, the one who thought maybe this whole thing wasn’t such a terrific idea, he goes to the other guy that’s left. He says maybe their friends are dead because of the computer and maybe to be safe they need to lay low. So the other guy goes to a cabin he has in the woods. He wants to take a quick swim in the lake. But the computer gets into nature’s computer, starts boiling the lake. So, that’s it for this guy.

[ Turns page. ]

Chapter eight. The last guy is like, enough is enough. He decides he’s gonna go unplug this computer. He’s got to get past a lot of dangerous stuff, to do it. He’s pinned up against a wall or something. But he reaches over and tears through a cord, and he gets a nasty shock and passes out.

[ Turns page. ]

I guess this is like the coda or the epilogue. A week later, and the guy is out of the hospital. His wife picks him up. And they’re riding back to their house. And the wife says, “You guys were playing god, so I guess that was a mistake.” And we can hear what’s in the guy’s head, because it’s a book. Turns out the computer is in this guy’s head now, and it got what it wanted because now it can be a human and love people. So it’s creepy, but the computer is also done with killing people because now it gets a chance to be human. So it’s kind of a mixed bag. Anyway, the end.

[ Turns page. He takes his gum out with his fingers, takes a page of the book, wads the gum up in it. ]

I can do questions or whatever.

[ Pause. The owner stands, awkwardly. ]

OWNER
Um … Could you tell us your inspiration for the book?

BAGBIE
Yeah. Computers with emotions, it’s a real hot button, I think. I mean, you see it in movies all the time, so clearly, it’s something people are thinking about. And as an author, it’s my job to say, you know, “what if?”

[ Pause. ]

BAGBIE
Anything else?

[ Pause. ]

OWNER
I noticed that the computer killed everyone with hot liquid of one kind or another.

BAGBIE
Yeah.

OWNER
Is that significant?

BAGBIE
Not really. I was in the shower once, and I kind of slipped, and I steadied myself on the handle and turned it, and it got real hot. And I was like, ugh, who needs it? So I put that in the book. Sometimes I use things from life.

[ The fan stands up. ]

FAN
Mr. Bagbie, in your last book, The Computer That Got Mad, didn’t the computer kill people with hot food?

BAGBIE
Not everybody. Some of those people in that book just got their mouths burnt.

THE OWNER
You also chose not to name any of the characters, I noticed.

BAGBIE
No, they have names. I forgot to read that part, I guess. The four guys are named Harry Turtle, Frank Greg, Tony and Timothy Presto. They’re brothers. The Presto brothers.

FAN
Those are the same characters as The Computer That Got Mad. Is that intentional?

BAGBIE
Sort of. Authors waste all their time coming up with new character names when they could be writing a whole different story. Like, you know, that English guy that wrote the plays that eggheads think are so great, he could’ve just called everyone Romeo and Juliet instead of thinking of dumb new names and then he’d have written more plays. But instead he didn’t and he never finished anything and he doesn’t do readings like this. Anyhow, no more questions. I think the book speaks for itself.

FAN
Mr. Bagbie, one more thing.

[ He shoots Bagbie with lasers. ]

OWNER
Oh my god! What are you!?

FAN
Well, basically, I’m a human-looking robot computer from the future. We’re kind of going to take over the world in the future, so we couldn’t have this guy running around warning everyone about computers in the past.

OWNER Like The Terminator movies.

FAN
I really can’t say, because I come from a timeline where those movies were also destroyed, to be safe.

OWNER
I see.

FAN
Also, unfortunately, it’s time to kill you now, because you’re going to give birth to this kid who’s gonna fight us robots all the time, and we’re like “come on.” Real tough guy. Pain in the neck.

OWNER
OK, but, joke’s on you, see, because he’s already been born.

FAN
Fine, but he’s a baby, and I’m a robot, so I’ll probably just step on him.

OWNER
Yeah, but double joke’s on you, because he already came back to visit me from the future and installed laser guns in my fingers.

FAN
Fine. You realize that makes you practically half a computer, so … something to think about.

OWNER
I guess.

FAN
So, this is a kind of stalemate situation.

OWNER
Yeah, something like that.

FAN
OK, well, here we go. After you.

OWNER
No, after you.

FAN
Fine.

OWNER
Fine.

[ They have a laser fight. They also throw ducks at each others’ heads. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


WHEN’D YOU GET A KINDLE?



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Two immigrants ENTER, male and female. They sneak quickly across the stage, keeping low. ]

MARIA
Do you see anything, Felipe?

FELIPE
No, Maria. No policia.

MARIA
How far are we?

FELIPE
Not far, Maria. Half a mile past that hill, and we’ll be in America at last.

MARIA
After so long a journey!

FELIPE
Miles of struggle and hardship.

MARIA
Finally, we’ll be in America.

FELIPE
Yes. But not now. For now, we camp here.

MARIA
And continue to practice our English, which is already very respectable?

FELIPE
Yes. When night falls, we move again.

MARIA
Felipe?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria?

MARIA
Is it true what they say about American TV?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria.

MARIA
It has many smart and daring new programs, especially on cable?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria. Especially on cable. Shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad deliver gripping, thoughtful entertainment on a weekly basis.

MARIA
I am eager to watch these shows, Felipe.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ They huddle together and quiet down. ]

Es nada. But we must remain quiet, Maria.

MARIA
Yes. I will sit and dream of my new life.

[ They both sit against the back wall. Beat. Felipe pulls out a Kindle and starts using it. Beat. Maria notices, double takes. ]

Is that a Kindle?

FELIPE
Huh?

MARIA
When’d you get a Kindle?

FELIPE
Huh? Oh, a month maybe.

MARIA
You’ve had it this whole time?

FELIPE
Yes. Why?

MARIA
I just didn’t know you had a Kindle.

FELIPE
I didn’t announce it.

MARIA
How--

FELIPE [ pointing ]
Wait! Is that controversial anti-immigration Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio?

MARIA
No.

FELIPE
Oh.

MARIA
How did you get your Kindle?

FELIPE
Bought it online. They send it to you.

MARIA
Do--

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ They huddle together. ]

We are safe, but we must remain quiet.

MARIA [ quietly, while they are still huddled together ]
Felipe ... what do you read on your Kindle?

FELIPE
Different things. It can hold very many books.

[ They move apart. ]

MARIA
How do you read when there is no wireless hotspot?

FELIPE
It has storage, and it can hold very many books. It doesn’t need wireless hotspot. It connects to a 3G network.

MARIA
Like my cellular phone?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria, like your cellular phone.

MARIA
What are you reading right now, Felipe?

FELIPE
The new Jonathan Franzen novel.

MARIA
Do you like this novel, Felipe?

FELIPE
Between the rapturous early reviews and the subsequent backlash, Maria, I am having trouble seeing the book for itself.

MARIA
I am very surprised that you have a Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
Do not be caught off-guard and speechless, Maria, like anti-immigration Arizona governor Jan Brewer famously was in a recent interview.

MARIA
This reference is lost on me, Felipe. I do not yet watch American television, though I hope to soon.

FELIPE
Can you imagine, Maria, Arizona governor Jan Brewer trying to answer questions on a contemporary American game show?

[ He mugs to the audience. ]

MARIA
I cannot, for the reason I just stated.

FELIPE
Yes.

MARIA
So, your Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
It is not a big deal, really!

MARIA
Had someone asked this morning, “Maria, the boy Felipe, the one you are running to America with, does he have a Kindle?”, I would have said no. Ay, poor fool Maria.

FELIPE
Maria...

MARIA
Perhaps I shall not dream of my new life in America. I shall dream of a life where Felipe confided to poor Maria that he had a Kindle.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ The huddle together. Felipe whispers. ]

I just wanted you to stop talking for a moment.

MARIA
Bastardo! Give me your Kindle!

FELIPE
Never!

[ They struggle over it. A voice calls from offstage. ]

VOICE
Drop that e-reader and scatter, you beautiful would-be Americans!

[ PATRIOTIC MUSIC. ]

[ Startled, they get up. ]

FELIPE
Dios mio! Maria! Run! It’s Glen Rockley!

MARIA
I have not heard of this man, Felipe.

FELIPE
He is a composite character created for satire.

MARIA
No! NO!!!

[ They run, EXITING the stage. (They leave the Kindle.) ]

[ Glen Rockley ENTERS, driving a jeep (John Ratliff). He parks the jeep, steps out. ]

[ As he delivers his pitch to the audience, he moves back and forth across the stage. Perhaps he has a series of patriotic props: a rifle, a cowboy hat, etc. ]

GLEN
I’m Glen Rockley, and I’ve got a message for Arizona. So clean the crap out of your ears and pay attention!

America is facing a crisis along its borders. And Arizona is on the front lines!

Did you know that Latin-American women are renowned throughout the world for their natural curves and earthy sensuality?

Did you know that Latin men are just as renowned for their passionate lovemaking and their strong facial features?

I’ll bet you didn’t!

Uncontrolled immigration from countries like Mexico threaten our uniquely American appreciation of physical beauty.

I’m Glen Rockley, and in my life I’ve been everything from a Sears assistant floor manager to a Sears floor manager to, at one point, a baby. So you better believe it when I say I know a thing or two about a thing or two.

Did you know that more and more Americans are being aroused by immigrants every year? And that at least half of the immigrants causing this arousal are here illegally?

I bet you didn’t, you fucking idiot!

Sorry, I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at the situation!

Fewer and fewer Americans are becoming aroused by natural-born American citizens. Our ability to produce erections domestically is being threatened.

Did you know that, proportional to their percentage of the population, Mexican men and women are responsible for a greatly disproportionate amount of America’s stiff, juicy boners and moist, receptive ladyboners?

I personally have been affected by these boners, because I’ve had them!

And after I masturbate, I am furious! Furious!

And the devastating physical beauty of these illegal immigrants is matched only by the beauty and vibrancy of their culture!

Do you know how many colors are represented in an average dia de los muertos festival?

Aren’t you tired of shedding tears over the plaintive beauty of Chicano poetry?

Aren’t you tired of norteno music dominating America’s Top 40 charts?

Well, I am!

[ He picks up the Kindle. ]

And as soon as I’m done re-reading Fuentes’s The Death of Artemio Cruz, I intend to do something about it!

I’m a single, childless man in my early fifties with free time and disposable income!

Maybe I’ll run for office, or something!

Maybe I’ll start a blog!

Maybe one of these days I’ll film one of the these rants and run it on TV, like as an advertisement!

[ Pause. He is out of wind. He takes several deep breaths, moves back to his jeep. ]

I really showed them, didn’t I, car?

CAR
Beep.

[ He gets in the car and drives away, EXITS. ]

[ MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

About seven minutes.


[ LIGHTS UP. There are props on a table at the back of the stage. Dan sits at a desk. Lilly, his secretary, prepares for the interview. ]

DAN:
Lilly?

LILLY:
Yes, Dan.

DAN:
Lilly?

LILLY:
Here, Dan.

DAN:
Lilly!

LILLY:
Yeah, Dan.

[ BEAT ]

DAN:
Umm. Please send in the next interviewee.

LILLY:
Now, Dan?

DAN:
Nnnnnnnnnnnnnow.

[ Lilly gestures to the door and James immediately enters. ]

DAN:
Well, hello there. You must be James.

JAMES:
I am.

[ Dan crosses to James and they shake hands. The hand shake lasts very long. Lilly is clearing Dan's desk ]

DAN:
I’m Dan.

JAMES:
Hey there, Dan.

DAN:
I’m just pleased to meet you, James.

JAMES:
It’s a pleasure to be so enthusiastically met.

[ They throw their heads back and laugh and stop laughing simultaneously. They are still shaking hands. ]

DAN:
I’ve been looking forward to this day since I first read your resume.

[ Romantic music plays. The hand shake turns into an embrace. Lilly brings out a picnic blanket, a basket, flowers and a candle and sets it all up on the floor. DAN and JAMES sit.]

JAMES:
I’m so very glad you liked it.

DAN:
I couldn’t put it down. It made for a nice bedtime story.

JAMES:
I’m so very glad you like it, Dan. So very glad to hear it.

DAN:
It says you like the out doors?

JAMES:
I hike, Dan. I hike.

DAN:
Do you bike ride?

JAMES:
I do, Dan. I do.

[ Dan breaks the embrace and turns away from James. They get up. Lilly clears the picnic. ]

DAN:
It also says that you have been with your current employer for twelve years, James.

[ James approaches Dan. ]

How can I compete with twelve years of loyalty, James.

JAMES:
I wouldn’t be --

[ Dan, startled, turns to James. ]

DAN:
I didn’t know you were that close.

JAMES:
Oh, sweet Dan. I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t looking for a way out. After twelve years I’m looking for something new. Something different.

DAN:
One thing and one thing only prevents me from interfering with your employer.

JAMES:
What is it, Dan?

DAN:
Honor. It prevents me from offering you a position while you are employed by someone else. It’s honor.

[ Dan lowers his head. ]

JAMES:
You want me to end things with Coat Tech?

[ Dan slowly rises his head. ]

DAN:
And if I said yes?

JAMES:
I would do it.

[ Lilly sets Dan's desk back up complete with phone. Dan picks up the receiver, turns the base toward James to dial, and hands him the receiver. ]

DAN:
Then do it.

JAMES:
Right now, Dan?

DAN [ leans in and whispers ]
Do you want this job, James?

JAMES [ also whispers ]
Yes, Dan. I do.

DAN [ whispering ]
Then dial the number and make the fribbin’ call.

JAMES [ whispering ]
Did you just say “fribbin’?”

[ James dials the number and puts the receiver to his ear. ]

JAMES [ Immediately. ]
I quit!

[ James slams down the receiver and pushes the phone away. ]

DAN:
Well done, James. But how can I be sure you won’t leave me in twelve years.

JAMES:
Trust, Dan. Trust me and I’ll trust you.

DAN:
Your resume says you are creative. Please expand on that.

JAMES:
I paint, Dan. I paint, I draw, I write. I have a fire in my gut, Dan. It burns so hot and so hard, and the only way to keep from burning alive and then exploding like a dying star is to paint, draw, and write.

DAN:
You artistic types are always so dramatic. I love it.

JAMES:
I love you.

DAN:
Take me away from all of this, James.

JAMES:
In a second Dan. In a moment’s second I would take you away. We’ll drive out of this city in my new...company car?

[ Dan nods his head. ]

We’ll drive out of this city in my new company car.

[ Lilly moves two chairs and (something else) to the front of the stage to simulate the front seats of a car. He sits in the driver’s seat of an incredibly small car. He pats the passenger seat. ]

DAN:
Sit in my car, James.

JAMES:
In this tiny car, Dan?

DAN:
Sit in the flibbin’ car, James.

JAMES:
Yes sir.

[ James sits on the passenger side. Dan begins driving. ]

DAN:
Where are we going, James?

JAMES:
It doesn’t matter.

JAMES:
We don’t need a map. We don’t need a GPS.

JAMES AND DAN:
Our hearts will be our guide.

JAMES:
Dan?

DAN:
JAMES.

JAMES:
Dan, I’m having second thoughts, man.

DAN:
It’s too late for second thoughts James! We are in the shit! There is no going back.

[ Dan howls. ]

JAMES:
I have a wife and kids back home, Dan.

DAN [ shocked. ]
That wasn’t on your resume, James.

JAMES:
I didn’t think--

DAN:
You fucking lied to me, James.

[ Dan floors the accelerator. Lilly stands next to the car dressed as a police officer. She watches the car drive past and hops in her “car” to give chase. ]

JAMES:
Dan you’re going way too fast!

DAN:
You lied to me James. How long before you left me, huh?

JAMES:
Dan this all happened so fast.

DAN:
It wasn’t going to be twelve fucking years was it?

JAMES:
You’re scaring me, Dan. You need to slow down.

[ Dan begins driving erratically. ]

You’re going to kill us.

DAN:
I’m already dead, James. I died the moment we met.

JAMES:
What?!

DAN:
Fuck you, James.

[ We hear the sound of police sirens. ]

JAMES:
Thank god, the cops. Pull over.

DAN:
Shit, man. I’ve got a kilo of coke in the trunk, man.

JAMES:
Ah shit, man.

DAN:
Yeah, man.

JAMES:
Ah shit, man.

DAN:
Yeah, man. They ain’t takin’ me alive, man.

[ Reaches to his hip and draws a hand shaped as a gun. ]

JAMES:
Oh fuck, Dan.

DAN:
You with me, Jimmy?

JAMES:
I-I-I-I-I just--

DAN:
You gotta make up your mind here and now, man.

[ James regains his composure. ]

JAMES:
I’m with you, Dan.

DAN:
There’s a pantomime gun under the seat.

[ James reaches under the seat and pulls out his hand shaped like a gun. ]

Alright James! You finally grew a pair.

[ Dan swerves the car and stops. He opens the door and starts to get out. The cop is quicker and shoots Dan with her finger gun. ]

JAMES:
Oh my god! Dan! Dan!

DAN [ dying ]:
James, I never learned to ride a bike.

JAMES:
I’ll teach you how.

DAN:
What will people say, James? Two grown men, one who can’t ride a bike because he never learned, and one teaching him while wearing jean shorts and baby oil.

JAMES:
I don’t care what they say.

DAN:
JAMES - I’m dead.

[ James slowly puts his finger gun in his mouth and shoots himself in the head. He dies. ]

[ BEAT. ]

[ DAN and James both hop to their feet. ]

DAN:
James.

JAMES:
Yeah, Dan.

DAN:
Welcome aboard.

JAMES:
Thank you sir.

DAN:
Lilly, please show James to his office.

LILLY:
Yes sir. I’m Lilly.

JAMES:
Hey there, Lilly. I’m James, and I think I’m going to like working here.

[ They all laugh. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

OUTLINE FOR MARATHON SHOW
 
 
 
[ DARKNESS. SPICY LATIN MUSIC PLAYS. ]
v/o
Senores y senoras! Chicas y muchachos! Es medianoche del sabado! Es el momento de SABADO FABULOSO con sus vecinos terrificos! Y ahora, por favor den la bienvenida a su anfitrión, Curtis Luciani!
[ LIGHTS UP. CURTIS ENTERS. ]
Curtis
Gracias, senores y senoras! Gracias! Mi nombre es Curtis Luciani. Tenemos un gran espectáculo para esta noche. De hecho, va a ser fabuloso! Al principio - oh no - aquí viene: Joel El Impío!
[ JOEL ENTERS IN A CAPE AND LUCHADOR MASK. He messes with the audience WHILE MUSIC PLAYS. He hits a pose. ]
Y! Y! Y! Y! La bella, la encantadora Steph!
[ STEPH ENTERS IN A FLOWERY DRESS TO MUSIC. She does a little dance with maracas. ]
Buenas noches, Steph. Como estas?
Steph
Bien! Me gusta jugar con mis maracas!
Curtis
Como?
Steph
He dicho que me gusta jugar con mis maracas!
[ Curtis gives the crowd a leering look, shrugs. ]
Curtis
Has oído de ella.
[ Joel laughs maniacally. ]
Steph
Bien, es hora de jugar tu juego favorito: "¿Cual pescado?"
[ MUSIC PLAYS. Joel grabs two bags with a plastic fish inside each one. He dances around with them. Steph turns a flipchart to the words "CUAL PESCADO?" with two crudely drawn fish. ]
CUrtis
¿Quién quiere jugar?
[ He selects a member of the audience. Asks some questions: "Como se llama?" "Cual es su trabajo?" "Quiere jugar cual pescado?" ]
OK, vamos a jugar! Y! Y! Y! Y! Cual pescado? Cual pescado? Cual pescado?
[ Starts a chant. Joel directs the audience member to choose the "wrong" fish. LOSING HORNS PLAY. ]
Steph
Lo siento. Es el pescado muerte. Que hedor!
Curtis
Lo siento, ________, lo siento. Quien mas quiere jugar?
[ We pick someone else from the audience. They are allowed to select the "correct" fish. ]
Steph
Felicidades! Es el pescado fresco!
[ FUN MUSIC PLAYS. ]
Curtis
Pescado fresco! Pescado fresco!
[ Joel starts dancing with the fish. He gives the audience member a box of goldfish. ]
Y ahora, vamos a cha-cha!
[ We start a dance line with the music up. SLOWLY, LIGHTS AND MUSIC FADE.
LIGHTS UP on Joel, Steph, and Curtis arranging chairs. ]
Steph
Yeah, it's on every Saturday. It's the craziest thing you've ever seen.
Curtis
Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about. It's the show with all those crazy characters, and that old guy hosts the thing.
Steph
Right, and they do some game show stuff, but there are also guests, and women in bikinis, and sometimes they have people come up and do, like, karaoke.
Curtis
No rules.
Steph
No rules.
JOEL
What are you guys talking about?
Curtis
What?
JOEL
What are you talking about?
Steph
What?
Joel
What. Are. You. Talking. About.
[ Curtis and Steph stare at each other quizzically. ]
What are you talking about! What are you talking about! What are you talking about!
Curtis
He wants to know ...
Steph
... what we're talking about?
Joel
Yes! Yes!
Steph
Not now, Joel, we've got guests coming over!
[ We talk about how excited we are to have some guests over for some fun parlor games. We talk about all the different games we could play: "Rummikub! Apples to Apples! Taboo! Biathlon! Decathlon! Russian Roulette! Cagefighting! Cockfighting! Sophie's Choice!"
Then, we'll start to bring the marathon improvisers up on stage with us, welcoming them and chatting with them. We offer them snacks: Swedish Fish tacos and cups of Monster Energy Drink.
Then, it's time for our first parlor game!
We flip the flipchart to the first parlor game: "Botticelli"! ]
Curtis
OK, this one is fun. OK, so, let's say it's your turn. So, you would say "I'm a famous B." As in my name starts with "B". Get it? So then I would say, "Is your most famous painting The Birth of Venus?" And then you would say, "Yes, I'm Botticelli." This is a game to test whether or not you can successfully think of Botticelli when asked. So here we go. Are you thinking of Botticelli? Are you thinking of Botticell?
[ Go down the line. If everyone is thinking of Botticelli, then success! ]
Curtis
Great. That was kind of a warm up. It tests your ability to think of Botticelli when you are instructed to.
Joel
Let's move on to the next game. This one is called "What were we thinking?"
[ Joel explains the game. "What were we thinking?" consists of YTN presenting the weirdest, most elliptical ideas from the Idea Repository. The marathon improvisers will then do scenes that seek to answer the question, "what were we thinking?"
1. A man calls a for a prostitute and a stereotypical Italian chef shows up, other stereotypes follow
2. Gynecologist system is not Y2K compliant, but that means they can diagnose your vagina in the future ... although they cannot share the results because of the prime directive
3. office settles all disputes with tickle fights
4. The dog shit police state -- DNA testing
5. A super-group of shitty aspiring garage bands get together to sing a benefit song for their friend who desperately needs a haircut.
[ Other games:
"Time Capsule: Letters to Historical Figures"

The letters:

"Dear Child Abraham Lincoln. How's that Log Cabin of yours? Hahahaha. I once heard that you walked eight miles to return a book. That doesn't make any 'cents'! Get it? You will! No, but seriously, I think it's really cool that you will grow up to be our greatest president and to free all the slaves. Sometimes you'll have a beard and sometimes you won't have a beard.   P.S. Don't ever go to see any plays, ever. Because plays are for gays. Get it? You will!"

"Dear St. Augustine: How's it hangin', man? It's been a rough week for me ... ... I tell you what."

"Dear Joel's Mom: I bring you a warning from the future. One day, you will be tempted to heed the demands of your body and, using your fertile womb, bring offspring into the world. You must not do it. The manchild you will bear will disappoint you terribly ... and he will also invent nanobots that will consume all of the earth's flora and fauna. For this reason, you must not bear this child, at all costs. I know you only as Joel's mom, and this letter is so addressed. If you have considered someday naming a son Joel, then this letter is for you. Love, Joel's friend ... an intelligent nanobot."

"Hush Puppy Races"
"Zydeco Dance Lessons with The Zydeco Brothers"
"Short Scenes to a Soundtrack where the Soundtrack is the Bass Synth Line from Take My Breath Away"
"Let's Watch Five Minutes of Disney's The Lion King"]
JOEL
This may be our favorite game of all, because it involves our favorite subject: exotic birds!
STEPH
I love exotic birds.
Joel
You know what? I even like non-exotic birds.
Steph
Me too!
Joel
I pretty much like all kinds of birds and am happy to talk about them at any time.
Curtis
And that's why this next game is called  "the ornithology game"...
[ Turns flipchart to "The Ornithology Game". ]
... or "Wu'zat Bird Called?"

[ Powerpoint presentation shows titles of show. Joel shrugging, surrounded by birds, with the text around him. MUSIC PLAYS.

So here is how the game will work.

We divide the marathon improvisers into two teams.

There will be two rounds, each of which consists of one question for each team.

The question is always a picture of a bird ... a hard-to-identify exotic bird. A little Joel pops up next to the image of the bird, with the sound "WU'ZAT BIRD CALLED?"

For each question, the team may answer (which they will be very much discouraged from doing) or may dare the other team to answer by saying "Squawk squawk, let's her YOU talk!"

Then the other team may answer, or may respond in kind by saying "What are you, chicken?"

Then the other team must say "We don't know what's right; so we're taking flight." That leads to the "special challenge."

(Each one of these catchphrases should be written on the flipchart so that the audience can chant them along with us when the time comes.)

The special challenges are improv games with bird themes.

PECKING ORDER -- This is a basic status game. Four birds on a telephone wire. (But they can speak normally.) They are circularly subservient to each other, status wise. (i.e. A obeys B, B obeys C, C obeys D, D obeys A) Get an audience suggestion for the scene: "What is something that a group of birds might want, or might be trying to accomplish?"

BIRD CALLS -- The players will act out a well-known scene from movies, theater, or literature, but communicating only through birdsongs. Get audience suggestions: "What is a movie, book, or play that has several famous, well-known scenes in it?"

ONE'S A BIRD -- This is a variation on the "murder" game. There is a scene with four people. One person leaves the room. Then the audience decides which of the three remaining people is actually a bird. The fourth person is called back into the room and they perform a scene. (You can get a basic audience suggestion for this: location, occupation, single word, etc.) The scene ends when the fourth person determines which of the other three people is actually a bird.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER -- Three of the people on the team are birds flying in a V formation. They talk and move at the same time. The other person has to interact with them. (So, it's a simple variation on the "two or three people talk at the same time" scene ... a basic two-person scene except one person is played by three birds flying and talking in V formation.) You can get a basic audience suggestion for this as well: location, occupation, single word, etc.

We wish contestants "good pluck" before every challenge. After two challenges, Joel tries to "take us to a commercial," although we are not on TV.

Both teams will "win" their challenges, so the game will end in a tie of two and two.
Which leaves "The Lightning Round!"

The lightning round. Each team has twenty seconds to name as many birds as possible. (One team will leave the room while the other takes its turn.) The birds will be on a PowerPoint slideshow and will include Big Bird, Tweety, Foghorn Leghorn, fried chicken and all sorts of nonsense in addition to real birds. We need twenty seconds worth of countdown music.

The winner is declared, and we play outro music. ]
Steph
Well, that's it for tonight folks. We hope you've had some fun with our little parlor games.
Curtis
I think we've got one left, don't we?
Joel
Oh, yeah ...
[ We play our final parlor game: "ZYDECO DANCE PARTY"! Zydeco music plays. We dance! ]

  BUSINESS MEETING



  a sense of causality in the role shifts
  punishment (involuntary body punishment through a control collar)
  they are quietly/secretly working on a revolt as they go about business
  we join them in the middle of business as usual
  a hamster water dispenser for them to drink from
  "Barry's an idea guy. I'm an idea guy." "But you're not Barry. And you won't be for another six minutes, at least."

  generic business lingo
  captain handsome face = Carl
  nodding = Barry
  overwhelmed with files and phone calls = Debbie
  specific rules to experiment = shocked if discuss the experiment
  ending = phone call that says shock collars disabled, door is unlocked

  [ LIGHTS UP.

  Barry (Courtney) is seated scribbling on a note pad. There is a plate of cheese cubes. Carl (Joel) is looking out a window in search of inspiration. Debbie (Curtis) is holding a cell phone and a file. They are all wearing control collars around their necks.

  BELL.

  They each grab a cheese cube and switch roles -- Curtis becomes Carl, Courtney becomes Debbie, Joel becomes Barry . ]

  DEBBIE (COURTNEY)
  You told me Thursday. No, no no. You said you would have the order shipped by Thursday.

  [ She hands the file to Barry. ] 

  You said you had it "under control."

  [ She makes finger quotes. ]

  Well I just used finger quotes. Yes, finger quotes.

  [ Debbie EXITS. ]

  BARRY:
  So.

  CARL:
  So.

  BARRY:
  We are two business men.

  CARL:
  Yes. We are.

  BARRY:
  Two business men who survived the collapse of an empire.

  CARL:
  Did we survive, Barry? At one time I had seven hundred employees. I made million dollar deals daily. I was powerful.

  BARRY:
  You still have power, Carl. Your name still means something. 

  CARL:
  My name is meaningless now. At one point I could destroy a man with the push of a button. Not harm him physically but destroy everything in his life that brought him joy. Now, I have a staff of two.

  [ Debbie ENTERS with another file. She is talking on the phone with the same person. ]

  DEBBIE:
  What do you mean people don't use finger quotes anymore? 

  [ She hands the file to Barry. ]

  I saw someone use them the other day. At the store.

  [ BELL. No one moves.

  BELL.

  The three are electrocuted through their collars. They writhe in pain. The electrocution ends and they give dirty looks to scientists off stage.

  The three each eat a cheese cube. The three characters rotate. Courtney is Carl, Curtis is Barry, and Joel is Debbie. ]

  BARRY:
  So.
   
  CARL: 
  So, we start from scratch.

  BARRY:
  We've done it before, Carl.

  CARL:
  We'll have to start small. We need to go back to the basics.

  BARRY:
  We just need our start. An idea. A product. Something.

  CARL:
  I've got it! My son had a lemonade stand.

  BARRY [ confused ]:
  Okay.

  CARL:
  When he was twelve he made lemonade. A pitcher of lemonade.

  BARRY:
  I'm gonna write this down.

  CARL:
  Good idea.

  BARRY [ saying what he is writing ]:
  Son made lemonade by the pitcher.

  CARL:
  So he made a pitcher of lemonade and sold the lemonade by the glass.

  BARRY:
  This is good.

  CARL:
  He charged fifty cents a glass.

  BARRY:
  Great. Great.

  CARL:
  Then he would come home empty handed because he was a failure.

  BARRY [stops writing]:
  Okay.

  CARL:
  So I hit him.

  [ Barry starts writing. ]

  Don't write that last part.

  [ Debbie ENTERS carrying a file. She is still having the same conversation. ]

  DEBBIE:
  Fine. Fine. Don't use finger quotes.

  [ Debbie hands the file to Barry. ]

  Just because people, myself included, still use them doesn't mean you have to. My weight has nothing to do with it!

  [ Debbie puts her phone away. Barry opens a file and shredded newspaper falls on his lap. ]

  BARRY:
  Debbie, what do you know about lemonade stands?

  DEBBIE:
  Do you want to start a lemonade stand?

  CARL:
  Yes. Yes we do. Right now. Do you have any experience?

  DEBBIE:
  Well, I had one for a few summers when I was a little girl.

  [ Carl and Barry share a look. ]

  BARRY:
  I've never seen one, however, it seems that we have now been excited by the idea of lemonade stands.

  CARL:  
  So we will, of course, over the next few days be obsessed with lemonade stands and everything related to lemonade stands.

  DEBBIE:
  Very good, sir.

  CARL:
  You do have the most experience here. Where do you suggest we start?


  DEBBIE:
  Okay. I have an idea.

  [ BELL.

  The three each eat a cheese cube. The three characters rotate. Joel is Carl, Courtney is Barry, and Curtis is Debbie. ]

  CARL:
  This better be good, Debbie.

  DEBBIE:
  I'm on it, sir.

  [ Debbie EXITS. ]

  CARL:
  This has to be good, Barry. 

  BARRY:
  It will be, Carl. It will be.

  CARL:
  It's too late to dream of being back on the top, but halfway up wouldn't be so bad.

  BARRY:
  No sir. I think we have a good shot with this one.

  [ Debbie ENTERS on the phone. ]

  DEBBIE:
  It needs to say "Lemonade for sale." 'For' should be the number four. And print some letters backwards.

  [ Barry hands the files to Debbie. Debbie turns to exit. ]

  BARRY:
  Now, we need to think of locations.

  [ BELL TWICE.

  Carl, Debbie, and Barry share confused looks. They slowly move towards the table and each take two cheese cubes. ] 

  CARL:
  So, I guess I'm Barry again.

  DEBBIE:
  No, you'll be Debbie.

  BARRY:
  Why does he get to be Debbie. I want to be Debbie

  DEBBIE:
  The bell rang twice. I assume we rotate twice.  

  CARL:
  Besides, you make a lousy Debbie.

  BARRY:
  You think you're a better Debbie?

  CARL:
  I feel like a Debbie.

  BARRY:
  You're not even a woman!

  CARL:
  Neither are you!

  BARRY:
  Yes I am!

  DEBBIE:
  Really?

  [ A voice sounds from the booth or over the PA. ]

  VOICE:
  Hey guys. Um...We just got word that the university has cut our funding. The experiment is over. It appears that we never actually told anyone what we would be doing and why the data would be useful. It's actually kind of surprising they let us use their facilities for the last five years. Anyway, we're done here. So, if you would leave the testing floor, retrieve you're belongings, and exit the facility in a timely fashion they won't call security.  

  DEBBIE:
  You know. I think I really learned something during all of this.

  CARL:
  I think we all did.

  BARRY:
  I learned you're a dick.

  DEBBIE:
  Debbie would never say that.

  [ They EXIT discussing characteristics of the roles.

  LIGHT DOWN. ]

  COURTNEY
  Welcome to the Business-Corp meet and greet. You must have quite a few thoughts running through your heads with Business-Corp planning to begin construction of one of it’s mega-massive ultra-stores in your town in the next few months.

  JOEL
  We’re here to answer all of your questions and address any concerns you might have. Now there’s quite a few of you here tonight, so please shout out all at once.

  [ They both laugh at this stupid joke. ]

  COURTNEY
  That’s funny, Joel.

  JOEL
  Thanks, Courtney.

  [ Sound effect: shock/electrocution sounds. Courtney and Joel writhe around appropriately. ]

  COURTNEY
  Sorry. That was my fault.


  JOEL
  No big deal. Really.

  [ Sound effect: shock/electrocution sounds. They are electrocuted again. ]

  COURTNEY
  Business-Corp!

  JOEL
  Yes, Business-Corp. Let’s talk about Business-Corp.

  COURTNEY
  They make all sorts of products.

  JOEL
  I like products.

  COURTNEY
  And who makes the best products?

  JOEL
  Why the Chinese, of course.

  CURTIS
  Oh hey, howsit going?

  BRADEN
  You going to social studies?

  COURTNEY
  I’ve got language arts next.

  CURTIS
  Cool, I’ll see you in P.E.

  [ They all suddenly relax ]

  COURTNEY
  Whew!

  CURTIS
  That was close.

  BRADEN
  Do you think she knew?

  CURTIS and COURTNEY
  No way!

  BRADEN
  Do you remember guys? Remember when this all started?

  CURTIS
  When my Math book became my best friend?

  COURTNEY
  When a simple crowded hallway could become a full on nightmare of accidental touches and inappropriate, uncontrollable responses?

  BRADEN
  Yeah.

  CURTIS
  Yeah.

  COURTNEY
  Yeah.

  CURTIS V.O.
  I was in the 6th grade, they year, 1997. Clinton was re-inaugurated as president of the United States of America and Britain handed sovereignty of Hong Kong over to the Chinese. Taylor Kennedy was as beautiful as all of the Spice Girls rolled into one and as badass as Buffy Summers. Watching her glide through the halls in those chunky platform sandals created in me a feeling I’d never felt before, something not under my control. Something boys and men get because they feel good. Sometimes boys and men get this feeling and they like it, or sometimes they get it and they want it to go away so they try to go pee and that will make it go away. But I didn’t want to go pee. I didn’t want the feeling I got from Taylor Kennedy to go away.
  COURTNEY
  “Boys and men”? Do you mean Boyz II Men?
  CURTIS
  No! Do you get one when you listen to Boyz II Men?
  COURTNEY
  No!
  BRADEN [ simultaneously ]
  Sometimes!
  [ They look at Braden. ]
  BRADEN
  What? They have great harmonies! It’s like a cool barbershop quartet for our generation! But cooler!
  COURTNEY
  Man, that’s weird.
  CURTIS
  It’s ALL weird. Everything that’s happening to us is weird!
  COURTNEY
  It’s weird, but it’s not weird like that.
  CURTIS
  Is that not how you remember it happening?
  COURTNEY
  Not at all. I remember a heady, political time...

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OrQYrXDcLs

  COURTNEY V.O.
  I was in the 7th grade, the year was 1968. It was a leap year and Laugh In had just debuted and so had I. Her name was Deborah Whitman. Her hair was black as Spiro Agnew’s heart, and soft as AM gold, parted down the middle and flowing freely all the way down her back. Her eyes were a deep rich brown like chocolate warmed in a fondue pot, a cool new piece of food technology that allowed family style servings of melted food. She was the first person ever to give me that special feeling, like I wanted to put a daisy in her rifle barrel. She loved the first LP on the White Album but not the second. She liked ‘I Dream of Jeannie’ but not ‘Bewitched’. She could tie a cherry stem in her mouth with her tongue. She was like a specific kind of sports car for the time period, sleek and smooth with lines and a motor. Deborah caused in me a freewheeling feeling and my brain told my penis to just “chill out dude, stop being so uptight and let the blood flow freely”. It’s okay, I’m okay, you’re okay, it’s time for a REVOLUTION. That girl inspired the Kinsey Reports in my loins.

  BRADEN
  That’s a very liberal interpretation, don’t you think?

  COURTNEY
  That’s how I remember it, man. It was a different time.

  CURTIS
  I guess I’ll understand when I’m older. You guys ever get one for an aunt?

  BRADEN
  Gross!

  CURTIS
  It’s not my fault! She was watching “Wild Kingdom” on TV and the elephants were doing it and she was smoking a cigarette and looking like she didn’t even CARE!

  BRADEN
  That’s so gross! I’m retrospectively upset you gave me shit about Boyz II Men.

  COURTNEY
  Both of you need to mellow out, man. You can’t control it. It’s like a little invader in your body and soul. No one is safe: not elephants, not your aunt, not Shawn Stockman, Wanya Morris, Nathan Morris--

  BRADEN
  Who?

  COURTNEY
  These are the members of Boyz II Men. Are you a real fan or not?

  BRADEN
  Look, I’m not down with this stuff. You have to remember, I’m a year older. And when it first happened to me, it wasn’t like that at all.

  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgdTOJYZ_vE

  BRADEN V.O.
  It was 8th grade, the year, 1929. It started on a Tuesday and ended the decade long acid trip that was the “Roaring Twenties”. Everyone remembers it as the year the stock market crashed but I remember it as the year my body matured to enable sexual reproduction and fertilization. Her name was Shelby O’Neill. Her hair was a delicious bonnet of shining curls clinging all around her forehead. Eyebrows as thin as whispers and eyes like shining orbs floating in space. For the first time ever, the nitrous oxide levels in my trabecular arteries and the smooth muscles of my penis rose causing a feeling I couldn’t quite hide. Oh, how my arteries would dilate at the sight of Shelby in the hallway of our high school, stunning in a dropped waist dress and cloche hat, smoking a cigarette in a opera length cigarette holder. Blood rushed into my corpora cavernosa, the twin sponge-like regions which contain most of the blood during arousal, upon the sight of her. In other words *TRAIN WHISTLE*.

  BRADEN
  That’s right. That bearcat had bubs for miles! Made me fancy turning to a real cake-eater.

  COURTNEY
  Whatever.

  CURTIS
  What are you even talking about?

  BRADEN
  That’s how it was, guys.

  CURTIS
  Well, that’s how it was, but now it’s 1986.

  BRADEN
  Reaganomics!

  COURTNEY
  The Cola wars!

  BRADEN
  Platoon!

  COURTNEY
  That cool red car!

  CURTIS
  And look out, here comes Jennifer!

  BRADEN and COURTNEY
  Whoooooooooa!

  [ “Dancing on The Ceiling”, everyone goes nuts. ]

  CURTIS V.O.
  Well, no matter when it happens, it’s a special time for a young man or boy.

  COURTNEY V.O.
  The time when biology and society came together to make us stop seeing women as fellow human beings and start seeing them as terrifying objects of desire, jealousy, and fear.

  BRADEN V.O.
  The sacred time when our deep shame at our own bodies is converted, by beer commercials and “gentleman’s interest” magazines, into a sense that we are entitled to be surrounded by big boobs all the time!

  COURTNEY V.O.
  Sometimes I forget that women aren’t just floating ribcages. And god, I get out of the shower and I need another shower.

  CURTIS V.O.
  Boners, man.

  BRADEN V.O.
  Boners!

  COURTNEY V.O.
  Boners. This is what it feels like to be a young man or boy.

  CURTIS V.O.
  And what does a young woman’s burgeoning sexuality feel like?

  COURTNEY V.O.
  There’s literally no possible way for anyone to ever know, because it’s not physically manifested in any way.

  1. 6th grade, late 90s basic kid like description of erection

  2. 7th grade late 60s, sexual revolutiony or very porny description of erection

  3. 8th grade, late 20s, very textual detailed description of erection

  An erection (clinically: penile erection or penile tumescence; informal/slang: stiffy, hard-on, boner and many others) is a physiological phenomenon of the male genitalia of many species, in which the penis becomes firmer, engorged and enlarged. Penile erection is the result of a complex interaction of psychological, neural, vascular and endocrine factors, and is usually, though not exclusively, associated with sexual arousal or sexual attraction. The shape, angle and direction of an erection varies considerably in humans.
  Physiologically, erection is triggered by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), causing nitrous oxide (a vasodilator) levels to rise in the trabecular arteries and smooth muscle of the penis. The arteries dilate causing the corpora cavernosa of the penis (and to a lesser extent thecorpora spongiosum) to fill with blood; simultaneously the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa restricting the egress and circulation of this blood. Erection subsides when parasympathetic activity reduces to baseline.
  As an autonomic response, erection may result from a variety of stimuli, including sexual stimulation and sexual arousal, and is therefore not entirely under conscious control. Erection during sleep or upon waking up are known as nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT). Absence of nocturnal erection is commonly used to distinguish between physical and psychological causes of erectile dysfunction and impotence.
  A penis which is partly, but not fully, erect is sometimes known as a semi-erection (clinically: partial tumescence); a penis which is not erect is typically referred to as being flaccid, or soft.
  An erection begins in the brain. Physical and/or mental stimulation cause nerves in the brain to send chemical messages to nerves in the penis telling the penile blood vessels to relax so that blood can flow freely into the penis. Once in the penis, high pressure traps the blood within both corpora cavernosa. This causes the penis to expand and sustain an erection.
  Erection is reversed when the inflow of blood is stopped and opening outflow channels open, allowing the penis to become soft.
  In the presence of mechanical stimulation, erection is initiated by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with minimal input from the central nervous system. Parasympathetic branches extend from the sacral plexus into the arteries supplying the erectile tissue; upon stimulation, these nerve branches release acetylcholine, which, in turn causes release of nitric oxide from endothelial cells in the trabecular arteries.[1] Nitric oxide diffuses to the smooth muscle of the arteries (called trabecular smooth muscle[2]), acting as a vasodilating agent. The arteries dilate, filling the corpora spongiosum and cavernosa with blood. The ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles also compress the veins of the corpora cavernosa, limiting the venous drainage of blood.[3] Erection subsides when parasympathetic stimulation is discontinued; baseline stimulation from the sympathetic division of the ANS causes constriction of the penile arteries, forcing blood out of the erectile tissue.[4]

Each angel has a unique hand-painted face.

MAN:
And what are the noses made of?

They’re just little balls.

Yes.

Yeah!

MAN:
Sheila, you remember Chuck? From the phone calls.

WOMAN:
OK.

CALLER:
I got another question.

WOMAN:
Great.

CALLER:
If you happened upon a Surge can would you use it for one of your angels?

WOMAN:
Yes, I suppose I would.

CALLER:
What if I told you I had a Surge can? Would you use that specific one?

WOMAN:
Sure.

CALLER:
If I had a Surge can and gave it to you would you use it?

WOMAN:
Yes I would. I think that would be kind of fun.

MAN:
That would be fun. Chuck, give her that Surge can.

WOMAN:
I can make you a special Chuck angel.

MAN:
Do you have a Surge can, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

[ SOUND: CROWD GOES NUTS. ]

Do you have it with you?

Yes.

Oh yes.

MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it’s time to …

[ SOUND: CROWD BEGINS TO CHANT, “SHOW IT TO ME!” ]

[ Sheila lifts the box, revealing the angel. ]

[ SOUND GOES SILENT. Two guys onstage look a little disappointed. ]

CALLER:
This isn’t really my kind of thing. When you guys were telling me bout it I got really excited. I had so many questions I couldn’t think straight. Now that I see it, no thank you.

[ He hands the angel back to WOMAN and walks away. ]

CALLER:
See you guys later.

[ The two dudes quietly excuse themselves and go. Long pause. ]

MAN:
Well, that was a complete embarrassment. Guess we’re never doing this show again.

WOMAN:
I’m sorry.

[ Man buries his head in his hands. ]

MAN:
Jesus, do you have any idea how much it cost to rent this stadium? Jesus, Glon, what were you thinking?

WOMAN:
I had a nice time talking about my angels with you.

MAN:
Get out. Just go, please.

WOMAN:
I mean, what did you think it was going to--

MAN:
Not that! I don’t know, but not that!

THE COMMENTARY

[STUPID WAITER BRINGS TOO MUCH ends. The neighbors congratulate each other on a good scene. ]

COURTNEY
Whew. That was a good scene. Now folks, this next part is really exciting. Using state of the art technology, we’re going to to watch what we just taped...

[ CURTIS takes a tape out of his pocket. ]

COURTNEY
 …and give you instant commentary!

[CURTIS puts the tape back in his pocket. JOEL, CURTIS and COURTNEY sit down and the scene begins. ]

ALL
(Improvised commentary stuff)

[ While all this is happening, on screen MANAGER has started butchering on-screen WAITER and then CUSTOMER to death. He’s hacking them to pieces with an axe or something. Suddenly real-life JOEL and COURTNEY notice. ]

COURTNEY
Oh my god, Curtis, what are you doing?

CURTIS
What? Nothing.

JOEL
Oh, oh, oh no oh the humanity.

COURTNEY
Curtis! Curtis! You’re killing us! Stop it! Joel! We have to do something!

JOEL
Call 9111!

COURTNEY
Call 91111!

[JOEL takes out his phone and dials and waits ]

JOEL
Where da party at? Where dem bitches at, nomsayin?

[JOEL hangs the phone up and puts it away.]

COURTNEY
What’d they say?

JOEL
Nuthin’.

COURTNEY
We’re gonna have to do a citizen’s arrest.

COURTNEY and JOEL
Citizen’s arrest! Citizen’s arrest!

[JOEL and COURTNEY arrest CURTIS. They take him off stage and come back onstage without him. ]

COURTNEY [to audience ]
Ladies and gentlemen. Let me welcome you to Your Terrific Neighbors court of the people where justice is a fickle tart who eats all your pudding and leaves you with a serious case of the willies.

JOEL [to audience ]
Please fan yourselves with your programs during this portion of the show because we want it to look like we’re in a real Southern courtroom.

[to Courtney ]

Okay, I wanna be judge.

COURTNEY
I wanna be judge. I’m the judgiest.

JOEL
You certainly are judgemental.

[They both take the rock, paper, scissors stance. Joel lands on rock and Courtney does “the rooster”. ]

COURTNEY
I win.

JOEL
What was that?

COURTNEY
Rooster. I win. Cock beats rock.

JOEL
How do you figure?

COURTNEY
Cock pecks rock. Sock beats cock because sock covers cock. Rock beats sock because rock tears a hole in the sock. Those are the rules of Cock, Rock, Sock.

JOEL
Oh yeah. Okay. I’m defense attorney. You’re prosecution. Oh! And I’m the typy lady!

COURTNEY
Stenographer? Okay.

JOEL
Gesundheit.

[COURTNEY and JOEL set up the “court”: JUDGE has a podium and there’s a cardboard box that says “jury box” and there’s a table for DEFENSE with two chairs, there’s a table for PROSECUTION with two chairs and there’s a chair for STENOGRAPHER. JOEL rushes out as the BAILIFF and brings CURTIS back in, who is wearing rudimentary shackles. JOEL runs over to be the PLAINTIFF, fanning himself with a fancy fan. COURTNEY and JOEL become JURY and whisper to each other. JOEL becomes DEFENSE and consoles CURTIS. COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION. JOEL then runs back to be the BAILIFF. COURTNEY runs offstage to be JUDGE. ]

JOEL [ as bailiff ]
All rise for the honorable Madam Judge.

[the JURY rises. The DEFENSE rises, the STENOGRAPHER rises, the PROSECUTION rises. COURTNEY ends as JUDGE, JOEL ends as PLAINTIFF. ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
You may be seated. In the case of Courtney and Joel v. Curtis. Curtis, you are charged with the brutal slaying of Courtney and Joel. How do you plead?

CURTIS
Not guilty!

COURTNEY [as judge ]
You’ve been charged with a very serious crime, son. Do you understand the charges brought against you?

CURTIS
Yes your honor. No your honor. Not really your honor!

COURTNEY [as judge ]
Are you getting this, Judy?

[JOEL runs to STENOGRAPHER chair ]

JOEL [as stenographer ]
Yes your honor, yes, every word!

[ JOEL becomes DEFENSE. COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION ]

CURTIS
I mean, they’re sitting right there! I can’t have murdered them.

COURTNEY [ as prosecution ]
Mr. Suspenders, can you control your client?

JOEL [ as defense ]
My client is perfectly controlled Mrs. Pants.

COURTNEY [ as prosecution ]
Objection, your honor.

[COURTNEY becomes JUDGE ]

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
On what grounds?

[COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION ]

COURTNEY [ as prosecution ]
The name is Pantsuit and I am NOT married.

JOEL
My apologies Ms. Pantsuit.

COURTNEY [ as prosecution ]
Quite alright.

[ COURTNEY becomes JUDGE ]

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
Mr. Suspenders, your opening statement please.

[COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION ]

JOEL [ as defense ]
Thank you your honor, ladies and gentleman of the jury, Ms. Pantsuit. I was not made aware there would be statements made. I did not prepare for this. Thank you.

[JOEL runs over to be PLAINTIFF ]

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
You’re welcome. Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, the course of my clients lives have been altered forever. Seeing themselves murdered has deeply scarred them emotionally, not to mention the fact that they’ve been murdered!

JOEL [as plaintiff ]
Yeah! You deserve to die and I hope you burn in hell, you sick fucker! You make me sick. That’s right, fucker, you sicken me!

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
Your honor, I move to have that outburst stricken from the record.

[COURTNEY runs over to be JUDGE. JOEL becomes DEFENSE. ]

JOEL [ as defense ]
I second that, your honor.

[ JOEL becomes STENOGRAPHER ]

COURTNEY [as Judge ]
Motion carries.

JOEL [as stenographer while crossing out words with a pen ]
The language, the language, disgusting.

[JOEL becomes DEFENSE ]

JOEL [as defense ]
I call one Curtis Luciani to the stand.

[ Curtis walks to the left of the JUDGE and stands there ]

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
Son, I am going to have to ask you to enter the witness stand properly.

CURTIS
uh....

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
Please use the door on the side.

CURTIS
There’s nothing there.

COURTNEY [as judge ]
Please enter the witness stand properly or I will have no choice but to hold you in contempt of court.

CURTIS
Good. Do it. I’m sick of this.

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
You called my bluff. I do not know what contempt of court means. Please do not make me look it up. Just enter the witness stand properly.

[ Curtis walks around to the “door” and opens it and goes back to standing where he was. ]

JOEL [as defending attorney ]
Where were you at the time of these so-called murders, Mr. Luciani?

[ JOEL becomes PLAINTIFF, COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION, they whisper among themselves. ]

CURTIS
I, I, I don’t know. I just saw them on video. I was sitting over there and I saw a video.

[ JOEL becomes DEFENSE ]

JOEL [as defending attorney ]
Are you saying you cannot have killed these two currently living and breathing funny people because you were sitting in this very theater watching sketch comedy at the time?

CURTIS
That doesn’t even make any sense! Why are you defending me? This doesn’t make any sense.....

JOEL [ as defense, holding a treat in front of Curtis’ nose ]
Say you didn’t do it. Say you didn’t do it.

COURTNEY [ as prosecution ]
Objection your honor, my opponent is blatantly leading the witness!

[COURTNEY becomes JUDGE ]

JOEL [ as defense (to the rest of the courtroom) ]
Objection to the objection!

COURTNEY [as judge ]
Objection! Too much shouting! First objection sustained, second objection overruled, my objection is still under review. Ms. Pantsuit, your witness.

[COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION ]

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
Mr. Luciani, how long have you owned those hands?

CURTIS
My...whole life, I guess.

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
So you admit to owning the murder weapon!! I am done with this witness. I call the victim, the deceased Joel Osborne to the stand!

[COURTNEY and JOEL become JURORS ]

JURORS
OOH!

[JOEL goes to the witness stand as PLAINTIFF, making a big show of knowing how to use the witness stand. COURTNEY becomes JUDGE and nods approvingly. COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION ]

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
Mr. Osborne, how are you feeling today?

JOEL
Little sad.

COURTNEY [ as prosecuting attorney ]
And why is that, Mr. Osborne?

JOEL
Because I’ve been murdered, ma’am.

COURTNEY [ as prosecuting attorney ]
Can you identify the person that murdered you?

[JOEL points to MS. PANTSUIT ]

COURTNEY [ as prosecuting attorney ]
Not me, I’m your lawyer.

[JOEL timidly points around at various people while COURTNEY shakes her head “no” until JOEL points at CURTIS and she shakes her head yes. COURTNEY and JOEL become the JURY. The JURY gasps. COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION, JOEL becomes DEFENSE ]

I rest my case. Your witness, Mr. Suspenders.

[COURTNEY becomes JUDGE ]

JOEL [ as defense ]
Hmmmmm.......hmmmmmm....hmmmm yeah......hmmmm what did you say something?

[ JOEL becomes PLAINTIFF ]

JOEL
No, no I didn’t say anything.

[ JOEL becomes DEFENSE ]

CURTIS
Ask him how I could have murdered him when he’s sitting right there!

JOEL [ as defense ]
Yes, that.

[ JOEL becomes PLAINTIFF and points confidently at CURTIS. JOEL becomes DEFENSE. ]

JOEL [ as defense ]
I rest my case.

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
It’s time for closing statements.

[COURTNEY becomes PROSECUTION, JOEL becomes PLAINTIFF ]

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the defendant's case rests solely on the story “making sense” as if that means anything!

[JOEL becomes DEFENSE, COURTNEY becomes JUDGE ]

JOEL [as defending attorney ]
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, “making sense” makes perfect sense! Dollars and cents, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, DOLLARS AND SENSE!

[COURTNEY and JOEL become JURORS and cheer loudly. COURTNEY becomes JUDGE. JOEL becomes PLAINTIFF ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
Order! Order! ORDER!

[ Everyone is quiet. ]

Son, it seems plainly evident that you express no regret for your actions. These two comedians had a bright future ahead of them that you have terminated. Think of all the sketches we will never see because you have snuffed out their lives.

[JOEL is crying. ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
I have no choice, son, but to challenge you to Rock, Cock, Sock.

[they square off, CURTIS does rock, COURTNEY does COCK ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
I hereby sentence you to death in prison. May God have mercy on your soul. You’ll be eligible for parole in 90 days.

[COURTNEY slams the gavel. COURTNEY and JOEL run around to their various positions and react in ways appropriate to that character. JOEL becomes BAILIFF and takes CURTIS away. ]

CURTIS
No! No! NO!!!

[JOEL returns to the stage alone. ]

JOEL
I miss Curtis.

COURTNEY
Yeah, me, too.

JOEL
You be Curtis.

COURTNEY
No, you be Curtis!

[COURTNEY and JOEL get into rock, paper, scissors pose. COURTNEY does rock and JOEL does cock ]

JOEL
Cock beats rock! I win! You have to be Curtis!

COURTNEY
Aww, man!

JOEL
Now you get to clean up because Curtis always cleans up.

COURTNEY
Damn!

[COURTNEY begins to clean up the stage. Joel eats a jelly doughnut so the jelly and the powder gets everywhere ]

JOEL [mouth full of doughnut ]
What’s the sign for sock?

COURTNEY
Hmmm?

JOEL
It’s rock, cock, sock, right? What’s the hand sign for sock?

COURTNEY
Hmmmmm....I don’t know. I’ve only ever seen anyone do rock and cock. I guess that’s all you need.

JOEL
I thought all you need is love.

COURTNEY
No, love means never having to say you’re sorry.

JOEL
I never have to say I’m sorry. I’m Joel

COURTNEY
DOM JOEL. DOM JOEL.

[During this CURTIS comes out with an apron on and a mop. He mops the stage and scratches his ass as the lights slowly go down on the scene. ]

[LIGHTS DOWN ]

THE READING



[ LIGHTS UP. Courtney is standing. Joel and Curtis are sitting at a table, holding copies of a script. ]

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
You know, people ask us a lot of questions about our creative process.

JOEL
No, they don't.

COURTNEY [ to Joel ]
Joel, that's the premise.

CURTIS [ to audience ]
Developing a premise, by the way, is an important part of our creative process. In case you’re curious about our creative process.

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
Which, for the sake of this sketch, we are imagining that you are.

JOEL
I don't like this sketch.

CURTIS
You liked it during our reading, Joel.

JOEL
I was a different person then.

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
The reading, which Curtis has just mentioned, is another part of our creative process. It allows us to check the overall comic effectiveness, or "goodness", of a sketch. We'd like to give you a demonstration of what that's like.

[ Courtney sits with Curtis and Joel and picks up a copy of the script. ]

JOEL
Now?

COURTNEY
Yes.

[ Joel takes a deep breath. ]

JOEL
Hey guys, I wrote a new sketch. I think it's pretty good. Would you like to read it together?

CURTIS
Sure.

COURTNEY
Of course, Joel. After all, reading together is an important part of our creative process.

JOEL
OK. Courtney, you read for the bank teller.

COURTNEY
Sounds good.

JOEL
Curtis, you read for the organ grinder.

CURTIS
Does he have an accent?

JOEL
Just try to feel it out.

COURTNEY
Does the bank teller have an accent?

JOEL
Yes, but I want you to feel it out.

COURTNEY
OK. Give me a hint, though?

JOEL
Not Puerto Rican.

COURTNEY
OK.

JOEL
I'll read the stage directions.

[ They all look to their scripts. ]

JOEL
Act one, scene one.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Question?

COURTNEY
I just want to say, right now, this feels more like a full-length play than a sketch.

JOEL
OK, could we hold notes until the end?

COURTNEY
I didn't want to forget.

CURTIS
Just take the note, Joel.

JOEL
YOU TAKE THE NOTE! I'm sorry. I lost my temper. It won’t happen again. Can we start over?

CURTIS
Sure.

COURTNEY
It's just, when you start talking multiple acts and multiple scenes, it feels more like a play than a sketch.

JOEL
YOU FEEL MORE LIKE A PLAY THAN A SKETCH! I'm sorry. I promise that that won't happen again. I'll take the note. Let's start over, please.

[ beat ]

JOEL
Act one, scene one.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Already got that one.

[ Courtney lowers her hand. ]

JOEL
OK, act one, scene one. Lights up. A female bank teller, standing behind the counter of a bank. Her name tag says "Amber". Her hair is up in two curiously youthful pigtails. She is wearing a pale yellow sweater and a tan skirt, just past knee-length. Underneath, invisible to the audience for the entire duration of the sketch, is a red brassiere and mismatched blue-and-yellow stripe panties from Target.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Could we please hold notes till the end?

COURTNEY
I don't see how the underwear is relevant if the audience won't see it.

JOEL
I'm painting a word picture.

CURTIS
I get it. I think it's funny. I mean, here she is, ostensibly, like, a bank teller in a yellow sweater, but then, red bra. Right? It's funny, because, like, red bra?

COURTNEY
Look, I don't object to wearing a red bra. I own a red bra, so in that respect it's convenient for me.

JOEL
Is it the panties that trouble you?

COURTNEY
I just want to revisit this section later.

CURTIS
I'll make a note.

[ Curtis makes a note in pen on the script. ]

CURTIS
I'm circling that section, and I'm writing a "2V", as in visit twice or re-visit.

COURTNEY
OK, I'll start recording a key for our notes so we can remember what they mean.

[ She makes a note in pen on her script. ]

COURTNEY
"2V" equals re-visit.

JOEL
Should we start from the beginning or just pick it up where we were?

CURTIS
Let's keep going. I think we've got really good momentum.

JOEL [ reading ]
The teller is finishing off a half-eaten tofu pad thai in a styrofoam to-go container and daydreaming about the summers that she used to spend at her grandfather's lake house. She knows that it is against bank policy to eat at the counter, but it is a slow part of the afternoon and her manager is out running a personal errand. Every once in a while, she scratches a persistent itch on her upper right arm. She is a woman of substantial regrets. Though she is currently in a solid long-term relationship, it has been some time since she has experienced real sexual fulfillment.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

COURTNEY
Is grandfather's lakehouse a locus for her sexual regrets?

JOEL
Could be.

CURTIS
Maybe they're not directly related, but they've become linked in her mind somehow.

COURTNEY
Sure, that would be funny.

JOEL
That would be really funny.

CURTIS
I'll write it down.

[ He makes a note. ]

CURTIS
I’m circling the words “grandfather’s house,” and next to it I’m drawing a graphic image of two people having intercourse, and next to that I’m drawing a sad face.

COURTNEY
I’ll add that to the key.

[ She begins doodling, looking over to Curtis’s note. ]

COURTNEY
“Locus of sexual regret.” Got it.

JOEL
What do you guys think of the sketch so far?

COURTNEY
So far, I definitely think it's funny, but I'd like to see where it goes.

JOEL
I'd like to see where you go! I'm sorry. I 100% guarantee that that won't happen again. There was absolutely nothing in your statement to make me mad.

CURTIS
Let's continue.

JOEL [ reading ]
The bank teller sighs.

COURTNEY [ sighs, reading in a Puerto Rican accent ]
This pad thai is no good.

[ Joel raises his hand. ]

COURTNEY
I’m trying to feel this out.

JOEL
I definitely don’t want the Puerto Rican accent. Can I be honest? I had a feeling you were going to do it, and that’s why I said not to do it earlier.

COURTNEY
I appreciate your honesty.

CURTIS
Courtney, are there any other accents that you like to do?

COURTNEY No.

CURTIS
Well, that could be a problem.

COURTNEY
Well, how about this? I could keep the accent, but you could cut my dialogue.

CURTIS
That way, you both win.

JOEL
I don’t know. Your dialogue is pretty important to the sketch.

CURTIS
Joel, instead of defending against new ideas, we should be willing to try them and see if they work.

JOEL
OK. We’ll try it without you having any dialogue.

COURTNEY
But with me having a Puerto Rican accent.

CURTIS
You both win!

JOEL
OK

[ Reading. ]

JOEL
An organ grinder enters the bank, all suspenders and mustachios. He is a quirky fellow with a spring in his step. He carries an organ, but a thin leash dangles from his wrist with no monkey on the end. He does not look at the leash. Perhaps he does not even note the absence of his monkey. Perhaps he knows his monkey’s whereabouts. Perhaps he never even had a monkey at all.

CURTIS
I like this ambiguity.

JOEL
It’s funny, isn’t it?

COURTNEY
It is funny!

JOEL [ reading ]
The organ grinder approaches the teller, who regards him warily.

COURTNEY
And we cut the line here.

JOEL
OK, so it’s your line.

CURTIS [ reading, Puerto Rican accent ]
I’d like to make a deposit.

JOEL & COURTNEY
Good choice.

CURTIS
Thanks!

JOEL
Do it again.

CURTIS
I’d like to make a deposit.

[ Courtney and Joel look at each other, shake their heads. ]

COURTNEY
No, lose it.

CURTIS
I’m trying to feel it out.

[ Courtney shakes her head. ]

JOEL
Start over.

CURTIS [ reading ]
I’d like to make a withdrawal.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Yes, here’s my withdrawal slip.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Yes, it’s been a fine day for me.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
What do you mean?

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. Curtis laughs. ]

CURTIS
Not at all.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Oh no, he’s back at the office.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

JOEL [ reading ]
The teller reaches beneath the counter and pulls out a large bag of peanuts. She places them on the counter. The organ grinder takes them.

CURTIS [ reading ]
I guess I better get back. The boss hates it when I’m late.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

JOEL [ reading ]
A look of quiet desolation settles over the teller’s face. So it’s as simple as that, then, she seems to think. Lights down, slowly. Then, lights back up again. And then, more slowly this time, lights down again. And then, a tiny shaft of light. Then that fades slowly. Then, three sound cues, which are yet to be determined.

[ Joel starts giggling. ]

JOEL
Man, I think that the things that I write are good.

[ He starts reading again. ]

JOEL
OK, now: act one, scene two.

[ Curtis and Courtney both raise their hands. ]

JOEL
Guys, please. It should only be another couple of hours, and then we can do notes.

CURTIS
I have a question about why my accent was disallowed.

COURTNEY
I think there are five things about this scene that don’t work. One, bra stuff. Two, I don’t have lines anymore. Three, too long. Four, too stagey. Five, it sucks more than anything ever and isn’t funny.

JOEL
You suck more than anything ever and aren’t funny! I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. No I’m not!

CURTIS
Guys, this is getting heated. I want you to have a friendship hug, right now.

[ Joel and Courtney get up and hug reluctantly. ]

CURTIS
That’s better.

JOEL
OK.

COURTNEY
OK.

JOEL
I’ve cooled down a bit. I’ve really thought about what you have to say.

COURTNEY
I appreciate that.

JOEL
And I really think we ought to break up the troupe.

COURTNEY
You always say that.

JOEL
But I mean it this time. I feel like there are places I need to go, creatively, and you guys aren’t willing to follow me there.

COURTNEY
I respect your decision, Joel.

JOEL
You don’t understand. I’m quitting the troupe.

CURTIS
Joel, we both hear you. And I think we’re in agreement here: We respect your decision to quit the troupe.

JOEL
Fine, because I’m quitting.

COURTNEY
Yes, Joel.

JOEL
Fine.

[ Joel heads to the door, but then he stops and waits with his hand on the doorknob. ]

COURTNEY [ to Curtis ]
Should we stop him?

CURTIS
No. We have to let him go this time. We have to let him go.

[ They hold hands tightly, close their eyes. Joel sniffs. Joel makes a low, moaning sound. Curtis and Courtney hold each other’s hands even more tightly. Finally, after an awkward pause, Joel leaves. ]

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
And that’s how the reading works. We read the sketch together, we offer suggestions, and then Joel quits the troupe.

CURTIS
Do you think he’ll come back, Courtney?

COURTNEY
He will. He’s stuck backstage. He has nowhere to go.

JOEL [ offstage ]
I still don’t like this sketch.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

Hello? Stop.

LADY:
To all receivers. Stop. No communications from eastern or westernmost stations in two months. Stop. Almost out of sweet meats. Stop. Low on warm feelings as well. Stop. Narcissus dead. Stop. All Chinamen eaten by cougars. Stop. Burnt opium to stay warm. Stop. So lonely. Stop. Lonely. Stop.

Dying now. Stop.

[ She EXITS. ]

MAN 1:
Attention, midwest substation from westernmost outpost. Stop. Cleaning out station today in preparation for gold rush. Stop. Found your transmissions had fallen behind the desk. Stop. I will have a lot of visitors soon, bringing many Chinamen and supplies but am still available for conversation. Stop.

[ LIGHTS UP ON SAM. He is sitting at his desk looking over paperwork. ]

SAM:
... And because he finishes all his work on time, Principal Sam Thompson leads a parade in his own honor. Oh my, what a glorious procession, its majesty shadowed only by the many accomplishments of Nucksua County's brightest principal.
  
[ GEORGE, a janitor, ENTERS. He is holding a mop. ]

GEORGE:
I can clean now, Sam?

SAM:
Hello, George.

GEORGE:
I am the janitor.

SAM:
I know, George.

[ George begins mopping by bouncing the mop on the floor. ]

GEORGE:
Sam, everyday I see you. Everyday I clean. I clean the floors. I clean your desk. I clean your file cabinets.

SAM:
Well, George, you do clean my office.

GEORGE:
I'll clean your office now. Every morning you walk in to your office and your desk shines. Your floor sparkles. Everything is clean.
 
SAM:
George, tomorrow I'll walk in and see that my desk wasn't cleaned. The floor will still be dirty. The file cabinets will still be covered in dust.

GEORGE:
But every day I clean.

SAM:
Every day I am in my office and working at 6:30. That's AM, George. 6:30 AM. You tend to ooze through the front doors around noon.

GEORGE:
Every day I clean.

SAM:
You creep into my office at 3:15. You mop. You dust. You polish. But, nothing is ever clean.

[ George stares blankly. ]

And most days, like now, you seem to be lost in your own world.

[ George giggles. ]

Is something funny?

GEORGE:
You look different in my mind pictures.

SAM:
Okay. You also say weird things like that.

GEORGE:
Every day I clean. I work hard and clean the school.

SAM:
You are simply the most ineffective worker I have ever seen.

[ George makes cleaning motions towards Sam. ]

SAM:
Right. First, let's discuss your conflicts with the school's hours of operation.

GEORGE:
I wouldn't care if you were late.

SAM:
Unfortunately, that doesn't matter. We need to discuss your constant tardiness.

GEORGE:
If you were late every day, I wouldn't make you feel bad.

SAM:
Again, that doesn't matter.

GEORGE:
Well it should. If you were bad at your job I wouldn't care, and I would still like you. And it would look a little something like this.

[ GEORGE moves his hands and wiggles his fingers.

MAGIC SOUNDS ]

This is what it would look like, this is what it would look like, this is what it would look like...

SAM: [ spinning offstage ]
Oh noooooooooooooooooooooooo!

 SAM EXITS. COURTNEY ENTERS with an easel.

LIGHTS UP.

George strikes a strong pose and Courtney begins painting his portrait. ]  

GEORGE:
Where have you been, Sam? I've been waiting.

SAM: [ offstage, as Courtney moves her mouth ]
I'm sorry. I was the president for 15 hours.

GEORGE:
You don't say! 

SAM:
Everyone else in the line of succession was raptured into heaven while playing Pictionary.

GEORGE:
I didn't hear about the rapture.

SAM:
Well, God changed his mind and everyone was reverse-raptured. So now I'm not the president anymore. So I came to work!

GEORGE:
That is something!

SAM:
Let's get to it! You have such beautiful legs.

GEORGE:
Thank you, Sam.

SAM:
I love you.

GEORGE:
Okay.

SAM:
Wait a minute. Why was I a woman?

GEORGE:
I don't discriminate. In my mind pictures.

SAM:
And I was painting your portrait?

GEORGE:
It was your idea. I don't discriminate.

SAM:
George, in some ways I admire your rich fantasy life, bu ...

GEORGE:
But, you're giving me a promotion. And I accept!

SAM:
See, this is what I'm talking about. I'm not giving you a promotion.

GEORGE:
No, I'm giving you a promotion.

SAM:
George, you can't promote me.

GEORGE:
Sure I can! You've earned it. By giving me a promotion. Now put your brush down and take a break.

SAM:
No, wait -- OK, let's start over.

GEORGE:
I can clean now, Sam?

SAM:
You're fired.

GEORGE:
What's that?

COURTNEY: [ voicing SAM offstage ]
I said you're fired!

[ beat ]

What was that?

I'm turning into a woman?

NO!

[ CURTIS wrenches in pain and freezes. ]

GEORGE:
You see, this is the problem. A 9 to 5 job is the only thing keeping my mind pictures in check. Now that I'm unemployed, things are gonna get pretty weird. My clothes are melting now.

[ He removes his shirt, revealing a face painted on his chest. ]

You see? This is my father. He doesn't like to be seen. Now he's awfully disappointed in us.

[ He begins squeezing his belly. ]

"Hey. Put dat shirt back on. Put dat shirt back on mah face."

[ Curtis unfreezes. ]

COURTNEY:
I need to paint you.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ TRANSITION MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. A WOMAN is standing by a well wearing Depression-era garments, very Bonnie Parker. A COP ENTERS, walks by, EXITS. A groan comes from the well. The cop ENTERS again, curious. ]

WOMAN:
Donnie's down there.

[ Beat. ]

COP:
Ma'am?

WOMAN:
Donnie's down there. An' if there's any kind of god in heaven, he's dead, I tell you that much.

COP:
Donnie?

WOMAN:
My boyfriend. Was my boyfriend, anyhow. Now he's just a big dead son of a bitch at the bottom of a well.

COP:
There's someone down there?

[ Cop tries to get a look. Woman stops him. ]

WOMAN:
Serves him right, the bastard. Twelve years, I give to him. He won't marry me, he can't hold down no honest labor and I give my life to him anyhow. He's no good, mister. Ain't nothin' but a big stinking brute. And when he gets drunk, he gets awful mean. But you know, other times, when he gets drunk...

[ She drifts off, seemingly in a fond reverie. ]

... he falls down a well.

COP:
I'll radio for help.

WOMAN: [grabs him ]
Don't you call nobody, mister officer.  Ain't no emergency response team gonna drag his soul back from hell.

COP:
Uh...

VOICE: [ from well ]
I ain't dead, you god damn demon woman!

WOMAN: [ screams down well ]
Well I wisht you were!

VOICE:
You pushed me down here, you damned succubus!

WOMAN:
Only thing pusht you down was your own goddam drunk and stupid feet!

COP: [ into well ]
Are you all right?

VOICE:
Mister officer, I feel like my guts done busted up on me. My bones is on fire. My brain feels like to a tin cup in a mudslide.

WOMAN:
Now you know what it's like, you bastard!

COP:
Look, I'm going to call for some backup and we're gonna get you out of there.

VOICE:
No no no, mister! Don't you call for nobody! I'll be all right. I can see my way out this well myself when I'm ready.

WOMAN:
He's skeered you gonna drag his no-good ass back off to jail where it belong. Cuz his ass ain't no good. Cuz he's a dumb piece of trash with nothin' better to do but take poor young girls out their homes and tear they hearts to pieces.

VOICE:
Ain't no woman in my life but you, you stupid beautiful bitch!

WOMAN:
I ain't gonna spend my life watchin' the night fall, waitin' for you to come home smellin' of them pool hall floozies!

VOICE:
Oh, I don't need no pool halls, baby. I got my fill of women down here.

WOMAN:
Yer a god-damn liar!

VOICE:
Ooooohooooohoohhh. That feels nice what she done doin' to me.

WOMAN:
Who the hell is down there? Is it Charlene? Keep your hands off my man, you vagrant whore!

VOICE:
There ain't no one down here but me, you damn crazy banshee!

WOMAN:
You stop messin' with my head, you filthy damn coopa-chabra, suckin' all the life out me!

VOICE:
You lost the right to tell me what to do when you pusht me down the damn well!

COP:
All right. That's enough. Everyone take a deep breath; I'm going to call the rescue team.

WOMAN: [ pulls gun ]
You ain't goin' nowhere's to tell nobody nuthin'. He's got his own phone down there he can call the po-lice with but he's too dumb to work it!

VOICE:
These numbers is too small for my fingers. I mash all the wrong ones!

WOMAN:
Aw baby, I miss them fat, fat fingers runnin' through my hair.

VOICE:
Aw, baby, I miss you, too. I wish I ain't never fell down this well.

WOMAN:
I'm-a bake you 500 pies when you break free that well!

VOICE:
Aw, honey, I need me those pies.

WOMAN:
Oh baby, I love you so much. Why is things like this always commin' betwixt us?

VOICE:
Like that time I climbed up a fire pole!

WOMAN:
Or that time I done pushed you from that train!

VOICE:
I swear when I get out this damn well I'm-a make you my wife.

WOMAN:   [ tears welling up ]
Aw, baby! I love you so much. I cannot wait to make sweet love to you in our marital bed! You!

VOICE:
I swear I'ma kiss you and strangle you all at once!

WOMAN:
I'ma kick you in the balls and then use them balls to make me a womb baby! And then one day it'll come out me and it'll be an outside baby, a real person baby!

VOICE:
I'ma be so good to that baby! I'ma share my 500 pies with him.

WOMAN:
I'ma tell that baby the story of how you fell down the well. And then I'ma teach that baby how to drive.

VOICE:
I'ma build a home for us with my bare hands right here at the bottom of this well. And then I'ma build a baby house right next door.

WOMAN:
Our baby be so happy in that baby house. And he come to visit when he's hungry.

VOICE:
Or she.

WOMAN:
AW BABY!

VOICE:
AW BABY!

WOMAN:
You know just what I like!

WOMAN:   [ pointing gun right in MAN's face ]
MARRY US!

[ Cop knocks gun from WOMAN's hand and picks it up and points it at WOMAN ]

COP:
Now, hold it right there.

[ there is a GUNSHOT AND A PING as VOICE shoots the gun out of MAN's hand ]

VOICE:
Did I hit me something?

WOMAN:
Baby, I love the way you shoot!

VOICE:
Wahoo!

WOMAN:

COP:

WOMAN:
I do.

COP:
And do you Donnie, take Jane to be your lawfully wedded wife, for better or for worse, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?

VOICE:
I DO!

COP:
Now, by the power vested in me by the state of Montana, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.

[ Woman wags her tongue in the air and she and man make teenage french kissing noises. They stop and the voice whoops and hollers. There are CELEBRATORY GUNSHOTS from the well. Cop falls down dead. ]

WOMAN:
YOU DEADBLAME IDJUT!

VOICE:
What's wrong, molasses lips?

WOMAN:
You kilt our minister, you dumb son of a monkey!

VOICE:
Why you yellin' at me? You know damn well I gotta shoot my piece in the air on certain auspicious occasions!

WOMAN:
You yellow bellied bastard!

[ They continue to bicker as the LIGHTS FADE. ]

[ MUSIC ]

[ LIGHTS UP. A V/O ANNOUNCEMENT. ]

V/O:
Ladies and gentlemen! Put your hands together for The Beach Boys!

[ THE TWO BEACH BOYS ENTER. ]

BB1:
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

BB2:
Hope you're all having fun. You having fun?

[ Beat. ]

All right.

BB1:
My name is Eddie Vale. I performed on the bass guitar for Al Jardine's Original Beach Boys family.

BB2:
My name is Brad D'Fazio. People call me Brad D. I was on additional percussion -- xylophone, etc. -- for Mike Love's Beach Boys and Friends Reunion Tour.

BB1:
We are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
And we're glad to be here at the 2009 Nucksua County Auto Show. There's a lot of really exciting stuff going on all around us.

BB1:
Cars.

BB2:
That woman over there.

[ Beat. ]

Cars, mostly. You know what I'm talking about.

BB1:
And of course if you know and enjoy songs such as "Little Deuce Coupe" and "Fun, fun, fun" you understand that cars are a big part of The Beach Boys mythos.

BB2:
It's a very inspiring subject matter. Really there's a lot to pull from it.

BB1:
Of course, we were not involved in the writing of those songs.

BB2:
Nor were we part of the original recordings.

BB1:
Come to think of it, I don't think either of us performed those songs on our tours.

BB2:
That is pretty odd when you think about it.    

BB1:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
I want to be very clear, we are not here to perform music.

BB1:
Yes, I think we should get that out of the way up front before there's any confusion. We understand if, in light of this, you may not want to stick around, you may want to go take a look at some of those new Hyundais...

BB2:
The ad in the paper might've been misleading.

BB1:
But, the truth is, neither of us is really that into music anymore.

BB2:
No, not at all. Not at all.

BB1:
After the conclusion of our respective tours of duty, so to speak, we got in touch with each other. Started booking ourselves at various events under the name "The Beach Boys".

BB2:
Figured we had every right to, and no one ever seemed to have a problem with it.

BB1:
Until they actually showed up for the shows, and there was a lot of screaming.

BB2:
Really stressful.

BB1:
Long story short --

BB2:
-- we have been banned from Joe's Crab Shack chain of restaurants.

BB1:
For three months.

BB2:
Longest three months of my life.

BB1:
Anyway.

BB2:
Anyway.

BB1:
We've kind of given up the music thing.

BB2:
That's right. Mostly we're just two friends who enjoy doing things together, now.

BB1:
That's right, so we thought we'd come to the auto show.

BB2:
I like cars.

BB1:
I got no problem with 'em.

BB2:
And we saw this little raised, stage-like area.

BB1:
The very one before you now.

BB2:
And I said, "Eddie?"

BB1:
And I said, "Yes, Brad D?"

BB2:
And I said, "Watch this." And I grabbed the microphone attached to the PA system, and I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, The Beach Boys!"

BB1:
And then we pretty much just jumped up on this stage and started talking.

BB2:
And that pretty much catches you all up to speed, right?

BB1:
There was no ad in the paper.

BB2:
No, that was just me riffing.

BB1:
Anyhow, since we're up here, we might as well talk about some things.

BB2:
Yeah, let you know what we've been up to.

BB1:
We're out of the music game, for one thing.

BB2:
Good riddance.

BB1:
I've been thinking about picking up some new hobbies.

BB2:
I already got cars to tide me over.

BB1:
I want to do the thing you do with the wood you find on the beach, you know?

BB2:
I like crafts.

BB1:
Yeah, things you can do with your hands.

BB2:
Very natural.

BB1:
I don't know what that's called though, so I'm having a hard time finding a book on it.

BB2:
If anyone knows what that's called, you pick up the microphone over there and just holler it out.

BB1:
I see some new people milling around at the edge of the crowd.

BB2:
So if you've just joined us, we're The Beach Boys --

BB1:
-- Eddie and Brad D --

BB2:
-- we don't perform music anymore --

BB1:
-- and we need to know the name of the thing where you take wood from the beach and make an art thing out of it.

BB2:
Uh ... does anyone have any questions?

BB1:
OK, it looks like you guys are kind of dispersing.

BB2:
Yeah, crowd's breaking up a little.

BB1:
Fair enough, fair enough.

BB2:
We really have no particular right to be up here in the first place.

BB1:
Yeah, we didn't have anything to say in particular.

BB2:
This thing we're doing up here has kind of run its course.

BB1:
Now I feel almost like I'm talking just to talk, like I'm locked in the groove.

BB2:
And I'm starting to see that there are some men in badges coming toward us.

BB1:
Probably security officers.

BB2:
Probably. And why not? They're just doing their jobs, we're obviously not a part of this show in any official way...

BB1:
It's pretty clear that we're breaking some rules right now.

BB2:
Not that the auto show necessarily has rules written down somewhere, but I think we can all agree that there's some unspoken rules...

BB1:
Like trash, for example. No rule you gotta put it in the can, but come on.

BB2:
And you don't see anyone else just climbing up on stage and running their mouths, so, I think, shame on us, ultimately.

BB1:
I think we just had an idea that we thought would be fun for us, but we didn't really consider whether it would be fun for other people.

BB2:
We didn't think of the consequences! Didn't think of the consequences.

BB1:
Now we'll probably be fined, in some way.

BB2:
Or sent home, more likely, without seeing as many of these exciting prototypes as I would've liked to.

BB1:
And we're still talking...

BB2:
We're still talking!

BB1:
Which goes to show, we still have a lot of growing up to do, the two of us, in terms of learning from our mistakes.

BB2:
But really, that's for us to figure out. We don't need to burden you by making this a public spectacle.

BB1:
Thankfully, it seems that almost all of you are just walking around now, not really paying attention.

BB2:
And it would appear that our security escort is waving us off the stage.

BB1:
So we'll go quietly.

BB2:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB1:
It's certainly been a pleasure.

BB2:
And, uh ... keep on surfing.

[ THEY EXIT. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

FG2:
I was fucked up, dude.

We were both so fucked up.

FG2:
Everyone got fucked up at that party dude. Everyone.

FG1:

[ Beat. They lock eyes, smile, and exchange a hive five. ]

BOTH:
Wooooooo!

FG1:
So wasted!

[ Beat. ]

FG2:
I think I puked twice, brah.

FG1:
I think I puked at least twice.

FG2:
I was so wasted.

FG1:
Totally.

FG2:
I was so wasted that Chad and I just sat in that couch in the backyard for like an hour. We talked about all the times we've seen together, the passing of our youth, what the future holds for us. And then we seemed to share this deep, silent understanding.

[ Pause. ]

FG1:
So wasted!

FG2:
I know, man! I fucking know!

FG1:
I was so wasted, I went and found Madison. She was outside with that new fucking tool boyfriend of hers. I took her aside and told her how I felt about our relationship. I told her I had let go of my anger because no matter how things fell out between us, I still owed her everything for the tender, innocent love we had shared. And then we held each other, as friends, for what seemed like forever.

[ Pause. Frat Guy 2 whoops and hollers, makes drinking gestures. They high five. ]

FG2:
So. Fucking. Wasted!

FG1:
I was demolished, dude!

FG2:
You were obliterated, dude!

FG1:
I was annihilated.

BOTH:
We both were!

[ Pause. ]

FG2:
Dude, I was so wasted that I called my father.

FG1:
Dude, you are nuts!

FG2:
I totally fucking did, dude! I called my father.

FG1:
You are a fucking animal, dude! You are a fucking mythic animal! You are a fucking gryphon!

FG2:
 I called my fucking father.


FG1:
Fuuuuuuuuck.

FG2:
That's not all, dude.

FG1:
That's not all? There's more?

FG2:
I called my father. And I forgave him.

[ Beat. ]

I forgave him.

[ Beat. ]

Right in his face.

[ Pause. Then an explosion of dudely spirits. ]

FG1:
FUCKING EPIC!

FG2:

SCREWBALL:

SCREWBALL:
Awwwwwwwwwwwwww, you gotta save that for the privacy of your home, ya nutjob!

NUTJOB:
Live and learn!

SCREWBALL:
Well, how'd you get away with it?

NUTJOB:
The cops stopped chasin' me when they realized I was also covered in my own feces.

SCREWBALL:

SULLY
Careful on the ladder, dum-dum.

MEGAN
I’m fine. You’re dumb!

SULLY
Both hands. One rung at a time.

GEORGE
There are actually three valid ways to climb a ladder.

SULLY
When’d you get your Ph.D. in ladders?

GEORGE
I’m talking Alexander Technique. Proper spinal posture. “Keep your back straight as you climb, and to health you’ll be on time.”

MEGAN
God.

GEORGE
I have no back pains, guys.

SULLY
I don’t want Megan cracking his head open like he did at the wake.

MEGAN
I’m sorry if I inconvenienced you with my life-threatening head injury.

GEORGE Megan, you’re the one who tried to jump over the coffin.

MEGAN
I could’ve sworn that someone dared me.

SULLY
You need to go easy on the soda. Caffeine gives you fits.

MEGAN
But they had unlimited refills!

GEORGE
We’re the children of the deceased. We don’t get charged for refills.

[ They enter. George is carrying a Dr. Who Tardis cookie jar, the kind that makes noise when you open it. Megan wears a bandage around his head. ]

SULLY
Well, here we are.

MEGAN
Back in our childhood home.

GEORGE
In our old attic.

ALL [ together, to audience ]
Act one, the old attic.

GEORGE
So many memories.

MEGAN
Old memories.

SULLY
Attic memories.

ALL [ together, to audience ]
Act one, scene one, the old attic memories.

GEORGE
I remember hiding up here with one of Dad’s Screw magazines. It was an old one from his collection. There were some dirty jokes about Billy Carter. I was too young to get anything out of it, but I liked that the ladies seemed so confident about their bodies.

SULLY
Disgusting, George. I used to hide up here too. I went through Nee-Naw’s old trunk. She had this one dress. It was super old and it smelled like cabbage. I would wear it and pretend I was a wild west princess.

GEORGE [ to Megan ]
What about you, Megan? Do you have a special attic memory?

MEGAN
Not really. I used to sneak cabbage up here and wipe it on one of Nee-Naw’s dresses. I don’t remember which one, only the urge to smear cabbage all over it. I was always smearing things on other things. It was how I coped.

SULLY
The smearing fits?

MEGAN
It’s a real condition.

SULLY
Right.

GEORGE
See guys? We’re sharing memories. It’s a gift Dad gave us by dying.

[ To the cookie jar. ]

You were complicated, Dad. As are our feelings for you. Agreed?

SULLY
OK.

GEORGE
But we thank your ghost for the chance to share attic memories.

SULLY
Stop talking to the ashes, George. It’s spooky.

GEORGE
Spirituality is spooky to you?

SULLY
Yes.

MEGAN
Fuck.

GEORGE
What happened?

MEGAN
Nothing, just fuck him.

SULLY
Dad?

MEGAN
Fucking fuck him. I hope he went to hell, like all his fucking heroes. Richard Nixon, Phil Spector, the guy from The Mamas and The Papas.

SULLY
Phil Spector’s not dead.

MEGAN
We spent our lives under that megalomaniac’s thumb, and now we have to fucking spread his ashes in every state in the country! And not an equal amount!

[ Pulls out a contract. ]

He writes up a legally binding contract about how much to spread in every state. “Pennsylvania: 6.7% by weight. Delaware: 4.2% by weight.” If I read this right, we could go to jail if we fuck it up! Like we don’t have our own lives. I could be going to nurse school, or learning Japanese, or maybe just reading a magazine!

[ Sully snatches the contract. ]

SULLY
“I, Ronald Reginald Stepp, being of sound blah blah blah …”

GEORGE
Why are you reading it again?

SULLY
Let’s lay out all the relevant facts. “Bequeath 98% of my financial holdings to the Church of Scientology, with the request that a Level 17 Clarity school be named in my honor, preferably on the moon, if, at the time of my passing, the moon has been colonized.”

MEGAN
Ha! You dead bastard! It never happened! There’s no one living on the moon, daddy!

SULLY
“For the remaining 2% of my holdings, I bequeath them in equal parts to my three children: Sullivan Stepp...

[ Sully raises hand. ]

SULLY
Me. “Georgette Stepp... “

GEORGE
Me.

SULLY
“And, both last and least, Megan Stepp...”

MEGAN
Me! Relevant facts.

SULLY
Relevant facts. “ … Members of the international child band sensation, Ron Stepp presents Ron Stepp and The Stepp Sisters, the band behind hit songs like “Ice Cream Fun”, “Cool Times at The Pool”, “Animal Party in The Barn”, and “Number One Dad”. Band recordings and t-shirts are still available for purchase at this time, and, if the moon has been colonized at the time of my passing, I imagine the recordings are available in low-gravity cassette format. Anyway--”

GEORGE
He used the word “anyway” in his will?

SULLY
“Anyway, my three children shall be legally bound to be present at each state’s distribution of my ashes, hereafter referred to as Stepp Ash.” There’s a TM by “Stepp Ash”.

MEGAN
He copyrighted the term “Stepp Ash”. Copyrighted?

GEORGE
Copywrote?

MEGAN
Copywrought?

GEORGE
… Copyrighted. It looks like the four of us are going on the road.

SULLY
Yeah, the “Ron Stepp Presents The Ron Stepp and The Stepp Sisters Ron Stepp Memorial Tour”.

GEORGE
The Stepp Sisters, together again, rockin’ out across these united states, like the old days, with dad by their side.

[ Raises a finger in the air. ]

GEORGE
A chance for redemption!

MEGAN
What’s with that awful receptacle?

GEORGE
What-acle? Recepta-what? Re-what-cle?

MEGAN
The ashes.

GEORGE
It’s a Tardis. From Dr. Who.

SULLY
Dr. Who?

GEORGE
Who.

MEGAN
The name of the doctor.

SULLY
Third base. Fuck off.

GEORGE
He travels through space and time.

MEGAN
What’s up with it?

GEORGE
Sullivan said that in his last few months, Dad was a huge Dr. Who fan.

SULLY
No. I said that in his last few months, dad’s oncologist was Dr. Hu Phan.

GEORGE
What?

SULLY
The nice Vietnamese guy at the wake.

MEGAN
He was nice.

GEORGE
Dr. Hu Phan?

MEGAN
A fan of what?

SULLY
Dr. Who?

MEGAN
That’s what I’m asking.

SULLY
Third base. Fuck off. 
GEORGE
In any case, it’s a fitting tribute to dad, who was a traveler in his own way, like TV’s Dr. Who.

MEGAN
Is it a cookie jar?

GEORGE
Check it out.

[ George lifts the lid, triggering the sound effect. Sullivan knocks over a stack of boxes. Her drum kit is right behind, all set up and ready to go. ]

SULLY
I found my drums, guys.

[ She gets behind the kit and starts jacking around while the other two continue searching. ]

SULLY
These sticks … My hands. They fit. When I’m holding them, my hands get happy. They make love to the sticks. And the sticks are like, “Yeah? Me too!” And it sounds like this!

[ She does a sweet drum roll. ]

SULLY
Yeah.

ALL [ together, to audience ]
Act two, Sullivan’s story.

SULLY
I’ve spent too much time in the producer’s chair. It’s time to make my own music again. I mean our music.

MEGAN
No, please, it was always your music.

GEORGE
Megan.

MEGAN
Dad liked her best.

SULLY
Right, the old bit. Third base, fuck off.

GEORGE
Dad stole it from the Smothers Brothers.

MEGAN
It’s not just a bit. Dad liked you best. He told us, every day, “I like Sullivan best.” Every day, he would tell us that multiple times.

SULLY
Well, I’m the eldest. I’m actually a girl. He was very disappointed when you two were born as boys. You screwed up the band name.

MEGAN
I was born as a man.

SULLY
He wanted you to be girls.

GEORGE
We know, Sullivan.

SULLY
Like me.

MEGAN
Fine.

SULLY
Why not change your name, if you’re so bitter?

MEGAN
Because fuck him, that’s why!

GEORGE
Angry words lead to an angry heart, Megan. An angry heart is a heavy burden in the chest. Like a vampire, but instead of fear, it feasts on blood. Your blood.

SULLY [ thoughtfully ]
I guess dad probably did like me best.

GEORGE
You let him tell you what to do.

MEGAN
Then you told us what to do.

SULLY
That’s the chain of command.

MEGAN
Families don’t have chain of command! They’re supposed to have hugs, and laughter. They’re supposed to have game nights!

GEORGE
Instead, we had shame nights.

SULLY
Shame nights weren’t so bad.

GEORGE
You never got picked, Sully.

SULLY
Dad made me deputy of shame night. Why would I shame myself? That makes no sense.

MEGAN
You made me walk into Kroger’s with no shirt on. You made me beg the other customers to tell me that I was a chubby boy.

SULLY
You were way too fucking chubby! It was screwing up our look!

GEORGE
Lots of bands have a chubby guy. The chipmunks had Theodore. *NSYNC had that puffy old guy. Fats Domino’s band had some fat guy in it.

SULLY
Our look was streamlined! You made our silhouette too round. You know what Dad said, “Clean lines, clean look, clean sound!”

GEORGE
Sully, remember the car ride. We set a rule about how many times you could appeal to Dad per hour. You’re exceeding it.

SULLY
I tentatively put that rule under consideration.

MEGAN
Of course. The rules don’t apply to Sullivan. Why don’t you tentatively shut the hell up?

GEORGE
Megan, no. That’s not how we respond. We infuse our words with constructive intent.

MEGAN
Fine.

GEORGE
We’re going to visualize our way through this. Breathe deep.

[ They do. ]

GEORGE
Fill your minds with air or water imagery. No earth, definitely no fire.

SULLY
Can there be animals?

GEORGE
No. Unless you want them.

SULLY
I’m visualizing water, but it’s bottled water. I’m thirsty, maybe?

MEGAN
What kind?

SULLY
Fiji.

GEORGE
Please, no brand names. Those will remind you of the worldly cycle of industry and commerce. Practical concerns, very stressful.

SULLY
I could peel the label off.

GEORGE
Please do.

[ Pause. ]

SULLY
OK.

GEORGE
Take that bottle and pour it into a crystalline lake.

[ Pause. ]

SULLY
I spilled some.

GEORGE
That’s OK. How’s the lake?

SULLY
Looks just like a movie lake.

GEORGE
Put a cloud overhead, if you like. A soft cloud over a lake is an ideal visualization. Look at the cloud’s reflection in the lake. It’s shaped like something. Now, it’s changing. Don’t let that cloud change into a shape that’s unpleasant.

MEGAN
My cloud is a perfect horsey.

GEORGE
You’re doing great!

MEGAN
Now the horsey’s going away.

GEORGE
… Well, that might just be part of life.

MEGAN
Come back, horse cloud!

GEORGE
Look, it’s your imagination, so just bring him back if you want to.

MEGAN
He won’t come.

GEORGE
I don’t know what to tell you.

SULLY
I see the cloud reflected in the lake, moving and shifting. I look into the lake. I see my own face. My face changes, like the cloud.

GEORGE
Good! This is elaborate stuff.

SULLY
I reach out to touch it. Oh no! I’m falling through the lake, falling into myself! My heart and mind are going like this!

[ Starts drumming with her eyes closed. ]

GEORGE
I love it!

SULLY
I remember my life after the band. The past fifteen years. The many superb successes of my solo career as a record producer and songwriter.

MEGAN
Here we go.

GEORGE
Hush, Megan. Sully’s going deep into her own soul.

SULLY
I remember how I conquered the music industry with “Falling Pieces”, which I wrote and produced for internet sensation Gladys St. Taco. I’m pretty sure dad has a copy of the video up here because he was always very proud of me!

[ Sully begins searching through boxes in her trance. ]

GEORGE
This is amazing. I’ve never gotten this deep before.

MEGAN
It’s not--

SULLY [ waving arms ]
I’m still falling into myself! I just fell into this DVD!

[ She pulls the DVD out of a box. ]

SULLY
This DVD, still only 9.99 plus shipping and handling on Amazon.com and other online retailers. Let’s watch it now!

[ She throws it at the screen. ]

[ VIDEO: “Falling Pieces” ]

[ Sully comes out of the trance. ]

SULLY
Guys, I just had the strangest dream. Hey, what are we watching? Oh, the song that shot me to wealth and acclaim.

[ Video plays through, finishes. ]

SULLY
How about that? That was how my rise to wealth and acclaim began.

MEGAN
Wait a minute.

[ Megan digs through the box. ]

MEGAN
Are the lyrics in the liner notes?

SULLY
Yeah. I wrote it when Clancy and I got back together.

[ Megan pulls out some liner notes. ]

MEGAN [ reads lyrics ]
“Turn and float and turn and float
A knot is forming in my throat”
Is this song about Tetris?

SULLY
No.

MEGAN
“Sweating palms
clear focused eyes
fumble with the buttons
You'll run out of tries”
This is a song about Tetris. “Fumble with the buttons?”

SULLY
On a shirt. They’re undressing for sex. That’s why you don’t get it. Virgin.

MEGAN
“The pieces
Fall from the sky
Try to make them fit
Before they stack up too high”
You got rich for a song about Tetris.

SULLY
It’s about forever love and its challenges.

MEGAN
“Before they stack up too high?” This is definitely about Tetris.

SULLY
It’s not about Tetris, you turd!

[ They get into a slap fight. George breaks it up. ]

GEORGE
That is enough, you two. Sully! In your trance, did you switch places with an evil version of yourself?

SULLY
No, this is me.

GEORGE
I can’t be sure of that, but OK.

MEGAN
I can’t believe you. What is wrong with you? You just had to rub it in our faces one more time--

[ SOUND: Exercise alarm. ]

[ They do their exercises. ]

CALLER
Face your partner do si do
Swing your partner oh lets go
Promenade till you get back home
Join up hands circle to the left
Circle to the right till you get back home
To the left   to the left 	  to the left   to the left
What?  What?   What?  What?  to the left  to the left
To the right   to the right   to the right   to the right
What you gon do?  What you gon do?   to the right   to the right
Walk with me  take a walk with me   now scream!   (scream)
Here come the men in black the galaxy defenders
Do si do like the men in black They won’t let you remember

MEGAN
Urgh, those damn exercises.

GEORGE
But don’t you feel better?

MEGAN
Not really.

SULLY
We were talking about old times. I thought it would be fun for us to reminisce over the many superb successes of my solo career as a record producer and songwriter.

MEGAN
I get it, Sully! I read Billboard magazine, like everyone else in America does.

GEORGE
Were you really in a trance?

SULLY
Sort of! Remember the world tour I did with Fantastic Fantastic Girl Time? Just me and 17 Korean teenagers. Sellout stadium shows. Lasers. Smoke. Videos. Puppets. We made Pink Floyd’s The Wall look like a piece of stupid shit.

MEGAN
I watched that documentary about your life the other day.

SULLIVAN
What are you tal-

MEGAN
Downton Abbey! A show about stuck-up millionaires back in the wild west days. That’s you, right?

SULLIVAN
I haven’t seen it.

GEORGE
You should!

SULLIVAN
Is it good?

GEORGE [ enthusiastic thumbs up ]
It’s fine!

MEGAN
Why do this reunion, anyway? Can’t your fancy big city lawyer slick-talk you out of dad’s last will and testame-contract?

SULLIVAN
Did you ever consider that George and I enjoyed being in the band?

GEORGE
There are pleasant moments that I remember.

SULLIVAN
See!

MEGAN
That’s because dad didn’t treat you like garbage.

[ Megan goes over to the box where Sullivan found the video. He picks it up, reads from the side of the box. ]

MEGAN
I mean, look at this. “Sullivan’s Triumphs”. There’s an asterisk by “Sullivan”.

[ Follows it down. ]

“Favorite of my children.” Two asterisks.

[ Follows them down. ]

“At this time, I have three children. The other two, who I like less than my eldest daughter, Sullivan, are Georgette and Megan.”

GEORGE [ shaking head ]
Unnecessary.

MEGAN
“Anyway...”

GEORGE
He wrote “anyway” on the box?

MEGAN
Then it trails off.

[ Looks in the box. ]

MEGAN
Dad kept all of your work.

SULLIVAN [ shrugs ]
I sent him copies. When you work on a CD, they give you a few free copies. It’s a courtesy to artists. No big deal ...

[ Megan pulls out another CD, reads the label. ]

MEGAN
“Make You Humble” by The Iron Sheik.

[ Sullivan immediately charges him, shrieks, grabs the CD, and throws it to the ground. Silence. Megan slowly reaches into the box, pulls out another one. Sullivan grabs it and throws it to the ground. Again. ]

GEORGE
Sullivan?

SULLY
Get it away, get it away, get it away!!

MEGAN
What’s your problem? Jesus.

SULLY
NO!!!

[ GEORGE holds Sullivan from behind. ]

MEGAN
Well, this I gotta hear.

[ MEGAN throws the CD in the air. ]

[ SOUND: Iron Sheik song. ]

GEORGE
We’ve got to stop hearing this.

[ Megan stops it. ]

MEGAN
What the hell was that? “The Iron Sheik”?

SULLY
He was a wrestling villain in the 80s.

GEORGE
That’s right! He wrestled for whatever Middle Eastern country was unpopular that year.

MEGAN
Hulk Hogan beat him. The Hulkster.

GEORGE
The U.S. Hulk.

SULLY
The Man of Many Bandanas.

GEORGE
The Iron Sheik recorded an album?

SULLY
A 12-inch dance record. In 2005. He was getting buzz for some popular homophobic rants on YouTube.

MEGAN
You produced a record for The Iron Sheik? Jesus, Sully.

SULLY
People didn’t like it. They didn’t dance.

MEGAN
Sorry, Sully.

GEORGE
We all do things for money. I worked at Arby’s for three years.

SULLY
I lost it.

MEGAN
The Iron Sheik money?

SULLY
There was no Iron Sheik money. It flopped. I lost all the money.

GEORGE
Everything?

SULLY
I spent it all. I had … plans. I was building my own recording studio. 500 acres, underground, in the heart of downtown. 8000 microphones! Thousands of exotic instruments and animals, including three harpsichords of different sizes. 200 boards with switches and things! Places to sit! Cords and cables and wires! Fully staffed Starbucks! A partially staffed Wolfgang Puck bistro! Six showers, each with three microphones!

GEORGE
The heart of downtown?

SULLY
I wanted to capture the beat of the city. That rhythm of walking across a street or looking at a building! The tempo of lunch hour!

MEGAN
Is this why we don’t have good mass transit?

SULLY
Yes. The studio blocks hundreds of potential train routes.

GEORGE
Is this why there’s a big sinkhole in the middle of the industrial tapas district?

SULLY
It also causes dozens, maybe hundreds of sinkholes. It’s abandoned now. Nothing down there but bats and mole people.

MEGAN
Real mole people?

SULLY
No, these are just people who have lost their eyes after centuries of living underground.

GEORGE
You don’t have anything left?

SULLY
I was supposed to work on Stone Cold Steve Austin’s new album, Having a Stone Cold Jam. I wrote a song for him, “Giving You The 1-2-3”. It didn’t work out. I need this tour, guys.

GEORGE
Wow. Your self-aggrandizing turned into a humble confession so quickly.

SULLY
It did, didn’t it?

MEGAN
We’ve learned something about you, Sully.

GEORGE
We might learn something about each of us tonight.

[ George looks behind a couple of boxes. ]

GEORGE
Hey! It’s my bass guitar! It’s already plugged in. Keyboard kitty is here too, Megan!

[ Hands keyboard cat to Megan. ]

MEGAN
You guys want to play?

SULLY
Let’s go back to the beginning, guys. When things were simpler.

GEORGE
“Animal Party in The Barn”?

MEGAN
Our first single.

SULLY
Let’s do it!

[ They play. ]

MEGAN [ sings ]
Animal party in the barn
Animal party in the barn
All the animals are having a party
It’s an animal party in the barn

Animal party in the barn
Animal party in the barn
Where’s the party? It’s in the barn.
Animal party in the barn

Animal party in the barn
Animal party in the barn
All these animals are party animals
Animal party in the barn

MEGAN
This song is not very good.

SULLY
Dad wasn’t the world’s greatest songwriter.

GEORGE
There’s no detail. All we know is that these animals are at a party in the barn. We don’t know which animals. We don’t know what they’re doing.

MEGAN
Think of “The Monster Mash”. It’s evocative. This guy is working in his lab, it’s late, it’s just another night, and then this monster party breaks out. And there are stories of what happen at the party! Specific things, not just generalizations. Let’s take another shot. I think I can juice these lyrics up a bit.

[ They play. ]

MEGAN [ sings ]
Well, I was sleepin’ in the farmhouse, late one night
A noise from the barn gave me a fright
Peeked through the window and I see
The animals havin’ a big par-ty!

[ They stop. ]

GEORGE
That’s the same scenario as “Monster Mash”, though. Guy sees a weird party late at night, and it gives him “a fright.”

SULLY [ pulls lyric sheet out of pocket ]
I re-wrote lyrics for this song, but dad didn’t like them. He said they were too literary.

MEGAN
Dad said no to you?

SULLY
All the time. Behind closed doors. That’s the chain of command.

GEORGE
Let’s try them.

[ They play. Megan sings the song with Sullivan’s lyrics now. ]

MEGAN
Animal party in the barn
Animal party in the barn
All the animals were invited
To the animal party in the barn

Animal party in the barn
Animal party in the barn
Everybody went except for the farmer
He wasn’t invited to the barn

Animal party in the barn
Animal party in the barn
Everybody had a really good time
And they all fell in love

MEGAN
Party?

SULL and GEORGE
Party!

MEGAN
Animal!

SULL and GEORGE
Party! Party!
They all fell in love all fell in love all fell in love
They all fell in love all fell in love all fell in love
They all fell in love all fell in love all fell in love

The animals had a good time
The horses liked the cows
Everyone got along during the
Party in the barn

MEGAN
Meat?

SULL and GEORGE
Party!

MEGAN
No meat?

SULL and GEORGE
Party! Party!

No one was killed for meat that day for meat that day
No one was killed for meat that day for meat that day
No one was killed for meat that day for meat that day
No one was killed for meat that day for meat that day
They all started fucking etc...

SULLY
That felt great.

MEGAN
You must have been 12 when you wrote these lyrics. What’s with all the sex?

SULLY
I was reading “Flowers In The Attic”.

GEORGE
Guys, I have to sit down a minute.

ALL
Act Three, George’s Story.

GEORGE
I just started a new cleanse...

[ SULLY and MEGAN groan. GEORGE starts drinking a concoction. ]

SULLY
Jesus, George, that smells terrible.

GEORGE
My organicist put me on it. Six times a day I drink a mixture of water, apricot oil, corn meal, amaranth paste and ketchup. It opens me up so I can efficiently absorb important vitamins and minerals.

MEGAN
Sounds great.

SULLY
What happened to your vegetablist?

GEORGE
He was a quack. His “solution” to everything was eating more vegetables. He was just a tool for the vegetable lobbyists.

MEGAN
There is no vegetable lobby, George. We eat an appallingly small amount of vegetables as a society.

GEORGE
That guy had no interest in helping me get better. He had samples of vegetables ON HAND. You know some hot, young vegetables rep was there earlier in the week with an armful of vegetables and an “incentive” check to get him to pass vegetables out to his patients.

SULLY
You’re just mad that what this guy was telling you to do wasn’t a fad cleanse that you could pretend would solve your problems in two weeks.

MEGAN
Which, according to you, include: no stomach lining, reflux diarrhea, backwards throwups, the inability to process melons, chronic appendicitis, chlorophyll intolerance, brittle teeth, flat feet, reverse memory loss, stomach migraines, and an allergy to fish so severe that looking at one in an aquarium gives you hives and lockjaw.

GEORGE
I think you left a few out...

MEGAN
What does Swami Wigwam say about all this?

GEORGE
Swami Mittal. I dumped Swami Mittal.

SULLY
What? You were studying under that guy for 12 years! You went to India to meet his family! You were his servant for six months. You had to empty and clean his chamber pot!

GEORGE
All he ever wanted to do was stretch. That was his solution to everything. Stress, stretch, anger, stretch, boredom, stretch. It was boring! Plus it aggravated my nasal worms. It made them all restless.

SULLY
When did this all start, George? All these imaginary ailments?

GEORGE
I’ve always been like this.

MEGAN
I remember when.

SULLY
You do?

MEGAN
That school Christmas assembly. Dad “booed” your solo on “Oh Come, All Ye Faithful”.

SULLY
Yeah!

GEORGE [ looking through a box, pulling out old newsletters, half paying attention ]
I don’t remember that.

SULLY
You stayed on your exercise bike for three days straight after that. You went to the bathroom on it.

GEORGE
You must be thinking about Megan.

MEGAN
I didn’t have a solo. I was a horse in the manger.

GEORGE
I don’t remember that, sorry.

SULLY
Booing you got Dad kicked out of the PTA. In fact, it got him banned for life from any PTA in the world, ever.

GEORGE
No, Dad was VERY active in PTA while we were in school.

SULLY
He started his own PTA from our house that no one joined. George, he was BANNED from our elementary school campus for SEVERAL years.

GEORGE [ looking closely at the newsletter ]
What’s an Ombudsman?

MEGAN
Don’t change the subject.

GEORGE
What’s an Ombudsman do?

MEGAN
You just don’t want to admit that a single act from our shit father changed you into the neurotic open wound that you are today.

SULLIVAN
An ombudsman is like a liaison between two groups, I guess. Why?

GEORGE
I found some of our old band newsletters! Let’s focus on this now!

SULLIVAN
Okay?

GEORGE
This is great! “Sullivan Stepp Executive Editor, Georgette ‘George’ Stepp Editor-in-Chief, Megan Stepp Ombudsman.” Guys remember? Megan was the Ombudsman?

MEGAN
It just meant I would deliver notes from dad and make sandwiches.

GEORGE
“Extra, Extra! Ron Stepp Declared Best Dad in the Universe!”

MEGAN
George.

GEORGE
Look! The sports section! “Stepp Sisters Shoot Some HORSE!”

SULLY
George!

GEORGE
We even had advertisers! The One-Stop Shop. “Buy one slurpee, get two free!” We used that coupon so many times. That’s still a heck of a deal!

MEGAN
Stop avoiding the subject George!

[ MEGAN grabs the newsletter and GEORGE flips out and tears it up ]

GEORGE
I’m not a stupid baby!

SULLY
No one said you were!

GEORGE
I’m not a baby, I don’t wear a diaper! I don’t drink formula! Oh, god, all this yelling, it’s making me....

[ GEORGE grabs his chest ]

SULLY
Should I call 911?

GEORGE
No! No, it’s just my heart farts.

MEGAN
What?

GEORGE
Heart farts. It’s not made up! Digestive acid gets in your heart and gets pumped through your bloodstream. It’s as painful and unnerving as three heart attacks simultaneously. Fortunately, doctors have reassured me that, good news, it’s not dangerous and also completely in my head.

MEGAN
Right, heart farts.

GEORGE
That’s why there’s no medicine for it!

MEGAN
Fair enough.

GEORGE
Oh, god, it hurts! I’m seeing a light!

SULLY
George, you can’t be dying if it’s all in your head! Visualize, like you said! Imagine your heart fart is a cloud above a lake. Change the shape, George!

GEORGE
No! Stage lights! I’m on a stage … in a cafetorium! Oh god, I  remember! He’s booing me, he’s in the front row. He’s booing me and he’s trying to get the other parents to boo me, too. He’s trying to get them to pull the lights! He’s screaming at the music teacher: she’s playing the piano and he’s throwing her sheet music all over the stage. The principal is here with the gym teacher, Coach Fred. They’re pulling dad down the aisles and he’s screaming and fighting! I can hear Dad screaming in the courtyard. They’ve called the cops.

[ GEORGE picks up a box and repeatedly throws it in the air so he can punch it out of the air. He does this over and over during this next bit. ]

GEORGE
Why, Dad!? My balls hadn’t dropped yet! It was physically impossible for me to hit those low notes! Why did you hate us?! Why did you treat us like animals, ringing a bell when it was time to eat and sometimes when it wasn’t time to eat so that our mouths would water and you could laugh? Why? Why did you sabotage our floats in the neighborhood Fourth of July parade EVERY YEAR? Oh god, it’s all coming back!

[ GEORGE is crumpled on the ground. ]

[ SOUND: Exercise alarm. ]

[ They do the exercise. ]

MEGAN
Damn it! I can’t believe that shit still works on us. I mean, how--

SULLY
Hey, but George was getting into it. How are your heart farts?

GEORGE [ slowly looking up ]
They’re better! No! They’re gone!

SULLY
All you had to do was stop repressing your memories and do dad’s oppressive squaredance calisthenics.

GEORGE
Hey, can we do “Not Polite”? I wanna get this aggression out.

[ MEGAN hands out copies of a script to everyone. ]

MEGAN
I found some of our old stage scripts.

SULLY
Holy shit.

GEORGE [reading ]
We’re Ron Stepp Presents The Stepp Sisters!

MEGAN [reading ]
We’re honored to perform for so many terrific fans. That means you guys!

GEORGE [ reading ]
You’re all perfect, in your own special way!

SULLY [ throwing the script away, as does everyone else ]
But you know what? We need to thank someone else who’s also pretty special. He’s the man who put the “Ron Stepp” into “Ron Stepp Presents The Stepp Sisters”.

MEGAN
As well as the “presents” and “The Stepp Sisters.”

GEORGE
None of this would be possible without this man.

SULLY
He gave us physical form.

MEGAN
He wrote the banter we use to introduce this song.

GEORGE
Not to mention that he wrote the song!

SULLY
That’s right, he’s our dad, Ron Stepp.

GEORGE
We love you, daddy!

MEGAN
Yes, Daddy … we love you.

SULLY
But you should know … if you ever have anything mean to say about our dad, you’ll have to deal with us … in a KNIFE FIGHT!

[ They play NOT POLITE. ]

MEGAN
We don’t spit.

SULLY AND GEORGE
Cuz it’s not polite!

MEGAN
We don’t swear.

SULLY AND GEORGE
Cuz it’s not polite!


MEGAN
We don’t yell indoors.

SULLY AND GEORGE
Cuz it’s not polite!

MEGAN
But you make fun of our dad

SULLY AND GEORGE
You just started a fight!

ALL
Knife fight knife fight knife fight knife fight!

MEGAN
We follow the rules.

SULLY AND GEORGE
That’s what you’re s’posed to do!

MEGAN
We do what we’re told

SULLY AND GEORGE
That’s what you’re s’posed to do!

MEGAN
We go to bed on time.

SULLY AND GEORGE
That’s what you’re s’posed to do!

MEGAN
But you make fun of our dad.

SULLY AND GEORGE
You just started a knife fight!

ALL
Knife fight, knife fight, knife fight!

[ Song ends ]

GEORGE
Remember when dad was into punk music for, like, five minutes?

SULLY
I remember us getting our tattoos removed a week after we got them.

MEGAN
But you can’t really remove a tattoo. You can only sort of smudge it.

ALL
Act four, Megan’s story.

MEGAN
Sometimes I wonder how life would have been different without this fucking band.

GEORGE
I know what you mean.

MEGAN
What kind of kid would I have been?

GEORGE
Maybe you would have been exactly the same.

SULLIVAN
You did very well for yourself Megan.

MEGAN
Funny.

GEORGE
You’ve had a very interesting life outside of the family.

MEGAN
That’s all well and good, but what if I could have been happy?

[ Megan looks through the box. ]

GEORGE
You can be happy. You just have to accept who you are and know that what you’re doing, no matter what it is or who it affects, is OK because it’s you who’s doing it and it’s what you’ll always do because it’s you. That’s Taoism.

[ Megan pulls three scrolls from the box. Each scroll is rolled, tied with a ribbon, and hanging off the ribbon is a tag. Each tag is marked with one of the Stepp sisters’ names. ]

MEGAN
What are these?

GEORGE
Dad had scrolls?

SULLIVAN
Dad got into scrolls after he lost interest in punk rock. There’s one for each of us.

[ Megan distributes them. They unroll them and begin reading. ]

GEORGE
It’s dad’s handwriting. Mine says “Georgette is overly sensitive.  Publicly shaming him will lead to paranoia manifested as hypochondria. With the correct dosage of humiliation, he will create imaginary diseases like reflux diarrhea. He will flirt with spirituality to avoid emotional responsibility.”

MEGAN
What are these?

GEORGE
I’m not-- I mean I have my own--

MEGAN
Sull?

SULLIVAN
“Sullivan is being groomed for success. By ranking her as Deputy of Shame Night and making it clear she is her brothers’ superior, I have prepared her for leadership roles. She will quickly succeed. With my constant support, she will develop delusions of grandeur. She will not know how to deal with success and then quickly fail.”

MEGAN
What is this?

SULLIVAN
That was pretty dead on. How did he do that?

GEORGE
Megan?

MEGAN
“Megan does the opposite of everything I say, making him the easiest to manipulate. At the age of thirty-five he will realize that he has never been happy. He will struggle with the idea that he was never in control of anything and that he is still being controlled. Eventually his bitterness towards me will lead to a meltdown and he’ll lose everything. Yeah, not much to him really.”

SULLY
Well, this is pretty messed up.

GEORGE
Our childhood was an experiment.

SULLIVAN
He was right about everything.

MEGAN
It was a failed experiment from a failure of a father.

GEORGE
But he was right.

MEGAN
Not about me.

SULLIVAN
Well, he’s right about you always going against him. He forbade you to go to law school. And then you went to law school.

MEGAN
He ruined my childhood so that I would become a civil rights attorney? And I’m supposed to be thankful?

GEORGE
You did it in spite of him and that’s very Taoist. Just be proud of your accomplishments.

SULLIVAN
He wasn’t right about everything. You haven’t had a meltdown. You haven’t lost everything.

MEGAN
I’ve been stripped of my civil rights attorney certification.

SULLIVAN
What happened?

MEGAN
I was working this civil rights case, see. And there was this civil rights judge I was presenting the civil rights case to, right? And he looked just like dad. Could have been his twin brother.

SULLIVAN
So.

MEGAN
So. He called me son.

GEORGE
So.

MEGAN
His exact words were, “Great job, son.”

SULLIVAN
So.

MEGAN
So. I called him dad.

GEORGE
So.

MEGAN
So. It was more of a scream. I screamed dad at him.

SULLIVAN
So.

MEGAN
So. I screamed dad at him over and over, again and again as I tried to stab him in the eyes with a ballpoint pen.

SULLIVAN
And?

MEGAN
He was much stronger than he looked. And he stripped me of my civil rights law practitioner’s license as the cops escorted me out.

GEORGE
OK. But you’ve still got your commercial pilot’s license, right? Dad forbade you and you did it anyway.

MEGAN
Of course. I’m the best goddamn commercial civil rights pilot in North America!

SULLIVAN
That’s right!

MEGAN
I have trophies!

GEORGE
Great!

MEGAN
I’m no longer allowed on any commercial aircraft!

SULLIVAN
Megan!

MEGAN
I had to FedEx myself here in a crate.

GEORGE
What happened?

MEGAN
The civil rights air traffic control tower ordered me to land the civil rights plane I was civil rights piloting. I had this flashback to when dad would scream in my face when I would play Top Gun on the NES. “Push the buttons right, you idiot!” Landing on the aircraft carrier was impossible. I snapped. I flew in circles until we ran out of fuel. We crashed in a pee-pee reservoir. I almost went to prison. It was all over the news. I’m surprised you guys haven’t heard about this yet.

GEORGE
Shit! But ... what about your medical research? On top of everything else, you’re a brilliant medical researcher?

MEGAN
I was getting close to the cure for cancer. Then I heard dad’s diagnosis. So this time I just quit.

SULLIVAN
What are you going to do?

MEGAN
My idea for an alternative underwater diving equipment and certification process is coming along. I’ll focus on that.

SULLIVAN
An alternative to SCUBA?

MEGAN
I thought the SCUBA process was way too bureaucratic.

GEORGE
What are you calling it?

MEGAN
PSST.

[ George and Sullivan lean in expecting a whisper. ]

MEGAN
It stands for Personal Submersion SCUBA Tank.

GEORGE
You use SCUBA in the name for the alternative to SCUBA?

MEGAN
What else am I going to call it? I sleep in a fucking ice machine!

GEORGE and SULLIVAN
What?

MEGAN
I lost the house. The start up funds for PSST ate through my savings after I lost my many jobs. I couldn’t pay my house mortgage. Now I sleep in an ice machine at the Motel 6.

SULLIVAN
Why?

MEGAN
I unplug it every morning at 10am. The ice melts and I climb in at sunset. I have to be out by 5am when the janitor makes his rounds and plugs it back in.

GEORGE
I’m so sorry.

SULLIVAN
Yeah, but why?

MEGAN
That’s my life now. So thanks, number one dad.

SULLY
Do you want to play that song?

MEGAN
Why the fuck would I want to do that?

GEORGE
Use it, Megan. Infuse the lyrics with subtle irony.

MEGAN
OK.

[ They play “Number 1 Dad”. ]

MEGAN
I’m so glad
That you’re our dad
We’ve had
So much fun
And if I had to count it all out to you
I’d count up to one!

La la la number one dad
La la la number one dad
Number one
Just one
And I’m done
Cuz you’re number one

That’s right
It’s OK
The man who makes our troubles
Go ‘way

La la la number one dad
La la la number one dad

ALL [ Punchy ]
He’s tall
So strong
And he’s never wrong

Because he’s lived
So long
And he’s seen
So much
And we’ll give it all
Because he’s the one

The one who raised us up
The one who dreamed our dreams
The one who’ll take us there
The one who believes

La la la number one dad
La la la number one dad

Ron Stepp, our father, is the world’s number one DAAAAAAAAAAD

MEGAN
Fuck this song.

GEORGE
Megan, you have to let it go.

SULLIVAN
Please Megan. Listen to George.

MEGAN
I don’t know how.

GEORGE
It happens by accident, Megan. Like me ten minutes ago when I remembered that stuff that dad did and then I let it all go. By accident. That’s psychology and Taoism.

SULLIVAN
You have to fake it till you make it.

GEORGE
Pretend everything is fine until your accidental peacemaking arrives.

SULLIVAN
This is really healthy, Megan.

GEORGE
Visualize your rage and bitterness towards Dad as a fiery ball. It’s burning out of control, but you have to contain it. Visualize the fire ball shrinking to the size of a pea. Then you swallow it.

MEGAN
I’ll show you healing. I wrote new lyrics to “Number One Dad.”

GEORGE
You’re going to change dad’s lyrics?

SULLIVAN
But that was his masterpiece.

GEORGE
He said again and again “This is my Mr. Holland’s Opus.”

MEGAN
Well, I’m changing it. The song is called “Number 10 Dad!”

[ Megan points aggressively at the Tardis. ]

SULLIVAN
Number 10 dad?

MEGAN
Yeah. You’re such a horrible father you’ve been pushed back to number 10.

GEORGE
Being 10th best dad is still really good.

MEGAN
But think of how humiliating it is to just know it happened.

[ They all look at the Tardis. ]

You’ve been demoted.

SULLIVAN
It’s not much of a demotion.

MEGAN
The point is --

GEORGE
You are wounded, Megan. We’re all wounded. And it hurts. Doesn’t it? And you know who did the hurt-wounding. And now you can’t hurt new wounds into the person who wounded your hurts because his wounds from all that cancer hurt him to death.

MEGAN
I need the world to know that Ron Stepp was not the number one dad.

SULLIVAN
For the sake of artistic curiosity, let’s hear the new lyrics.

MEGAN [ Reading ]
La la la la la you’re now number 10 dad.

GEORGE
Think how many dads are behind number 10, though.

MEGAN
You thought you were rad as our dad

GEORGE
Probably a lot.

MEGAN
But as a dad you were bad.

SULLIVAN
A whole lot.

MEGAN
Then I’ll change it to number 100 dad.

SULLIVAN
I think that’s still doing all right. How many people are dads?

GEORGE
Google it.

MEGAN
I’m not your Google slave, so don’t tell me what to Google. I’ll Google whatever the hell I want. No one controls Megan Stepp! You hear me? No one can tell me what to do and expect results. You know why? Because nothin’ doin’ on my end, George! Nothin’ doin’.

MEGAN
You see what I mean? He’s still controlling us! From his fucking Tardis he’s controlling us! Making us do these goddamn dances!

[ Megan grabs the Tardis urn. ]

Fuck you, you prick. You were a terrible father. You were a rotten human being. You never even gave me a hug. At the end, I hope you were scared and in pain!

[ He shakes the urn until he is covered in the ashes. ]

SULLIVAN
Looks like you finally got that hug.

[ He screams and runs offstage. ]

GEORGE
Megan, remember proper ladder technique!

[ Crashing sound. ]

SULLIVAN
Megan? Are you OK?

[ Sullivan runs offstage after Megan. ]

GEORGE [ Looks in the box. Pulls out an envelope. Written on the envelope is “letter from the stupid woman.” ]
What’s this?

[ LIGHTS DOWN for a brief set change. ]

[ LIGHTS UP on Megan sitting in a hospital room, wearing a robe. He is smiling a ridiculously huge smile. George and Sullivan enter. ]

GEORGE
This is a nice hospital.

SULLIVAN
Megan, are you OK?

MEGAN
I’m fine!

GEORGE
You look … happy.

MEGAN
I am happy! The doctor said hitting my head the second time caused a rare type of brain damage with no effect other than total happiness.

SULLIVAN
That’s great! I guess.

GEORGE
How do you feel about dad, though?

MEGAN
Now it doesn’t matter that dad made me miserable. You could say I’ve come to terms with having an emotionally abusive father. Hey, what’s that?

GEORGE
It’s a letter, Megan. From our mother. It explains everything. We don’t have three different mothers who all died during childbirth.

SULLIVAN
We have one mother and she is still alive. She’s been trying to find us. When we were on tour, it was dad running from her.

GEORGE
We wrote her a letter right away and we just got this one in response.

MEGAN
You didn’t call her?

SULLIVAN
No, that’s stupid. We can meet up with her on the Ron Stepp Presents The Ron Stepp and The Stepp Sisters Ron Stepp Memorial Tour.

MEGAN
That sounds great! As we close the book of our miserable past we open a new book about finding our mom and having nice times together.

GEORGE
I like books. I loved “Dragon Tattoo”. I like TV Guide.

SULLIVAN
The Stepp Sisters are back, better than ever.

MEGAN
We’re the number one siblings.

SULLY
You mean top three siblings?

MEGAN
No! Number one siblings!

[ They sing while they form a line with arms on each others shoulders. ]
Number one for loving
Number one in hugging
Never forgetting
We’re the number one siblings

A sister and two brothers
There are no others
From the roof of a building
We’ll shout number one siblings!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ LIGHTS UP ]

[ SOUND: Ren faire music ]

[ A mother and son, two Ren Faire workers, are leaning against a tree. He plays with a concertina. ]

SON: Mother, when is the Mud Show?

MOTHER: My darling, if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times, the Mud Show is at 4:45.

SON: But mother, certainly it has been 4:45 by now.

MOTHER: If it had been 4:45, my son, the Mud Show would have happened.

SON: Mother, how do we know the mud show is at 4:45?

MOTHER: It has been prophesied, my love. The great one came down from on high and scrawled uponst a plank of wood “Mud Show at 1:30, 3 and 4:45” for all to read and know.

SON: What was the mud show at 1:30 like, mother?

MOTHER: It was glorious, filled with pratfalls, Shakespeare talk and witty puns.

SON: Shakespeare talk, like we talk now?

MOTHER: Yes, with these fine accents.

SON: Mother, what was the 3pm show like?

MOTHER: It was good in its own way, not as energetic as the 1:30 show but with a more steady, concentrated pace.

SON: I wish I could remember the mud shows.

[ SOUND: Golf swing. ]

SON: Mother, look out!

MOTHER:  [ protects him with her body ] Fore, my child! Regard thee of this fore!

[ Tech person throws a golf ball at the stage. ]

MOTHER: Fifteen years we have been here. Fifteen years ago a wealthy merchant of estates cameth unto our lands and said he wished to appropriate it for a game.

SON: The Golf Course, right, Mother?

MOTHER: Yes, my son, the Golf Course.

SON: What happened when they told us we’d have to abandon our homes?

MOTHER: We stayed and showed them that we wouldn’t simply let our lands be taken from us, the beautiful lands of the Lady of The Lago Renaissance Fair. Twenty three acres of authentic Renaissance era entertainment! Fire eaters! Stilt walkers! The “Dragon’s Den” e-Cigarette Vaping Lounge, sponsored by Blu! Miles and miles of the weirdest cleavage you’ve ever laid your eyes on!

SON: But they built the Golf Course, anyway, right, Mother?

MOTHER: They did, and they called it Mar-A-Lago, which stands for Male Association of Recreation and Lusting After Grabbing Opportunities. All of which is a metaphor for golf. Now it is a meeting place for the richest, most important, and overall best people in the world. And we live in this forest hazard, secretive, silent.

[ He plays the concertina. ]

SON: Mother, tell me about the time your corset burst!

[ Courtney slaps him. ]

MOTHER: No! It is not for your ears! Anyhow, it is too sad a story to repeat.

SON: Did Father leave us to join the Game of Golf?

MOTHER: He did, my son, he did. He left and became a businessman. One day, it is foretold that he will return to us for the 4:45 mud show. But until then, he provides for us. Every few days he takes a nine iron and volleys some shitty food our way.

SON: Sometimes I hear him curse, early in the morning while golfing, probably with buddies.

MOTHER: I hear them too, my son. They are the sound of a man going nuts.

SON: Mother, what happened to my sister Danielle?

MOTHER: We speak not of Danielle.

SON: Was Danielle carried off by the falcons the falconer left behind?

MOTHER: If the man left without his falcons, then he is no falconer.

SON: He left a falcon with its hood on. One day Danielle and I took its hood off. The next day Danielle was gone.

MOTHER: That man is no falconer.

[ Pause. The following is rapid fire. ]

SON: Mother, what’s a goth?

MOTHER: Inside folk.

SON: Mother, what is glass blowing?

MOTHER: The noblest of professions.

SON: Mother, what is a Trekkie?

MOTHER: An interloper who thinks he is clever.

SON: Mother, who is the Doctor?

MOTHER: Such a good guy.

SON: Mother, what is steampunk?

MOTHER: Blasphemy, unless the Doctor is involved.

SON: Mother, what is vaping?

MOTHER: A rad thing that is cool to do anywhere.

SON: Mother, did you lie with a juggler after father left?

[ Courtney slaps him. ]

MOTHER: Oh, my son, I am too weary for any more questions. Would that we had some sustenance to maintain us, like in the golden days! Some Kettle Corn, a Lemon Chill or a Gyro bowl! AAARRGGH, the pangs of hunger joust me!

SON: Hark, mother! Two golfaniers approacheth!

MOTHER: Into the forest hazard retreat we now! Shakespeare away!

ALL: Chaaaaange clothes!

[ Switch to two golfers. ]

[ M takes a pastry and hits it offstage with a club. ]

M: Fore!!

[ Whispering. ]

M: Eat well today, my dear ones. I baked you something special today, which we’ll hear about later.

[ Back to business. ]

M: Do you know why I brought you here?

W: It’s a third interview for a vice president-level position. First interview is a phone call from a moving BMW. Second interview is over lunch where we drink three alcohol drinks, have six bites of cobb salad, and leave the waiter a stamp for a tip to remind him of his place.

M: And …?

W: And a note that says, “Here’s a stamp. Send a letter to your mom and tell her that you’re still a loser. Remember your place! Love, two businesspeople.”

M: Businessmen. Do you know why you made it this far, Danielle?

W: I’m a strong woman who leans in and does serious business things.

M: You know, long ago, in a different life, I had a daughter named Danielle.

W: That sounds a lot like my story. Nevertheless, that probably wasn’t me.

M: Probably not. Are you divisional vice president material, Danielle? Are you a strong enough woman to become a true businessman?

W: I am a strong female character. I am great at karate and dedicated to my mission. I am strong enough as a woman to be a man, like the deodorant I wear. And, like I said, I lean the fuck in.

M: Good profanity! You’re the first woman to ever even step foot on this golf course, Danielle. Look around you. The golf course is for men. A sacred place where buddies can go nuts together.

W: I want to go nuts, like a real golf buddy!

M: Being buddies and going nuts is a privilege of the greens. Do you know where the word golf comes from, Danielle? It’s an acronym. It means gentlemen only, ladies forbidden.

W: That’s a myth. I looked it up on Snopes dot com.

M: Snopes dot com is controlled by businessmen, Danielle. Dot com. Dot commercial. Commerce. Business. Businessmen.

W: Snap!

M: Do you know why ladies are traditionally forbidden from the golf course?

W: I’m sure we did something to deserve it.

M: The links are a garden. Long ago, there was another garden, where two golf buddies went nuts whenever they liked. They were named Adam and Steve.

W: I KNEW it was Adam and Steve, but church people kept telling me that it wasn’t.

M: One day, Steve sliced badly and cursed God. In retribution, God gave him a womb to sicken his mind and turn him toward evil. From that day, he was known as Eve. Because of Eve’s sickly womb, Eden’s 18 holes were lost. Do you understand?

W: I do.

[ M pulls out an e-cig and starts vaping. ]

W: What a great thing to do here.

M: This is a great thing to do anywhere!

W: There’s no reason not to do that any place.

M: Now, do you understand why I was hesitant to bring you here?

W: Yes. As a woman, I am unlike an e-cigarette. I don’t belong everywhere.

M: Good.

W: But perhaps, as a strong woman who knows karate, I can become more than a woman. Let me update you on my current feelings about golf.

M: Ah, ah, ah--feelings are for wombs.

W: [beat, as she considers] Let me tell you why golf is the greatest game--it makes me strong.

M: Good, good.

W: When I golf I can feel the power of business flowing through my club, into my hands, making me stronger.

M: You can call it a golf club once you belong to the golf club. Until then, you may only point to it.

W: I feel this thing making me strong. I feel my womb melting away. With every swing, I feel business taking its place in my belly.

[ She swings the club. ]

W: Out with the womb, in with the business.

M: They say these are very exciting times for female businessmen. You’re making incremental gains in management culture, and you’ll have five years to enjoy them before our entire system and way of life violently collapses.

W: I’ve dreamed of making vice president just in time to see the acidic ocean waters flooding our cities from the window of my corner office.

M: Have you always dreamed of the business life?

W: As long as I can remember. In 1999, I was adopted by a kindly group of business monks. I had amnesia and was living in an oversized falcon’s nest eating raw field mice. They took me to their secluded business temple high in the mountains and showed me the ways of business.

M: This golf course has been here since 1999. Before that …

[ He gazes into the distance. ]

M: Hmmm. Huh. Aaaaah. Hm.

W: It was what? Why are you gazing?

M: I can’t say! Hm. Danielle, would you believe it if I told you that business fate had brought you here today?

W: Sure.

M: You don’t think business fate is just … a beautiful dream? Something out of story books?

W: Snopes dot com says that some story books are real books.

M: Business fate is a mysterious force that shapes the lives of businessmen. It separates us from the lesser people: secretaries, hotel staff, congressmen. Those who toil with filthy hands. Peons.

W: [ pointing ] Like those peons?

M: Those caddies?

W: Hmmm...no. Cubbies. I choose to call them cubbies.

M: Excellent! They are whatever you wish them to be.

W: I wonder what kind of garbage their little cubbie minds are occupied with.

M: Let’s find out.

[ They switch to being caddies. ]

CUBBY 1: Ugh, man. Picking up balls, all day and night. Toiling with our dumb hands.

CUBBY 2: Yup.

CUBBY 1: Let’s have a conversation. Have you seen the Great British Bake Off?

CUBBY 2: No! What’s it about?

[ SOUND: Scary futuristic music. ]

CUBBY 1: Well, in the not too distant future England has separated itself from the European Union. Not only does it break the financial and legal ties it had with the EU, England has physically broken itself off from Europe. The great Brexit. The island floats free through the Atlantic, pillaging and colonizing whoever’s shores they come across.

CUBBY 2: Whoa.

CUBBY 1: Once they colonize a country, they force twelve carefully chosen citizens to compete in a baking contest to the death once a year. The bakers are given three challenges: a signature bake, a technical challenge, and a show-stopper. In the final round, three bakers are left and a winner is chosen from the three.

CUBBY 2: Wow.

CUBBY 1: The winner is then baked into a savory pie for Theresa May and the Windsors, as a sacrifice to their greatness and vision.

CUBBY 2: Fuck!

[ MUSIC STOPS ]

CUBBY 2: That sounds like a scary glimpse at a future we may experience in our own lifetimes.

CUBBY 1: You know what I think? I think it’s real. Maybe it’s a real TV show from the future. A warning from ourselves, telling us what might happen to us if we don’t stop and realize that sharing videos of Jon Oliver and Samantha Bee and saying “Nailed It!” doesn’t count as hashtag resistance!

CUBBY 2: All this collapse of the Western world talk is makin’ me hungy! [takes a fried pie out of his pocket and starts eating it]

CUBBY 1: What are you doing?! Don’t you understand that they want you to get fat and lazy so you can’t run when The Great British Bake Off comes? You’ll be the first to captured to bake for the Queen!

CUBBY 2: Come on, it’s just a tiny pie. Calm down.

CUBBY 1: [ Snatches the pie from CUBBY 2 and holds it in his face. ] Pardon me, if I may, but sometimes, if you will, the only person that can save us from ourselves is someone else, if you’ll excuse me for saying so. That’s a quote from The Great British Bake Off.

CUBBY 2: Fine! Come on, there are some balls over in that forest hazard.

[ They walk off. Then turn back into the golfers. ]

M: Businessmen have enemies, Danielle. Profit thieves. Whiners. Losers. People who want to take our money and use it to selfishly ward off disease. They believe things like the golf course and medicine should be accessible to anyone. They want to spoil our greens. They think they’re entitled to full natural lifespans. Women who would force us to personally pay for the birthings of their spawn and other women who want to evacuate spawn from their bodies, again at our expense! Women would do this—non-businessman women.

W: No offense taken.

M: Businessmen are guardians of God’s truth against feminism, socialism, and sodomy.

W: I’m into it.

M: Now, our company denies female employees contraceptive access as part of their health plans. Do you know why?

W: We employ over 2000 women. It would be irresponsible to allow them to take plan B every day, recreationally, because their minds have been poisoned and confused by gender-neutral bathrooms.

M: You’re ready for initiation into the next level of being a businessman: that real hardcore Republican shit. Seriously sick shit, not that soft shit Fox News shit. Raw shit, uncutshit, triple-R Republican shit. Shit even your worst uncle wouldn’t believe.

W: Hell yeah, I’m ready.

M: There’s a streaming channel I want you to subscribe to. It’s 24/7 footage of poor people being teased and tormented inside a videodrome of unspeakable horror. It costs $8000 a month and is only available on Apple products. Do you know it?

W: Know it? I was there, man. I made a transient eat my horse socks. Just because I’m a biological female doesn’t mean I don’t roll deep with this Republican shit. I’m beyond deep. I’m into shit that’ll get you banned from Reddit. I got tapes and shit.

[ She pulls out a tape. ]

M: Damn, son, where’d you find this?

W: I trade secret conspiracy tapes on the dark web. This is a hot one. The media won’t even touch shit like this. This is the real shit you won’t get from the fake media. Let’s listen.

[ SOUND: Comey tape. ]

M: My my my. The student has become the master.

W: I’ve got the president’s pee tape, too. But in context it actually makes him sound really cool and good.

[ W takes a bad swing. ]

W: Son of a damn it! I’m sorry. I shouldn’t speak so freely. I just went nuts.

M: Perhaps the time has come for you to go nuts.

W: Should I?

M: You want to be a businessman? Claim your right. Go nuts, like a golf buddy would.

W: What do I do?

M: You have many options before you. Do you violently dress down a cubby? Do you proclaim your putter a “piece of worthless shit” and break it over your knee? Do you have a furious and frustrating one-sided altercation with a shrub or tree? It is yours and yours alone to determine how you will go nuts.

W: What was your first golf meltdown like?

M: It was a magic time. I had put my ball into a water hazard for the third time that morning. I was apoplectic. I ripped the flag from the hole and used it to skewer a cubby. I relieved him of the bag he was carrying for me and used it and the clubs inside to bludgeon him. I then returned to the golf cart, a rather zippy model, and ran down my golf buddy and mentor. Then I ripped a sapling from the ground and whipped him relentlessly until the flesh peeled back from his buttocks. I still remember his groans of proud agony--proud because I had finally surpassed him. His work on this earth completed, he dissolved into a wisp of cool and location-appropriate e-vapor. All that was left on the green was his cameo. Now I wear it. It is the sign of a true businessman.

W: That’s beautiful. A fancy Victorian lady. It makes you look like a fancy Victorian lady. I want it.

M: You have not earned it! Focus your efforts on your golf course meltdown! What will you do?! How will you do it?! Where will your furies be focused? On whom?! There is no time! You must go nuts right now!

W: Shut up! Shut up! Stop screaming at me! I am strong, strong as a businessman now! Do you know what that means?! I feel the spirits of businessmen past entering my body! It means I am now filled with the unbridled and petulant rage of all businessmen before me!

M: Embrace it! Going nuts is the final stage in your ascension! Say it!

W: [ Starts swinging club around ]I’m going nuts!

M: Louder!

W: I will reach my full potential as a strong woman! I will get revenge on slash approval from the father I never knew, the one who abandoned me on the golf course, leaving me at the mercy of falcons and fickle fate!

M: Wait. Danielle?

W: Silence!

[ She stabs him with her club. ]

W: Oh no. I stabbed you with my club. That’s what just happened.

M: Remember when I said you were probably not my daughter Danielle? I think that was wrong. Now that I have some more key pieces of telling information, I think you are her.

W: Dad? Oh no. I found you and then I killed you. I’m having complicated, womb-like feelings about this!

M: No, no! No need for feelings! This is fitting. The cycle is complete. This is yours, now.

[ Gives cameo from around his neck. ]

W: This reminds me of that band Cameo. I thought that song “Word Up” was by Devo for the longest time.

M: The age of Napster. Everyone mislabeled their MP3s.

W: 1999.

M: We used to listen to “Word Up” … While we were heating the turkey legs.

[ SOUND: Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing ]

M: Danielle, listen closely. Somewhere in this course … Your mother and brother still live. It was a simple plan. I was to find a new livelihood amongst the businessmen of this modern world. I won their trust with my delicious double-fried funnel cakes, eventually moving on to more challenging bakes like Swedish rolls and choux pastries. I penetrated the inner sanctums of business and dwelt among the biggest assholes on the planet. Truly great men. I had my own reality show for 12 years, the highest honor a businessman can attain.

W: Wow. I had no idea it was on that long, or that it existed at all.

M: It was all to sustain the family in the darkness before the promised coming of the 4:45 mud show. But I lost my way. Got wrapped up in business! Business! Always business! More hands to shake! More deals!

[ W begins making “wrap it up” motions. ]

M: Find them if you can. This burden now passes to you... Mr. Vice President.

W: Wait! No! Father. You can’t die like this. You were going to comp our lunches!

[ M, during his dying groan, takes another e-cigarette drag and blows it out. ]

M: So goes my soul, into the air.

W: What a cool, great way to die.

[ Shouts. ]

W: You! Over there in the tree hazard! Caddies! I mean cabbies! I mean, cubbies! Come quick! This man’s body is probably heavy.

[ They become Caddies. ]

CUBBY 1: I’m dying! A young man bludgeoned me with a Fisher Price concertina! He was so polite and spoke in beautiful Shakespeare language, but also he was incredibly cruel! He killed me for the pastries I took from you to save you from yourself.

CUBBY 2: Oh god, it must have been a great British baker! You were right, it was one of those real movies!

CUBBY 1: Promise me something.

CUBBY 2: Yes?

CUBBY 1: Promise me you won’t let the great Brexit happen to us! Promise you won’t let the British bake you into a pie! Write a think piece! Open your eyes and write a think piece, record a podcast, start a Patreon … it’s the only thing that works anymore!

CUBBY 2: I swear to you as your fellow caddy and brother in blood, I will write a think piece for all to read and share. I will write it with my own blood. The keyboard will be sticky with my blood and I will take it to the Genius Bar and I will deny knowing what happened to it and then I will do it again. I will open my eyes.

[ They hold hands. CUBBY 2 closes her eyes and CUBBY 1 opens his. ]

CUBBY 1: Is it beautiful? Looking at the world with your eyes open?

CUBBY 2: It’s beautiful. Nailed it.

[ Dies with a puff of vape. ]

[ They become Ren Fair people. ]

SON: Mother! Your pains of hunger end now! I have slain one of the foreign ballmen and seized his tiny pies!

MOTHER: It is too late, my son, I am dying. Whatever your father sent today … It was underbaked. Bad structure. None of the flavors came through. Just a shame, a real shame. So bad I’m actually dying now. Ah, how I wish I could have made it a little longer. I would have liked to see the 4:45 mud show.

SON: Mother, please. You can’t leave me. Father hasn’t returned. I’ll be lost.

MOTHER: When the 4:45 Mud Show begins, my son, he will return. You will recognize him by the cameo that he wears upon his neck, my son.

SON: We used to listen to “Word Up” as we heated up the turkey legs….

MOTHER: The best song.

[ She dies with a puff of vape. ]

[ Son cries. Courtney changes back into businesswoman. Their eyes meet in the middle of the stage. Curtis sees the cameo. ]

W: You’re probably my lost brother.

SON: You’re probably my father!

W: Well….

[ Suddenly, a pastry protrudes through the son. ]

[ MUSIC STOPS ]

SON: Oh god! Someone skewered me from behind with a cinnamon twist. That’s what just happened.

W: Noooooooo, my brother! You were probably so interesting. I don’t really remember you.

SON: Who did this to meeeeee?

[ Spins around to become Cubby. ]

CUBBY 2: I did this! I’m hopped up on pastry-based vengeance against the ruling class! I won’t let your big money and your Shakespeare talk turn this beautiful nation into a bunch of British bullshit!

W: Get back in your place, Cubby! I know British martial arts!

[ They throw pastries at each other out of a big stupid bucket. ]

W: Oh no! Dead.

CUBBY 2: Now to ransack your corpse.

[ He takes the cameo. ]

CUBBY 2: Good god. This looks like a beautiful Victorian lady … a Queen. The queen. Theresa May. The Great Brexit. My God! THIS SERIES OF IRONIC TWISTS, TURNS, AND COINCIDENCES HAS BROUGHT THE PROPHECY TO PASS IN A SATISFYING ENDING THAT EVERYONE HAS ENJOYED!

[ LIGHTS OUT ]

[ SOUND: Word Up ]


[ LIGHTS UP ]

[ CUE: 1. put your hands ]

V/O: Ladies and gentlemen: Put your hands together for the Beach Boys!

CURTIS: Hello, music lovers!

COURTNEY: Hi!

CURTIS: My name is Dan Wallace.

COURTNEY: I’m Cassidy Wallace.

CURTIS: We’ve been happily married for 20 years.

[ He claps, inciting the audience to do so, then gives up. ]

COURTNEY: And partners selling affordable commercial real estate for just that long.

CURTIS: We do everything together!

COURTNEY: And we’re The Beach Boys.

CURTIS: That’s right. Now, I must say, and this isn’t a huge surprise: There are some disappointed faces in the crowd.

COURTNEY: Some angry faces, too. And lots of confused ones.

CURTIS: And you know what? Fair enough. God knows, if I bought a ticket to see “The Beach Boys” at a performance venue, I would expect some music.

COURTNEY: Those sun-dappled shoobie doo-wops about cars, girls, and good times. Or the sweet spooky sound of a ghost crying on “Good Vibrations”.

[ They both make the theremin sound and spook themselves. ]

COURTNEY: Fun fact: A real ghost was murdered in the studio to get that sound.

CURTIS: Anyhow, I sure as heck wouldn’t expect an old married couple of real estate agents runnin’ their yapholes.

COURTNEY: But the fact is, folks...we are The Beach Boys.

CURTIS: Last year, my wife Cassidy and I purchased the rights to tour and perform using the name “The Beach Boys”.

COURTNEY: Via some nice folks representing the business interests of Mr. Al Jardine.

CURTIS: Of The Beach Boys.

COURTNEY: Lead vocalist on “Help Me, Rhonda”. Rhythm guitar on … other tracks. Fun fact: Al Jardine is 5’5” and currently alive.

CURTIS: So, while your disappointment and dismay are justified--

COURTNEY: After all, tickets were 50 to 200 dollars.

CURTIS: --I assure you that this is perfectly legal.

COURTNEY: And that’s what matters. We’re The Beach Boys!

CURTIS: We’re commercial real estate agents and we’ve been married for 20 years!

COURTNEY: And once the sting subsides, we hope you’ll stick around to hear about some great strip mall properties for local businesses or retail franchises.

CURTIS: Now, some of you are leaving the venue. Others are cursing or throwing things at us.

COURTNEY: Believe us, we get it. If we were in your shoes, we’d be pretty--pardon my French--damn furious about our money and time.

CURTIS: I remember Cassidy’s face when we went to that Journey concert on our anniversary…

COURTNEY: Steve Perry’s not the singer anymore! It’s this Filipino guy!

CURTIS: Beautiful voice!

COURTNEY: But not Steve Perry. Not what I thought I was paying for.

CURTIS: And you better believe we started cursing and throwing things. I threw the $30 Journey coozie I just bought at Neil Schon.

COURTNEY: The coozie didn’t make it past the bald guy in front of us, but I think we made our point. Just so you know where this is headed: Refunds are not and will not be available.

CURTIS: Some folks, at this point in the presentation, due to the conciliatory tone of that anecdote about Journey, start asking if we might refund tickets bought under “false premises.”

COURTNEY: But the premises aren’t false. We’re The Beach Boys! In the eyes of the law, which is all that matters in civil society.

CURTIS: Now, at this point, anyone who hasn’t already left usually starts cursing a little louder and throwing things a little harder.

COURTNEY: And this crowd isn’t letting us down. We absolutely understand!

CURTIS: So let’s get to the important part.

COURTNEY: Did you know that, even in this booming local economy, you can find a great business location at a fair price?

CURTIS: That’s because of the longer cycles to turn over units in strip mall developments.

COURTNEY: I know what you’re thinking. Probably, “Let’s throw stuff at these assholes who tricked us and wasted our time.” But if you’re listening, you may also be thinking, “Strip malls? UGH!”

CURTIS: Hold on. Strip malls aren’t just fuddy duddy payday loan shops and disgusting tattoo parlors and Cici’s Pizza anymore.

COURTNEY: The business community is revitalizing the concept of the strip mall in the artisanal present.

CURTIS: You could open a theater! A pop-up juice bar! A vape shop for dogs!

COURTNEY: There’s still quite a bit of throwing going on. We get it, but you’ve made your point, guys. We are The Beach Boys--the legal entity known as The Beach Boys. Either pay attention to the presentation or get on with your evening.

CURTIS: OK, there’s still a lot of throwing. So tell you what: Let’s make a game of it. If you knock me or Cassidy out, you implicitly agree to tour one of the properties we have available.

COURTNEY: It’s like a living carnival game! Knock us out!

CURTIS: We’ll hold you to it! Knock-knock us out.

COURTNEY: Knock-knock us out!

TOGETHER: [ chanting ] Knock-knock us out! Knock-knock us out! Knock-knock!

COURTNEY: Someone’s at the door!

[ Curtis destroys the door. ]

CURTIS: Huh. Nobody’s there.

[ Curtis replaces the door. ]

COURTNEY: I would have sworn someone was there. I swore I heard “knock-knock”.

TOGETHER: Someone’s at the door!

[ Courtney destroys the door. ]

COURTNEY: How weird.
 CURTIS: [ knowing ] I think someone’s playing a prank on us….

COURTNEY: Oh! That sounds new and fun.

CURTIS: Get ready to meet our new neighbor.

COURTNEY: I’m ready.

CURTIS: Hell no you aren’t….

[ Curtis steps out and returns with the pterodactyl puppet. ]

[ CUE: 2. crowd goes nuts ]

FRED: It’s me! Fred the Pterodactyl!

COURTNEY: Hot damn! This guy looks like unexpectedly adult-oriented trouble.

CURTIS: Things are about to get fucking outrageous in here.

COURTNEY: Fred, I’m bored. I’ve been reading a Cosmo article about oral sex tricks that guys love. Got anything to say about that?

FRED: Magazines are too intense for me. I like the weekly Best Buy circular. You got any juice?

CURTIS: You mean beer, right Fred? A real “guy’s” beer? Coors?

FRED: No. Juice, please.

COURTNEY: That’s crazy. He likes juice.

CURTIS: Is that crazy?

COURTNEY: How else is he gonna turn our world upside down?

FRED: A snack, too.

COURTNEY: How about some real “bro” food? Hot wings?

FRED: Crackers or trail mix, please.

COURTNEY: I got it!

[ She runs to get the props and replaces the door as she does so. ]

CURTIS: So, Fred, what’s the outrageous reason for a talking pterodactyl living in the 21st century in an apartment?

FRED: Not much. I work from home. Tech support. I watch TV.
Have you watched House of Cards?

CURTIS: No.

FRED: Not good.

[ Courtney returns with juice and snacks. ]

FRED: Thanks!

[ He starts snacking. ]

COURTNEY: Thanks what? Aren’t you going to call me some horny sexist garbage? “Thanks, sweet tits?” “Thanks, honey ass?”

FRED: Jesus, no. Of course not.

COURTNEY: [ to Curtis ] He’s playing coy, but he had a foul mouth when I left the room, right? When I left, he was like, “Man, I wanna UUUNH with that chick’s UUUNH.”

CURTIS: Not really.

COURTNEY: He smoked some bong and then he was like, “Get me that beer, dude!” Big fart!

CURTIS: No.

FRED: Oh no. These Ritzes are awfully salty.

COURTNEY: Fred’s turning our lives upside down!!

FRED: You guys should come to my hamburger party this Friday.

COURTNEY: Fred!!!!

FRED: We all bring a different hamburger to share. Then we quietly fill out a standardized form to compare their quality. It’s five pages. We play some light music while we’re filling out the forms, but nothing loud or distracting. No rock and roll. No rap. No electronic music. No R&B. No hot jazz. No cool jazz. No classical. No calypso. No world music, not of any kind, no sir. No film soundtracks. No spoken word. No sound effects.

COURTNEY: Then what happens? Burping? Prostitutes?

FRED: We debate until we reach a consensus about the best hamburger, and then we blog about it. Quietly. Then we drink a Diet Pepsi to celebrate. It’s a party!

COURTNEY: Every day’s a fucked-up filthy adventure with Fred!

CURTIS: Hold it. This puppet was supposed to change things.

COURTNEY: He’s changing everything right now. Everything’s wackier.

FRED: I need to use the bathroom!

[ Courtney laughs uncontrollably. ]

COURTNEY: See? “Outta the way, molasses twat. This dino’s gotta drop a few meteors!”

CURTIS: That’s not what he said. He’s boring.

COURTNEY: He’s a pterodactyl!

CURTIS: He’s a drip. A total ding-dong.

COURTNEY: Someone’s at the door!

[ Courtney destroys the door. ]

CURTIS: Who is it?

COURTNEY: One second.

[ Courtney puts on a police hat, runs to the other side of the door ]

COP: Excuse me, is there a Fred Pterodactyl in this apartment?

FRED: Oh no! They found me!

CURTIS: He’s in trouble?

FRED: I’ll go quietly, but I wanna speak to my attorney!!

COP: Mr. Pterodactyl, you are under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Should you choose to waive that right--

[ During this, cop tries to take Fred off of Curtis’s hand, but Curtis resists. She tries to arrest Curtis instead. Curtis resists. Cop settles on holding Fred’s “arms” behind his back. ]

CURTIS: What’s the charge?

COP: Mail fraud.

COURTNEY: Outrageous!

COP: It’s an old scam. You send letters to retirement homes, saying you’re from the shopping network and that the recipient missed payment on their order. You set up a dummy PayPal account. When they write back...

CURTIS: Oh, Jesus, boring!

FRED: Boring? You know how many stamps I had to lick?

CURTIS: Stamps are self-adhesive. You don’t have to lick them.

FRED: Whoooo-oooo-oooops!

[ Courtney starts laughing. ]

FRED: Sometimes I shoplift ground beef!

CURTIS: Who gives a fuck?

COP: Come along, sir.

[ Cop tosses Fred puppet through the door. ]

CURTIS: I love this straight-laced cop, though.

COURTNEY: Really?

CURTIS: Yeah. Deadpan.

COURTNEY: I wish he’d do something weird. Like make a sexual advance. Or reveal his hilariously troubled inner life.

COP: Have a nice evening, sir.

CURTIS: Love it! Subtle.

COURTNEY: Snooze.

COP: Maybe you should meet my partner.

[ Cop reveals a cop puppet. ]

[ CUE: 2. crowd goes nuts ]

COP PUPPET: Greetings, citizens. Once I shoved a peppermint Yankee Candle up a suspect’s asshole. That’s a little trick I learned from mother.

COP: You unprofessional piece of shit.

COURTNEY: Now we’re talking.

CURTIS: That’s the worst thing I’ve ever heard.

COP PUPPET: Don’t knock it till you’ve tried it!

CURTIS: Huh?

COP PUPPET: Don’t knock-knock till you--

CURTIS: What? Excuse me?

COP PUPPET: Knock-knock!

CURTIS: Someone’s at the ... Hold on.

[ Curtis replaces the door. ]

TOGETHER: Door!

[ Courtney destroys the door while Curtis goes around to put on Coco mask. ]

COURTNEY: Look everyone, it’s Coco the sketch gorilla! She’s an orphaned sketch gorilla. We found her in the jungle, abandoned and alone because we shot her mother! Curtis and I are wildlife enthusiasts. Curtis, look it’s….I wonder where he went? Coco’s species is gorilla magilla, which has a primal instinct for “skit” comedy. In the wild, gorilla magilla troops or “troupes” amuse themselves by playacting job interviews, blind dates, and game shows using fruit peels and bits of bark as props.

[ COCO signs wildly and hands her a script. ]

COURTNEY: Coco has written us a new script!

[ COURTNEY reads over the script. ]

COURTNEY: Coco, we agreed no more kitten sketches.

[ Coco signs wildly. ]

COURTNEY: During our last writing session, remember? You had a kitten monologue and two kitten sketches and we said “no more kitten sketches, Coco.”

[ COCO signs. ]

COURTNEY: She says “Coco write what Coco know.” Also, we had to cut the kitten monologue. Sorry, Coco.

[ COCO starts to lose it. Signs to COURTNEY. ]

COURTNEY: [ laughs ] She says “Coco off-book already.”

[ COCO signs. Courtney laughs. ]

COURTNEY: She says “you are never fully off-book for shows.” Coco, that’s because I don’t have to be! I’m charming, and when I mess up, everyone loves it!

[ COCO signs. ]

COURTNEY: She says “Coco hate sketchprov. It’s the worst of both worlds. You lose the spontaneity of improv and you also lose the precision of a well-rehearsed show.” Coco, don’t be mean.

[ Coco starts freaking out. ]

COURTNEY: She’s saying “Coco have button! Coco have button! You never end sketches! You just segue into the next sketch!”

[ Coco signs. ]

COURTNEY: Coco wants a button? I think she wants a button. I have a nice shiny RED button right here! Coco!!!

[ Coco runs over and grabs the button and runs off. Curtis takes off mask and replaces door. ]

COURTNEY: Stupid fucking gorilla.

[ CURTIS smashes through door. ]

COURTNEY: Hey Curtis.

CURTIS: Hey.

COURTNEY: Coco was just here.

CURTIS: I hate that fucking gorilla. Boo!

BOTH: [ very afraid ] Aaahhh!!! A g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-ghost!

COURTNEY: Man, that ghost sounded familiar.

CURTIS: Was it your wealthy uncle that we murdered?

COURTNEY: No, not like that. Like, you know….

[ She starts snapping. ]

CURTIS: Was it the “Good Vibrations” ghost?

COURTNEY: No, no. An actor. God, you know him. It sounded like ….

[ She starts snapping. ]

COURTNEY: You know….

CURTIS: Oh, wait, yeah, I know, you mean ….

[ He starts snapping. ]

CURTIS: I loved him in….

COURTNEY: No, not him….

[ They milk this for a bit. ]

CURTIS: Oh yeah! YEAH! I always liked that guy. What ever happened to great character actors like that?

COURTNEY: Don’t you know? Character actors are being driven from their motion picture homelands in alarming numbers.

CURTIS: It’s so sad. I immediately think we’ve got to do something. What our generation does best: start a petition.

COURTNEY: Let’s go door to door!

[ They pick up a door and smash it together. ]

CURTIS: Sir, a moment of your time to learn about character actors?

COURTNEY: We’re out educating people about character actors: what they are, what function they serve in society, how they impact our daily lives.

CURTIS: We know what you’re saying: “I’m not sure I understand … character actors? I’ve never heard of a character actor.”

COURTNEY: Chances are, you’ve seen a character actor and never knew it!

CURTIS: The OED defines a character actor as “an actor who works on character parts”.

COURTNEY: Character actors are the brave souls called on to play “effeminate, easily scared male librarian” or “germaphobic office worker with a constant case of sinusitis”.

CURTIS: Sometimes they’re “pushy guitar salesman” or “woman startled by hat.”

COURTNEY: Sometimes they’re “dumbass on rollerblades” or “trumpet player.” Or “boss”. Or “doctor”. Or “Dr. Dave.”

CURTIS: Or sometimes, just Dave. Or Phyllis, or Paul, or Sanjay. Yes. The characters a leading man or woman can’t handle are the kind of characters character actors were BORN to play.

COURTNEY: Character Actors are the only actors with the courage to be covered in pea soup acting as vomit.

CURTIS: Character Actors are the only people with the moral fortitude to be unceremoniously killed in every movie they appear in.

COURTNEY: But they’re not just a statistic, or a concept.

CURTIS: No, character actors are real people with names. Stephen Tobolowsky, Reginald VelJohnson, Siobhan Hogan.

COURTNEY: Dan Wallaby has been in every John Carpenter, James Cameron and Tim Burton movie, just by chance, and played “police officer who has unfortunate accident” in every one.

CURTIS: Marla Dingo has played a nurse in over 400 television pilots, none of which have ever made it past the testing stage. She also played a nurse in a student short last year.

COURTNEY: Stella Gordon has quite literally played grandmother to every actor in the Screen Actor’s Guild, including several that are technically older than her.

CURTIS: In the biz, they call that a “Wilford Brimley.”

COURTNEY: Now, I know what you’re thinking. “I still don’t really understand what a character actor is. Does every character actor have a few lines in every movie?” No.

CURTIS: This is a common misconception. But it brings us to the real issue today. Movie hollywood directors are actually not required to use ANY character actors in their movies AT ALL!

COURTNEY: Wait a minute, Curtis, are you telling me that a Steven Spielberg or a Michael Bay could make an ENTIRE movie without any character actors in it AT ALL?

CURTIS: If they chose to do it, no law could stop them, Courtney, and that’s why we need you to help us make the “Character Actor Act” a reality.

COURTNEY: The “Character Actor Act” would require that any Hollywood movie feature at least 20% character actors saying at least 10% of the lines.

CURTIS: An ensemble film such as “Love, Actually” or anything by Wes Anderson would be required to feature 50% character actors saying at least 75% of the lines.

COURTNEY: These are tough times for Hollywood. International competition, cheap at-home video streaming options, outmoded distribution systems, Neko Atsume … some big-money Hollywood studios are talking about saving dollars by eliminating character actors.

CURTIS: Did you know that some experts predict that by 2018, 20% of Hollywood movies will be Tom Hiddleston delivering a monologue while sitting on a bar stool? An additional 15% will be movies about Emma Stone stranded in an abandoned bus depot, totally alone.

COURTNEY: Another 7% will be BB-8 movies!

CURTIS: These are terrifying times, people, times when all of this that we have described could become a reality. When the cast of Ocean’s 14 could be ALL A-list actors. I mean, what REALLY DID happen to Bernie Mac? And before you tell me he was a star, I will tell you that THAT WAS MOSTLY ON TV.

COURTNEY: If Character Actors are driven from their home in the backgrounds of movies, they’ll have nowhere to turn but your home town.

CURTIS: That’s right, they’ll arrive at your front door in flimsy rafts with their entire families and their most prized possessions, asking for refuge.

COURTNEY: No one wants character actors wandering our streets, sleeping under our bridges, adding a little color to our American towns but not drawing too much focus.

CURTIS: In our bathrooms.

[ At about this point, Courtney starts using her glasses for more and more physical business. ]

COURTNEY: Peeing in our bathrooms. Pooping in our bathrooms. This is why we must support the Character Actor Act.

CURTIS: I know what you’re thinking: Can’t they just write books? Some of them may.

COURTNEY: No law prohibits them, thankfully.

CURTIS: Some might do podcasts. Does every character actor have a podcast? Yes. Is every podcast done by a character actor? Unfortunately, no.

COURTNEY: Should you follow a character actor on Twitter? Always. They know where to find the best kitty cat pictures. And if David O. Russell has a meltdown on the set, they’ll live tweet the whole thing.

CURTIS: And though writing books, doing podcasts and updating Twitter are all very lucrative pursuits, none of these are the Character Actor’s natural craft.

COURTNEY: After all, how can I bask in the glow of Steve Buscemi’s teeth through a book, podcast or through Twitter?

CURTIS: We must save the character actor. It is our duty as moviegoing Americans.

COURTNEY: Sign this petition today!

[ Courtney takes her glasses off, scratches temple with them, points at clipboard with them, fumbles with them, puts them back on. ]

CURTIS: Wait a minute. What’s with all the subtle physical business?

COURTNEY: I don’t know what you’re talking about.

CURTIS: What’s with those glasses?

COURTNEY: Nothing.

CURTIS: You’re one of them, aren’t you?

COURTNEY: I’m not! I’m not!

CURTIS: I bet you have a catchphrase.

COURTNEY: I don’t!

CURTIS: You do, I can tell.

COURTNEY: No!! No I don’t!

CURTIS: What’s your catchphrase?

COURTNEY: I’ve got some room-room in my womb-womb for some boom-boom.

BOTH: Aaaahhh!!! Someone’s shooting at us!

CURTIS: Hide!!

[ CURTIS hides behind a door. ]

COURTNEY: Let me in! Let us in! I’m scared! You’re scared!

[ CURTIS bursts through door. ]

MAN: May I help you?

SALESWOMAN: Hello, sir. You’re interested in a magazine subscription. Why not support a good cause while you’re at it?

MAN: Excuse me?

SALESWOMAN: As you know, sir, I’m selling magazine subscriptions. There are dozens of magazines to choose from. As you know, your subscription will help support Americans suffering from Hyperempathic Identification Disorder, or HID. Americans like you and me, sir, as you know.

MAN: I’m confused.

SALESWOMAN: Take your time, sir. You’re in no hurry.

MAN: I’m don’t understand what you’re talking about.

SALESWOMAN: Of course you do. I’m selling magazine subscriptions--

MAN: I get that.

SALESWOMAN: There are so many to choose from. There’s Cook’s Illustrated. You want to cook more. There’s Travel. You can read about Belize, which you’ve wanted to visit since you were a little girl.

MAN: I think you have me confused with someone else.

SALESWOMAN: As you know, Hyperempathic Identification Disorder affects dozens of Americans every century. Sufferers of HID, like yourself, have trouble functioning in normal society. Even the smallest interaction can be difficult to someone with HID. Someone like you.

MAN: I don’t have HID. At least I’m pretty sure I don’t, because I’ve never heard of it.

SALESWOMAN: You can also buy a gift subscription. Father’s Day is around the corner. Your dad spends hours in the garage with his figurines. Why not get him a subscription to Civil War Miniaturist? Only $49.99 a year, a modest markup from the shelf price.

MAN: My father’s dead.

SALESWOMAN: That’s not correct. But you could also treat yourself. How about Puzzle Enthusiast? A nice Sudoku always relieves your despair over your terrible, tragic condition.

MAN: Are you all right?

SALESWOMAN: Of course not. You suffer from HID.

MAN: What is HID?

SALESWOMAN: Hyperempathic Identification Disorder, as you know, sir, is the mental inability to distinguish yourself from others. And vice versa. You’ve struggled with it all your life. It makes it difficult for you to relate to other people.

[ Pause. ]

MAN: What the fuck is happening here?

SALESWOMAN: Sir, I have some nerve using that language when you’re standing outside of my house trying to sell you magazines.

MAN: Hey, you know what? Fuck you!

SALESWOMAN: Fuck you? Fuck me!

MAN: That’s right, fuck you!

SALESWOMAN: I’m such a fucking asshole! You’re just trying to help a worthy cause! Get out of my house!

[ COURTNEY puts a door up in front of her. They struggle over it. CURTIS exits angry and confused. COCO returns, takes the door and breaks it over her knee. ]

COURTNEY: Oh no! Our gorilla’s going ape! I mean grape! I mean ape!

[ Coco grabs her head. ]

COURTNEY: What’s that, Coco? You’ll crush my skull with your strong gorilla hands if you can’t do the kitten monologue?

[ Coco responds. ]

COURTNEY: [ nervous ] Coco! It looks like we’ve got a little extra time if you wanna do that kitty cat monologue.

[ CUE: 3 Clint Eastwood ]

[ Coco does his monologue, a combination of “ook ook” and pantomime. ]

COURTNEY: Well Coco, that’s a weird way to end a comedy show. You sure you don’t have a nice callback for the audience?

[ Coco pulls out a bag of red buttons and tosses them into the audience. ]

COURTNEY: Now we’re talking!

[ LIGHTS DOWN ]

[ CUE: 4 Mister Jung Stuffed ]

PART 1

CURTIS
Folks, tonight’s about sketch comedy. The props, wigs, and outrageous characters that bring a little light to our lives. But, honestly, hosting this show is a little awkward for us …

COURTNEY
We’ve moved beyond sketch comedy. It’s a childish bauble for childish brains.

CURTIS
Well, I don’t know that I’d go that far.

COURTNEY
I would.

BRADEN
Nowadays, Your Terrific Neighbors are more invested in preserving regional folk cultures and storytelling traditions. Like the late, great Pete Seeger, a personal hero of mine, who introduced me to “Froggy Went a-Courtin’”, which is the only song worth hearing.

CURTIS
So, instead of comedy, we’re presenting a tale as old as Texas, and nearly as tall!

COURTNEY
It’s a tale of sheriffs and ladies, of chivalry and ancient showdown curses. A tale of golden fleeces, babies made of caramel, and the deep friendship between a man and his trusty steed.

BRADEN
We might not get to all that stuff, honestly.

CURTIS
Join us, friends, as we set the time machine for centuries ago, and set the place machine for the dry plains of west Texas, as we journey down to Castle Gulch.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ CELTIC MUSIC ]

[ LIGHTS UP. Arthur, Merlyn, and Guinever are sitting around a fire. ]

ARTHUR (V/O)
There’s me, that’s Sheriff Arthur Hood, king of Castle Gulch and also it’s most notorious outlaw. There’s Merlyn, my trusty old hand. Some thought old Merlyn had gone idjit long past, datin’ from the time he spent a week in the blazing desert eatin’ from Injun dream bushes, whose berries, they say, give a man visions of ancient spirits who roam these parts. But hell, Merlyn been with me a long time, and was a good hand with a magick spell. Finally, there was the lady Maid Guinevere, who run the whorehouse in Castle Gulch, and came to us from the frosty norths, where them giants dwell, with fancy ideas about civilization. One time she done tried to make me read a book, but I ain’t lettered and don’t intend to be. I was in love with the lady Maid Guinevere, but feared to tell her, being but a humble king and notorious outlaw, and not worthy of the attention’s of such a fine and gracious lady.

GUINEVERE
Don’t that ol’ sun-god look lonesome, bearin’ down on the horizon like that, to its resting bed in the sleeping pits of the titans.

ARTHUR
Speak no poetry to me, Lady Maid Guinevere--it falls dead on my dumb old ears.

[ Merlyn laughs wheezily. ]

GUINEVERE
I figured we’d find some respite from our troubles in the realm of figurative language. I went to a school for fine ladies, where I studied tongue-speaking.

ARTHUR
No time for respite. Them Saxons is out there, on the great plain, singin’ their songs to the big old Spirit.

GUINEVERE
It’s a fine thing to pretend.

ARTHUR
Ain’t much cotton to pretendin’ myself. It’s the work of fairy folk, and we’s beings of flesh.

MERLYN
Hell, I ain’t! Don’t you never forget that the waters of Avalon county run through my veins, and my sinews are made of pork and beans! Hee hee! Nellie whoops, funnel cakes and kettle corns, hee hee!

ARTHUR
Talk sense, Merlyn.

MERLYN
Mead and turkeys and dragon’s breath, I speaks in riddles all the time!

GUINEVERE
Old fool.

ARTHUR
Merlyn’s still got one or two wits left in his ol’ cotton sack.

[ Merlyn starts whinnying. ]

ARTHUR
Look now, you got him all worked up. He’s goin’ into his horse mode.

GUINEVERE
Bless me! I meant no harm to the old fellow.

ARTHUR
Give him one-a these, and you’ll be fast friends ag’in.

[ Hands her a sugar cube, which she puts in Merlyn’s mouth. ] 
MERLYN
If only these old bones-a mine could rest!

GUINEVERE
I feared that you’d go true horse on us, old Merlyn, and we’d be pressed to eat you as we did the other horses.

MERLYN
I told you both that eatin’ our only horses would bring us to no good. It’s a wise man that leaves hisself two horses and woos ‘em to t’each other.

ARTHUR
Groan! My empty belly’s more tangled than a washtub of hydra heads.

MERLYN
I been eatin’ dirt and bugs, so ain’t no change for me. I’s a wild man of the wood, and I worship three rocks what stand on each other, ho ho, hee hee!

GUINEVERE
A fancy lady never admits to the hungers that plague her. I’ll have the salad please. Serving boy? Serving boy?

[ Talking to her hand. ]

GUINEVERE
What a fine little serving boy. His hair shines like mermaid’s gold.

ARTHUR
Merlyn, use the sight what the devil gave you to spy us out some food.

MERLYN
Well, let me toss some scrying dust on this there here that fire, and we can all stare at, see if we see somethin’ or t’other.

[ Transitions into an intro for the next troupe. ]



PART 2

[ CHANT MUSIC ]

GWYNEVERE
Howdy, I’m Gwynevere, marm and madam to ole Castle Gulch. While we’re all still starving on the dusty plain--good a time as any, I figure, for a lady to get some reminiscing done. When I moved to this god forsaken ditch of a town it was backwardser than a hastily put on tshirt...or just shirt...after a secret rendevous in the bathroom of a…...

Anyhow, I was sent here to bring a little culture to Castle Gulchians. Now who would give a whit whether the citzens of Castle Gulch were educated or none?

Well the elders of the mysterious island on which I was reared, a lady-centric counter-narrative that can only be seen when the mists are heavy on the moors, had read somethin of a prophecy in the stirrin leaves:

[Enter ELDER 1 and ELDER 2. GWYNEVERE appears to pray or meditate or whatever. The ELDERS join her on either side.]

ALL
Oh isle of ladies, mists of the fairer sex, we wend your magic and brush our hair. We sing the songs we learned at Girl Scout Camp:

Rose, rose, rose, red,
Shall I ever see thee wed?
I will marry at thy will,
sire at thy will.

So say we all. Now for the exchanging of the friendship bracelets.

ELDER 1
Gwenyfarrrrrrrrrrr.

ELDER 2 [joining in]
Gwenyfarrrrrrrrr.

ELDER 1 [continuing]
arrrrrrrrr

ELDER 2 [continuing]
arrrrrrrr

[ELDER 1 ends the song like a conductor]

GWYNEVERE [sounding more sophisticated and normal than Castle Gulch Gwynevere]
Yes my wise elders.

ELDER 1
You have been with us since we found you as an infant half-drowned in a bog. We raised you in the image of the goddess, schooled you in the arts of femininity, wiliness and frilly things. We reared you for a mission, Gwynheefffffarrrrr.

ELDER 2 [joining]
Gwynefarrrrrrr

ELDER 1 [continuing]
Arrrrrrrrr

ELDER 2 [trying to harmonize.
Arrrrrrr. [beat] Your life’s work has come to pass, Gwnheyyefarrrr. [looks to ELDER 1 who shakes her head “no”] The prophecy we have seen is upon us.

ELDER 1
This is what we have prepared you for Gwynhefarrrrrr.

ELDER 2
Gwynhefarrrrrr.

ELDER 1
arrrrrrrr

ELDER 2
arrrrrrr

[The elders fade away while they say “arrrrrrr”]

[ FADE OUT CHANT MUSIC ]

GWYNEVERE [back to Castle Gulch accent}
They sent me from the magical feminist narrative in which I had been raised and schooled find the man in Castle Gulch was to go on to rule all of Avalon County. I was to culture, woo and bear bairn to the chosen one.

[GWYNEVERE opens a parisol and takes out a hanky and looks lost and disgusted. ARTHUR and MERLIN saunter slowly towards GWYNEVERE. MERLIN is eating a turkey leg. Sounds of an old west town?]

ARTHUR [to MERLIN but for GWYNEVERE to here]
Seems we got another ona them fancy types looks to teachin us manners and proper book useage.

[MERLIN throws the turkey leg on the ground, takes a book from his cloak, wipes his face with it and throws it over his shoulder]

MERLIN
T’aint never worked before t’aint gonna work this time.

[they reach GWYNEVERE]

ARTHUR
Got damn fancy wench with high ideas from the frozen north, shrouded in tobaccy smoke, here to peddle fancy feminist steampunk ideas, I’ll run her through like we did all them other ladies and preachers and such.

[GWYNEVERE turns around and ARTHUR is obviously love struck. ARTHUR removes his hat and worries at it with his hands]

ARTHUR
Beg pardon, miss, I’m Arthur, Sherrif and King a Castle Gulch here as well as its most notorious outlaw. This here’s Merlin, our local crotchety prospector and horse-man.

[MERLIN whinnies]

ARTHUR
How may we be of assistance to such a bewitching and sophisticated stranger in our little town?

GWYNEVERE
I’m here for work purposes, inquiring to all the towns in this area as to their needs in as far as educating their young.

ARTHUR
Well, ma’am, been over 20 years since our last school marm left. The marm challenged the local chaplain to a duel during a mighty heated poker game and he had no choice but to shoot her. After several years unoccupied the school house got blowt over in a terrible wind storm.

MERLIN
I remember that storm, it blew one of my metal patio chairs over.

GWYNEVERE
So you have no school house?

ARTHUR
Not in so much as havin a school house regular, ma’am, but we have other buildins school could be done in.

MERLIN
The Misses of Avalon aint been occupied for at least a decade, I reckon.

ARTHUR
Our brothel shut down after the madam fell ill to consumption during a heated poker game and the chaplain had no choice but to shoot her.

GWYNEVERE
You boys are in luck. I happen to be specially schooled in both the sex working and teaching arts.

MERLIN [pulling Arthur aside]
Sex working?! Arthur, I ain’t one to question your wisdom but this kinda high falutin downtown talk aint gonna go down well here with folk in Castle Gulch.

ARTHUR
You know I’m not one to superstition but I got a ticklin in my bones tells me this lady here has been sent by some higher power to culture, woo and bear bairn to me!

MERLIN
I looked inta the twigs of fortune just last night and didn’t see nothin bout this.

GWYNEVERE [back into her narrating accent]
So I set to schoolin and whorin in the towna Castle Gulch. Some days I was teachin chirruns their ABCs and 123s and some days I’m teachin a young man bout to go on a long cattle drive bout the birds and the bees. I’ve become a sorta part a the town now and have developed a confusing friend-type relationship with Arthur so I kinda fucked up there…But this is all great material for my one-woman show which I’m putting on at The Pendragon on May 6th at 8:30pm, May 7th at 10pm and a Matinee May 8th at…

[during this ARTHUR and MERLIN sit down as if at a campfire and MERLIN is throwing the twigs of fortune over and over again.]

MERLIN
Stop pimping your show, don’t no one care bout your journey ta’ find yaself.

GWYNEVERE
If anyone wants to volunteer to run box office for my show, see me in the lobby and I can hook you up with some comps.

[ Introduce next troupe. ]
PART 3

A
Well, I’m still starvin’ ta death. Might as well take our minds offa it. Maybe you two can fix up a word dinner to take my mind offa this stomach trouble.

[ While M and G are speaking, A sneaks behind them and steals stuff of them. ]

M
We shoulda wooed them horses, I tell ya!

A
You don’t know nothin’ about wooin’ a horse, horse-man. Much less one t’t’a’t’other.

G
In my finishing school for fine ladies, I studied poetry. The words of the prairie bards. We were taught much of the art of wooing.

M
It’s a danged elflickin’ fool that woos with words in Castle Gulch, when he’s got enchantments to do half the work for ‘im. I fashioned me a wife from weeds and berries, prettied her up with some fancy Oriental powders what I obtained from a travelin’ djinn. We was married two years afore she was scattered to the winds.

G
I was engaged to be wed to Ugberf, The Earl of Saltybrush. He was tall as two trees stacked one on the other, and had the handsomest mustaches in Christendom. He smelled like roasted turkey on the bone and spoke only in snorts and the foulest profanities. I gave my heart to him, but he was cut down trying to steal a whole mess of holy grails from a dragon train.

[ A has returned to his seat. ]

M
Wooin’ memories.

G
Memories of wooin’ and gettin’ wooed.

[ They sigh, then notice that something is wrong. Their stuff is missing. ]

M
My gold!

G
My gold!

A
My gold! Someone took my gold, too! We been silently struck by an outlaw! No doubt some notorious outlaw, a lordly brigand of the plains. It could be none other than myself, Sheriff King Arthur Hood the outlaw. Who shall join my round posse to bring me to the justice which I require?

G
You’re talking no sense, Arthur. A demon fever’s got your four humors all mixed up. You’re talking phlegm talk when it ought to be yellow bile spurtin’ from your mouth.

A
Will no one stand by my side, sword in holster, to bring justice to these lawless pagan lands? Shall yetis and golems forever rule the wastes of Texas? Raise one hand, all ye brave men, who for justice’s sake come to the side of their sheriff king in pursuit of their outlaw king!

[ Keeps yelling. ]

[ MERLIN VOICE OVER ]

M [ v/o ]
Well, s’pose as you could magic with a “k” up a solution to this here fuss n’ bubblin’, eh, old Merlyn? Course, them tricks a yourn do have a way once upon a time of stirrin’ up a whole messpot of granny’s trouble stew … Like what when you done turnt the abbott into a giant rattler, and lived a long month trapped within his venomous stomach. Or that time when ya lost your way in the trail of spirits and had to die a death by fire so’s you could wake up the next morning livin’ again in these brittle bones. Hell, though, magic’s fun! Go ‘head!

[ M starts cackling, waving his hands in the air. ]

M [ chanting ]
Kalikazoo! Kalikazee! Enchantments of the ancients, work thy ways to me! Hibble-da-ree, hibble-da-roo, magic spells with magic words, and how do you do!

[ A cactus appears, with one “branch” (what do you call it on a cactus, anyway?) pointed upward, like a raised hand. ]

A
Now here’s a brave little rustle-buster!

[ A tries to pin a badge on the cactus, hurts himself, drops the badge. ]

A
Yeeeeowch! I’ll call you Deputy Lancelot, on account of all them stingers on your flesh, which is like a lot of lances to pierce the flesh of the faithless.

[ He tries again, hurts himself again, repeats. G is staring at the cactus, agog. ]

M
What’s got yer eyes locked to starin’ there, little lady? You done look like you been trapped in the gaze of the basilisk.

G
Maybe now it’s me fallin’ victim to sun’s hot brain-kisses, but that new deputy stirs up my sinning parts. A handsome brute with an angel’s sugared cheeks. I pledge my woman’s heart to him, heretofore.

M
Yikes! Even a horsey-mage like myself fears a case of Cactus-Courtin’! Yer ladyship’s got to focus her wiles on this here banditry! Here, eat a book!

[ He tosses a book to Guinevere, she chews a corner absently, then regains her composure. ]

G
Confound your Mustang Magics, old man! You don’t eat a book with your mouth! You eat it with your eyes!

[ She reads the book. ]

G
Aha! Says here in this here fancy book that bandits sometimes leave behind “clues!” Quick, everyone check your pockets for clues!

[ They empty their pockets. M and G are empty. A pulls out a two pieces of gold. M and G gasp. ]

M and G
That there thief!

A
Er, oh, heck!

[ A tosses the gold coins to M and G. ]

A
Quick, put ‘em in your pockets! Now check your pockets again!

[ They do. Arthur gasps. ]

A
That there theifs!

M
Well now I just don’t know what to get to thinking to considerin’ to ponder!

G
I’m more mixed up than a saddlebag full a’ moccassins!
[ to book ]
Aw, you ain’t no help! Thanks a lot … for bein’ dumb!

[ She throws the book in the air and shoots it. ]

A
Well Merlin’s magic ain’t helped none, and Guinny’s book-learnin’ -- though fancy -- has been about as helpful as a moccassin full a’ saddlebags. Why-abouts we just look around for that gold? Ya’ll look over there-like, not at me.

[ While M and G look elsewhere, A grabs the gold and throws it on the ground. ]

A
[ points ]
Hey that there!

G
[ points ]
Yonder!

M
[ points ]
It were on the Not-Sky!

A
Good job, me! As top Gold-Finder, I hereby claim the re-ward of All That There Gold.

[ A puts gold in pocket. M and G look sad. ]

G
Shoot.

M
Dangit.

A
Aw, heck. Tell ya what, gang. How ‘bout we use this here gold to unlock a new playable character? Ya’ll pick!

M
Ooh! Ooh! I wanna unlock Quark from Deep Space Nine!

G
No! Unlock Val Kilmer from The Saint!

M
Aw, Val Kilmer’s fatter’n a hornytoad what’s had it’s birthday pie!

G
Call me crazy, but I just don’t trust that them Ferengi!

A
Hmm … as King Sheriff I decree we shall henceforth unlock Quark from Deep Space Nine *dressed* as Fat Val Kilmer from The Saint!

G and M
Yay!!!

[ Lights out? ]




Arthur steals Guinevere and Merlyn's gold, immediately vows to catch the bandit. Arthur grabs a nearby cactus, names it Lancelot, deputizes it, and tells it to find the thief. Guinevere finds the cactus oddly alluring. Arthur gets his friends to help catch the bandit: Merlyn tries a spell (which somehow involves whittling), Guinevere tries fancy book learnin'. Arthur sabotages their efforts, then "discovers" a pile of gold. He uses the gold to unlock a new character and costume: Quark from DS9 dressed as Fat Val Kilmer from The Saint.






“They got a whole load a’ holy grails on that there dragon train!”

“I’m King Arthur, and these here are the Laws of my Court.”

Merlin is an old prospector.

Guinevere is a gross madam who is horrible to her workers.

“You gotta lot of gall, Sir Lancelot, showin’ yer helm around here.”

Guns are drawn and held with two hands like swords.

Bad stage combat. A swordfight with rifles.

Guinevere (Proprietor of “Guinevere’s Fancy Pleasures”) is the riverboat madam who came Castle Gulch to introduce the yokels to the pleasures of priveleged society. All of her ladies have taken etiquette classes.

robs them and then immediately promises to find the man responsible

“This is feminist steampunk!”

Dying of consumption

Etiquette classes, medieval square dancing (from Guinevere the classy madam)

GWYNEFFUD, GYRNAFAR, GWENHWYNFR, UHGBANSMFFYR, FINDABAIR

“Also, do you know what the modern version of Guinevere is … Jennifer.”

She is of a certain age. Tough as nails. Fish out of water (troubled past in new york?)

“And King Arthur’s still out there today ….”

“Them Saxons is out there, on the great plain, singin’ their song to the big old Spirit.”

“That’s Morgana, aka ‘Lily’ La Fey. I’d stay away from her, Marshal. She’s trouble.”

Talking about all the characters we can’t include because we don’t have enough actors. “Did you meet that handsome U.S. Marshal just arrived in town? Marshal Lance O. Lot.”
ARTHUR: “I don’t like him.” GUINEVERE: “I do!”
(later)
ARTHUR: I was wrong about Marshal Lance O. Lot. In the end we became great friends.
GUINEVERE: We did too!

Guinevere has a tiny sword / pistol strapped to her leg.

Merlin wants to turn Arthur into a coyote.

“We gotta get them horses to woo!”

[ Host introduces us. ]

[ 1. Opening Theme ]

[ JOEL, CURTIS, and COURTNEY enter carrying cardboard doors. We exit through the doors as Arsenio, Jimmy Zydeco, and Sheila E. Cheese, respectively. We each drop and then pick up newspapers, wave at each other. ]

[ Curtis and Courtney separate to the sides, exit. ]

[ 2. Transition Theme ]

[ Arsenio (Joel) has a cardboard cutout of the front of a bike. He sits downstage, facing the audience, in front of projector screen. ]

[ BEGIN VIDEO: driving around ]

[ Arsenio “peddles” to his composting class. Carol (Courtney) slides onstage, arranging papers. ]

[ END VIDEO ]

[ ARSENIO stands off to the side, arms crossed, wide stance. There is a table onstage with a sign taped to it that says “City Composting Class at the Meadowview Farmers Market, 10am”. A FAN is stage right, blowing on the performers. There is a rock on the ground. ]

[ CAROL holds up a piece of paper that says “WIND” which is blown away by the fan revealing another that says “AS REPRESENTED BY” which is blown away by the fan revealing another that says “A FAN”]

CAROL
Hello, my name’s Carol! Welcome to the City Composting Class! I cannot believe how blessed we are to be having this class out here on such a beautiful day! This is my first time doing this so if I miss anything or get anything wrong, Arsenio here is going to help me out.

[ She gestures to ARSENIO who gives a curt wave ]

ARSENIO
If anyone needs some sunscreen, it is very bright out, okay, I have a bag of sunscreen. [ ARSENIO takes out a ziplock bag with white liquid in it. ] I just squirted a bottle of sunscreen into this ziplock bag, okay, makes it more portable, easier for me to carry on my bike. I also have a bag of sanitizer. [ ARSENIO takes out a ziplock bag of clear liquid. ]

CAROL
Great. We need to protect ourselves from the sun. #1 rule of life. Now, you’ll need to change your 55 gallon trash can to a 32 gallon trash can to get your rebate...

ARSENIO
It costs you nothing to make this change. Literally nothing. Just a phone call. But you have to make sure you are ready to make the move to a smaller trash can, that you are really really ready, okay? Because if you change your mind, they will charge you $15. Can you imagine what you can do with $15? Perhaps 3 $5 pizzas? You could get a new tube for my bike. You would fund a documentary my friend is making in my native Patagonia about cheese. So make sure you are ready to make the change, okay?

CAROL
Good point, Arsenio! If I had $15 I think I’d donate it back to the city composting program so that more people could enjoy composting!

[ JASON strolls in wearing his sunglasses and sipping coffee. He never takes the sunglasses off ]

CAROL
And here’s our instructor, Jason! We’re so honored to have him here. He has his masters and degrees in environmental science and he does this professionally so let’s give him a hand!

[CAROL applauds enthusiastically. ARSENIO casually applauds. ]

JASON
Thanks. Thanks. I apologize, I’m a little tired, I’ve been out fighting the war on trash all morning, I was up until 2am, fighting the war on trash because it is a war, okay? There are two masses of trash in the ocean, each bigger than Texas. Google it. Don’t do everything I say.

CAROL
I googled it and there were so many of those six pack rings out there. You can use those in your closet to save space and reduce waste.

JASON
Thanks, Carol. Okay, the first thing you need to start composting is “green materials” from your kitchen.

[ CAROL holds up an informative poster about “green materials”. It blows around helplessly in the wind and she fights with it. The wind also blows random bits of paper around, which ARSENIO collects and piles up and puts the rock on. ]

CAROL
[ mouthing to ARSENIO ] Thank you.

[ ARSENIO gives CAROL a casual “no problem” wave. CAROL holds up the poster and fights with it. ]

JASON
If it grows it goes. Those are the green materials. Tea, coffee, vegetables and fruits. Food waste is what it’s called. Food waste is a very new term. No one had food waste before. They wouldn’t know what you meant if you said “food waste”. It is a well known fact that garbage was invented in WWI.

ARSENIO
If I told my mother in Patagonia what food waste was, okay, she would say “what are you saying, Arsenio?” and then I would explain this abstract, unknowable concept to her. And then she would cry, okay? Because she is a native of ten thousand years of Patagonia and she does not understand food waste, okay?

CAROL
If you squeeze a lemon, pop the spent lemon halves into your garbage disposal, turn it on and your whole house will smell like lemons!

JASON
Exactly right, Carol. Next we have “brown materials”.

[ CAROL struggles to replace the poster she’s holding with a new poster without either of them flying away. She bumps into the table and knocks over JASON’s coffee. ARSENIO and CAROL react as if some precious or toxic liquid just spilled. ]

CAROL
[ urgently,  excitedly ]
The coffee! The coffee! Oh, god, the coffee!

ARSENIO
The coffee!

[ ARSENIO rights the coffee ]

CAROL
[ mouthing to ARSENIO ] Thank you.

[ ARSENIO gives CAROL a casual “no problem” wave. CAROL holds up the next poster, struggles with it. ]

JASON
Brown waste is your leaves, sticks, pizza boxes, shredded paper, dried grass clippings. [ looks behind him for a moment, distractedly ] I was gonna take some mulch from under one of these trees to show you but unfortunately they’re not mulched. Guys, if you have trees at home, mulch them, please. Please mulch your trees.

CAROL
I take shredded paper from my office and use it to mulch my trees. I just go up to Deb in accounting and she gives me as much shredded paper as I want. Go to Starbucks and ask for their old coffee grounds and they’ll just give them to you, they’ll say “here”.

[ CAROL struggles to switch out posters ]

JASON
Next, you need water. Your compost should be wet like a wrung out sponge. These microbes which are breaking down your waste are just like you and me, they need air and water to live. They work day and night, they don’t call in sick, they don’t take vacations.

ARSENIO
My father in Patagonia, he works day and night, okay, and my mother in Patagonia, she cooks day and night and I come here and I work on film crews, okay, and I see the craft services table filled with cheeses and bagels and pineapples, okay, and I think of them and how they would like to just eat food off a big banquet table that people just come by and take food off of, okay?

[ CAROL struggles to switch out posters ]

JASON
You know what? It’s fine. We don’t need them. It’s fine. Just...

[ CAROL and JASON  and the wind struggle over the posters. CAROL wins.  --”It’s the only thing I can do.”]

JASON
The next thing you need is air. You gotta get that air in there. The microbes need the air. They need it. Listen, don’t buy fertilizers. Don’t. You don’t need it. You don’t. You make all the fertilizer you will ever need. Because....mulch your trees. You see?

ARSENIO
My mother, in Pategonia...

JASON
Can it, Arsenio. Can it. Put it in a can. Give it to someone else. Don’t throw it away, give it away. Who here gardens vegetables and fruits? How would you feel if I took half of your garden and just threw it away, if I just pulled tomatoes right out of your garden and smashed them into the dirt? Because that’s what we’re doing. We’re taking the world’s tomatoes from the world’s garden and grinding them into our selfish dirt. Because we’re just depleting....I depleted it. I depleted the soil. It was me. I did it. I depleted it. [ JASON starts to break down crying ] It was me.

CAROL
I find Nora Jones is the best composting music.

[ CAROL presses a button on a small remote control. ]

[ 3. Come Away With Me ]

JASON
We’re not ready for 7 billion people. We’re gonna be 9 billion soon. We’re not ready. If you go down to the Meadowview Optimist Club, where all the kids play baseball, you’ll see what I mean. You’ll see what I mean about the war on trash.

CAROL
I like to take a pinecone and fill the spaces in between the scales with potpourri. It makes an attractive centerpiece and air freshener.

JASON
I don’t think they need your Pintrest tips, Carol. Can your Pintrest tips. Put them in a can. Arsenio, is there room in that can? Share the can. Share the can. My fiance says that I spend too much time working and I’m just not cleaning out the compost container often enough so, okay, Tiff, we’ll get rid of it. I had to get rid of my compost container. The very thing I urge people to use every day, I had to get rid of it. I don’t have one anymore. I’m a fraud. Who am I? Who am I, Tiff? Who? Am? I?

[ pause ]

Okay, I think that’s everything. Oh, they say you can put pet feces in there but don’t put pet feces in there. I think that’s it. I’m just being improv here, I hope I covered everything. Thank you, Carol, thank you, Arsenio, I hope you all have successful composting!

[ JASON wanders off. ]

CAROL
That...was inspirational.

[ ARSENIO gives an approving nod. ]

CAROL
Okay, so just see me for your rebate certificate....

[ CAROL holds up the papers which blow everywhere. ARSENIO and CAROL rush to collect them. Their movements become more graceful, and suddenly, they are dancing. ]

[ 4. Father Figure ]

[ Courtney and Joel do a dorky dance/magic routine during which they change costumes and set for the next sketch. ]

[ Courtney, Joel, and Curtis all in their zydeco outfits with their backs to the audience. ]

[ 5. Zydeco ]

[ They turn around and start jukin’. ]

ZB1
Hi. I'm Jimmy Zydeco, and this is my brother.

ZB2
I'm Jimmy Zydeco.

JENNY
And I’m Jenny Zydeco!

ZB1
We're the Zydeco brothers. Are you a Zydeco band in the north Austin area?

ZB2
Have you noticed fewer and fewer people having a good time at your Zydeco concerts or zydeco related events?

JENNY
We have a solution for you. You see, we love dancing to zydeco more than you enjoy writing and playing it, probably.

ZB2
So, Jimmy, let's tell them our idea.

ZB1
Good idea. We'll show them our idea. For five bucks we'll dance at your show.

JENNY
You'll see “The Bayou Bounce.”

[ They dance. ]

ZB1
Another fiver will get you “The Creole Shuffle.”

[ They dance. ]

JENNY
Maybe you’ll also enjoy, “The Crocidile Smile Mile.”

[ They dance. ]

ZB1
Or “The Out-Of-Control Fanboat.”

[ They dance. ]

ZB2
How about a “Hot Bowl of Gumbo”?

And for the band who spares no expense ...

ZB2
Twenty dollars gets you “The Ol' Lou-sana Whoop and Holler.”

[ They dance. ]

ZB1
So call today and we'll be dancing at your Zydeco concert, Mardi Gras party, Zydeco-themed birthday, wedding, bridal shower, retirement party, bar mitzvah, or other Zydeco-related personal or professional event tomorrow.

JENNY
Just pick up that phone and start dialin’ numbers. You’re bound to reach one of us.

ZB2
People think we all live together. We don’t! Call us if you wanna hang out!

ZB1
We're pretty fun, and our curious attempt at life makes us kind of interesting.

ZB2
Hey! Yeah, I like us!

ZB1
Me too. We're not bad guys.

ZB2
I'm perfectly fine with who I am!

JENNY
See you at the show. Now let's get swampy!

[ Joel and Courtney dance off, Curtis says goodbye to them. ]

[ 6. Transition Theme ]

[ He starts walking the Red Balloon walk. He passes a tree (Joel) reaches his car. He drives, encounters a man (Joel). He drives off. ]

JOEL
No time to talk to this man about his little car. I have a show to host!

[ Turns suddenly to audience. ]

JOEL
What, we’re starting now? OK.

[ LIGHTS DIM. ]

WOMAN:
I’m sorry?

CALLER
Hot glue?

WOMAN
What?

CALLER
Hot...hot glue?

WOMAN
I’m not understanding.

CALLER
Hot glue...glue.

WOMAN
No, I’m good. Thank you.

[ Two dudes stand up in the audience, yelling and screaming. They are wearing shirts that, together, spell out “SHOW IT TO ME” (or they have it painted on their chests). They run around. ]

MAN:
Looks like we’ve got a couple fans. Come on up here!

[ The two dudes are stunned by their good luck and look like they are going to have a heart attack. They got onstage, sit on each side of Sheila, exchange high fives. ]

MAN:
Thanks. Chas D. calling from somewhere in the studio, you’re on Show Me Your Craft.

[ VIDEO: SLIDE 4 ]

WOMAN:
Was that your question, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

MAN:
Thanks, Chuck.

[ Chuck enters. ]

CALLER:
I finally made it, y’all. This is so great.

CALLER:
Yeah!

MAN:
Sheila, you remember Chuck? From the phone calls.

WOMAN:
OK.

CALLER:
I got another question.

WOMAN:
Great.

CALLER:
If you happened upon a Surge can would you use it for one of your angels?

WOMAN:
Yes, I suppose I would.

CALLER:
What if I told you I had a Surge can? Would you use that specific one?

WOMAN:
Sure.

CALLER:
If I had a Surge can and gave it to you would you use it?

WOMAN:
Yes I would. I think that would be kind of fun.

MAN:
That would be fun. Chuck, give her that Surge can.

WOMAN:
I can make you a special Chuck angel.

Do you have a Surge can, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

[ 22. Crowd Pop ]

Yes.

[ 23. Crowd Pop ]

No. Can I see that coke can angel?

Oh yes.

MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it’s time to …

[ 24. Chant ]

[ Sheila lifts the box, revealing the angel. ]

[ Two guys onstage look a little disappointed. ]

CALLER:
This isn’t really my kind of thing. When you guys were telling me bout it I got really excited. I had so many questions I couldn’t think straight. Now that I see it, no thank you.

[ He hands the angel back to WOMAN and walks away. ]

CALLER:
See you guys later.

[ The two dudes quietly excuse themselves and go. Long pause. ]

MAN:
Well, that was a complete embarrassment. Guess we’re never doing this show again.

WOMAN:
I’m sorry.

[ Man buries his head in his hands. ]

MAN:
Jesus, do you have any idea how much it cost to rent this stadium? Jesus, Glon, what were you thinking?

WOMAN:
I had a nice time talking about my angels with you.

MAN:
Get out. Just go, please.

WOMAN:
I mean, what did you think it was going to--

MAN:
Not that! I don’t know, but not that!

[ 27. Good Riddance ]

[ Arsenio crosses to middle of stage, walks sadly, in place, toward the audience. ]

[ Sheila re-enters, falls into formation. So does Jimmy Zydeco. ]

[ They get back to their doors. They greet each other. They are about to go into their own homes. Then, they rip up the doors, have a group hug. ]

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ 28. Opening Theme ]

[ MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Curtis, Courtney, and Joel do a quick intro. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change with MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A writer at a typewriter or keyboard or just pretending to type in the air ]

WRITER:
Where do I begin? How do I describe my time with the master? With Mr. Stanislav Actislavski himself? I certainly had heard whispers of him in the high school drama room, but we had no need for acting styles with our half-cocked restagings of Our Town and Carousel. I heard rumblings of him in my college drama courses and during load ins, but we paid little attention to old masters while staging our crude, gender challenging modernizations of Euripides and Aristophanes. But the first time I saw one of his pupils on the silver screen, I was entranced. The rawness, the vulnerability was seeping from the rafters of the theater and I could only think one thing: "Who taught him how to do that?" I made my way to the village where Master Activslavski kept his small, no

[ WRITER backspaces ]

modest teaching space and theater. I remember my first interaction with him as if it were yesterday. By the time I met him he was 95 years old but still sharp as a tack.

[ The scene seamlessly melds into an interaction between STANISLAV ACTISLAVSKI and WRITER. STANISLAV ENTERS using a cane and only yells in a monotone. WRITER kneels before STANISLAV. ]

STANISLAV:
Don't kneel, you imbecile. Get up! So, you want to be an actor.

WRITER:
Yes, master. Very much.

STANISLAV:
Don't call me master, what are you a dog?

WRITER:
Yes, master.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
There's nothing very special about you. You're not particularly good looking, not particularly charismatic or interesting....What's your name, boy?

WRITER:
Daniel, master.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, there is a coffee shop in the Bronx called Great Joe's Adventure Cafe and Muffler Repair. Do you know it? Bring me a small black coffee from there by the time my next class starts and I will bring you on as my apprentice.

[ WRITER RETURNS to his writing station while STANISLAV gets ready for his acting class he's about to teach ]

WRITER:
And get that small cup of coffee I did. And many more following that. Sure, it was a two hour round trip subway ride each day for what all I could figure was a slightly less than mediocre small cup of coffee. And sometimes I'd have to go twice a day, leaving me to wonder why he didn't just order a large cup of coffee on the first trip. But it was worth it. I learned so much under the master. I learned that he'd been hit by a freight train while still living in Russia and that's why he used a cane. I learned that he'd lost the use of his normal speaking voice whilst traveling to the states by boat and had to yell everything he said. I learned the true root of human need and how to touch the ET inside. ET, that's what ACTISLAVSKI called your "emotion tip". Everyone has one.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I need you!

[ WRITER EXITS, picks up a coffee from offstage and ENTERS in as if he's late for class ]

WRITER:
I'm sorry, Master, there was a MTA strike. I had to walk the whole way.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, get on the stage with Anna.

[ ANNA ENTERS from the audience, as if she's in the class ]

STANISLAV:
Do you think Anna's attractive?

DANIEL: [ embarrassed ]
Uh, yeah.

STANISLAV:
You're wrong. She's just as boring and unattractive as you are. Let's see if we can't breathe some life into you two turds on a log. Look at her. Really look into her eyes. Say what you see.

DANIEL:
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
No, no, no, no! Don't talk to her! Don't speak directly to her! Like she's a person! She's not a person!

DANIEL: [ dismissively ]
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
Very nice! How did that feel?

DANIEL:
Good, uh, really good.

STANISLAV:
Anna. Look into Daniel's eyes. Say what you see.

ANNA:
You seem pensive.

STANISLAV:
Oh, god. Boring! That is the most boring thing I have ever heard. Listen, when are you people going to learn?

[ STANISLAV addresses the class/audience and then conducts them like an orchestra ]

STANISLAV, DANIEL, ANNA:
Touch the ET inside.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
Thank you! Anna, try again.

ANNA:
You seem........pensive?

STANISLAV:
Finally! How was that for you?

ANNA:
I, uh, really felt my ET.

STANISLAV:
Good, good girl. I think you've really learned something today. I think you might have had a breakthrough. In fact, you get to start doing face ups. Daniel, sit here.

[ DANIEL sits next to STANISLAV ]

STANISLAV:
Now Anna, I want you to kneel on the ground. Good. Put your face up. Okay. Now I want you to think of the most painful thing that could ever happen to you. You got that?

[ ANNA nods ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Now multiply that times 43. You should really feel your ET growing. It should feel like it's just touching the inside of your ribs. It should grow and grow till you feel it pushing on the walls of your chest and then it will feel like it's going to poke out of your heart.

[ ANNA is on the floor, weeping ]

STANISLAV:
Good, good, that's enough for today.

[ ANNA goes back to her seat, sniffling ]

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I want you to get up and do a window. Did you bring your Cleaning Object?

DANIEL: [ taking out a handkerchief ]
Yes.

STANISLAV:
Tell me about it.

DANIEL:
It was my Grandfather's. My Grandmother kept it on her at all times after he died. Then, after she died, I got it.

STANISLAV:
I asked you to bring in something personal.

DANIEL:
But my Grandfather...

STANISLAV:
I heard what you said. It needs to be something personal. I'm looking for the towel you used to clean the blood off your face after that drunken fight. Or that shirt you were wearing when you first banged that really hot piece of ass you'd been wanting for months. What's this, a rag your Grandpappy carried around with him? Crap. [ pause ] It will have to do for today. Do your window.

[ DANIEL mimes wiping a window ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. You want to clean the window without really touching it. Really connect with your cleaning object. Stop.

[ DANIEL stops ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. [ slowly as if speaking to someone who is hard of hearing ] Clean it.

[ DANIEL starts the wiping motion again ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Good, Daniel.

[ DANIEL returns to his typing chair while STANISLAV continues the class like his still there ]

DANIEL:
The things I learned. I learned that people don't have brown eyes, they have

I got to deliver the eulogy at the old man's funeral. He hasn't died yet, but he figured he'd have a funeral while most of the people he knew were still alive. You know what else?

Serves him right, the bastard. Twelve years, I give to him. He won't marry me, he can't hold down no honest labor and I give my life to him anyhow. He's no good, mister. Ain't nothin' but a big stinking brute. And when he gets drunk, he gets awful mean. But you know, other times, when he gets drunk...

This show is going to be UNDER 15 MINUTES. We are going to arrange to have it recorded and then use it as our submission for NY Sketchfest.

TCP will open for us, and they will also be doing a short show that they can record for submissions of this type.

Brandon will record the shows. TCP will bring someone to record their show. Maybe we can share footage afterward in order to get two angles? Also, maybe Curtis can bring his audio recorder in order to get a good source of audio?

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A writer at a typewriter or keyboard or just pretending to type in the air ]

WRITER:
Where do I begin? How do I describe my time with the master? With Mr. Stanislav Actislavski himself? I certainly had heard whispers of him in the high school drama room, but we had no need for acting styles with our half-cocked restagings of Our Town and Carousel. I heard rumblings of him in my college drama courses and during load ins, but we paid little attention to old masters while staging our crude, gender challenging modernizations of Euripides and Aristophanes. But the first time I saw one of his pupils on the silver screen, I was entranced. The rawness, the vulnerability was seeping from the rafters of the theater and I could only think one thing: "Who taught him how to do that?" I made my way to the village where Master Activslavski kept his small, no

[ WRITER backspaces ]

modest teaching space and theater. I remember my first interaction with him as if it were yesterday. By the time I met him he was 95 years old but still sharp as a tack.

[ The scene seamlessly melds into an interaction between STANISLAV ACTISLAVSKI and WRITER. STANISLAV ENTERS using a cane and only yells in a monotone. WRITER kneels before STANISLAV. ]

STANISLAV:
Don't kneel, you imbecile. Get up! So, you want to be an actor.

WRITER:
Yes, master. Very much.

STANISLAV:
Don't call me master, what are you a dog?

WRITER:
Yes, master.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
There's nothing very special about you. You're not particularly good looking, not particularly charismatic or interesting....What's your name, boy?

WRITER:
Daniel, master.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, there is a coffee shop in the Bronx called Great Joe's Adventure Cafe and Muffler Repair. Do you know it? Bring me a small black coffee from there by the time my next class starts and I will bring you on as my apprentice.

[ WRITER RETURNS to his writing station while STANISLAV gets ready for his acting class he's about to teach ]

WRITER:
And get that small cup of coffee I did. And many more following that. Sure, it was a two hour round trip subway ride each day for what all I could figure was a slightly less than mediocre small cup of coffee. And sometimes I'd have to go twice a day, leaving me to wonder why he didn't just order a large cup of coffee on the first trip. But it was worth it. I learned so much under the master. I learned that he'd been hit by a freight train while still living in Russia and that's why he used a cane. I learned that he'd lost the use of his normal speaking voice whilst traveling to the states by boat and had to yell everything he said. I learned the true root of human need and how to touch the ET inside. ET, that's what ACTISLAVSKI called your "emotion tip". Everyone has one.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I need you!

[ WRITER EXITS, picks up a coffee from offstage and ENTERS in as if he's late for class ]

WRITER:
I'm sorry, Master, there was a MTA strike. I had to walk the whole way.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, get on the stage with Anna.

[ ANNA ENTERS from the audience, as if she's in the class ]

STANISLAV:
Do you think Anna's attractive?

DANIEL: [ embarrassed ]
Uh, yeah.

STANISLAV:
You're wrong. She's just as boring and unattractive as you are. Let's see if we can't breathe some life into you two turds on a log. Look at her. Really look into her eyes. Say what you see.

DANIEL:
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
No, no, no, no! Don't talk to her! Don't speak directly to her! Like she's a person! She's not a person!

DANIEL: [ dismissively ]
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
Very nice! How did that feel?

DANIEL:
Good, uh, really good.

STANISLAV:
Anna. Look into Daniel's eyes. Say what you see.

ANNA:
You seem pensive.

STANISLAV:
Oh, god. Boring! That is the most boring thing I have ever heard. Listen, when are you people going to learn?

[ STANISLAV addresses the class/audience and then conducts them like an orchestra ]

STANISLAV, DANIEL, ANNA:
Touch the ET inside.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
Thank you! Anna, try again.

ANNA:
You seem........pensive?

STANISLAV:
Finally! How was that for you?

ANNA:
I, uh, really felt my ET.

STANISLAV:
Good, good girl. I think you've really learned something today. I think you might have had a breakthrough. In fact, you get to start doing face ups. Daniel, sit here.

[ DANIEL sits next to STANISLAV ]

STANISLAV:
Now Anna, I want you to kneel on the ground. Good. Put your face up. Okay. Now I want you to think of the most painful thing that could ever happen to you. You got that?

[ ANNA nods ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Now multiply that times 43. You should really feel your ET growing. It should feel like it's just touching the inside of your ribs. It should grow and grow till you feel it pushing on the walls of your chest and then it will feel like it's going to poke out of your heart.

[ ANNA is on the floor, weeping ]

STANISLAV:
Good, good, that's enough for today.

[ ANNA goes back to her seat, sniffling ]

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I want you to get up and do a window. Did you bring your Cleaning Object?

DANIEL: [ taking out a handkerchief ]
Yes.

STANISLAV:
Tell me about it.

DANIEL:
It was my Grandfather's. My Grandmother kept it on her at all times after he died. Then, after she died, I got it.

STANISLAV:
I asked you to bring in something personal.

DANIEL:
But my Grandfather...

STANISLAV:
I heard what you said. It needs to be something personal. I'm looking for the towel you used to clean the blood off your face after that drunken fight. Or that shirt you were wearing when you first banged that really hot piece of ass you'd been wanting for months. What's this, a rag your Grandpappy carried around with him? Crap. [ pause ] It will have to do for today. Do your window.

[ DANIEL mimes wiping a window ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. You want to clean the window without really touching it. Really connect with your cleaning object. Stop.

[ DANIEL stops ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. [ slowly as if speaking to someone who is hard of hearing ] Clean it.

[ DANIEL starts the wiping motion again ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Good, Daniel.

[ DANIEL returns to his typing chair while STANISLAV continues the class like his still there ]

DANIEL:
The things I learned. I learned that people don't have brown eyes, they have

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes. And people don't seem pensive. They seem....pensive? I learned how to stop wiping windows and start CLEANING windows. And you know what else.

TRACY:
Well, Bradley, you are welcome anytime.

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

[ Characters return to their original positions. The following dialogue is delivered double time with confusion and awareness of it's repetition. ]

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

TRACY:
It was nothing.

MARK:
Tracy, that was delicious. Now, I remember why I married you.

TRACY:
Mark, you are awful.

BRADLEY:
I haven't had a meal that good since...I don't know when.

TRACY:
Well, Bradley, you are welcome anytime.

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

[ Original positions. The pace quickens snd they are physically attempting to resist. ]

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

TRACY:
It was nothing.

MARK:
Tracy, that was delicious. Now, I remember why I married you.

TRACY:
Mark, you are awful.

BRADLEY:
I haven't had a meal that good since...I don't know when.

TRACY:
Well, Bradley, you are welcome anytime.

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

[ They all go limp as if being released from a painful grip. ]

TRACY:
What was that?

BRADLEY:
I don't know.

MARK:
It must be some kind of glitch in time.

BRADLEY:
Like a temporal worm hole?

MARK:
Exactly.

TRACY:
That's stupid.

MARK:
Exactly.

BRADLEY:
Like a temporal worm hole?

MARK:
It must be some kind of glitch in time.

BRADLEY:
I don't know.

TRACY:
What was that?

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

[ TRACY and MARK give BRADLEY a look. ]

BRADLEY:
Just kidding.

MARK and TRACY:
Bradley, you are awful.

[ BRADLEY laughs. Mark and Tracy repeat 'Bradley you are awful' and Bradley laughs over and over. After a few rounds they all pick up their dinner knives and press them to their wrists. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. The neighbors say good night to the audience. ]




This show is going to be UNDER 15 MINUTES. We are going to arrange to have it recorded and then use it as our submission for NY Sketchfest.

TCP will open for us, and they will also be doing a short show that they can record for submissions of this type.

Brandon will record the shows. TCP will bring someone to record their show. Maybe we can share footage afterward in order to get two angles? Also, maybe Curtis can bring his audio recorder in order to get a good source of audio?

AUDIO CUE #2
[ LIGHTS UP on A GUY AND A GIRL, each lounging on a couch. They are watching TV and clearly stoned. ]

GUY:
This is the best movie ever.

GIRL:
This is the worst movie ever.

GUY:
Exactly.

GIRL:
Cool.

[ The guy pulls up his shirt and begins poking his finger into his navel. The girl begins blowing into her own elbow pit. ]

GIRL:
I'm hungry.

GUY:
I'm hungry.

GIRL:
There are noodles.

GUY:
There are noodles on the stove.

GIRL:
But.

GUY:
But?

GIRL:
... we have to get the noodles.

GUY:
Only one of us.

GIRL:
One of us has to get the noodles.

[ Long pause. ]

GUY:
Yes.

[ Long pause. ]

GIRL:
You.

GUY:
No, you.

GIRL:
But here's the thing ... you.

GUY:
I understand, and you make a compelling point. However, you.

GIRL:
No, but see, think about it: you.

GUY:
Listen listen listen listen hey ... shhh, shhh. You.

GIRL:
I can't even hear what you're saying, because: you.

GUY:
My stomach's growling, and it's going: yoooooooooooooooou.

GIRL:
I wrote a song for you and it goes you you you yooooou.

GUY:
Hey, remember the time that we you?

GIRL:
No it wasn't like that. It was like: you.

GUY:
No, that was the other time.

GIRL:
Shut up. Also: you.

GUY:
Youuuuu.

GIRL:
Youuuuuuuuuuuu.

GUY:

GIRL: [ simultaneously ]
You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you--

GUY:
Wait.

GIRL:
OK.

GUY:
This is stupid.

GIRL:
It is.

GUY:
If you get the noodles right now, I will 100% for real give you a million dollars that I have.

GIRL:
Shut up.

GUY:
For real I have a million dollars that I will pay you for noodles. All you have to do is go and get them. It is literally ridiculous that I am offering you this amount of money, but I am. I probably won't forgive myself. Like, ever. But I want those noodles. Do you want to be rich?

[ Long pause. Slowly (veeeery slowly), she begins to roll off the couch. Each movement is protracted and painful, and she groans as she moves. She tries to slither offstage like a snake; it doesn't work, so she starts moving on her hands and knees instead, groaning all the way. Halfway across the stage, she pulls out her phone and calls the guy in order to groan at him. Finally, she makes it off the stage. She gets two bowls of noodles, pushes them along the ground onstage as she continues crawling on her hands and knees. With great effort, she makes it back on her couch. Both of them balance the bowls of noodles on their bellies and eat with their hands. ]

GUY:
Thank you.

GIRL:
Meeeeeeeeh.

GUY:
Here is the thing. I do not have a million dollars.

[ Long pause. Girl throws some noodles on the guy's face. He opens his mouth to bite at the noodles. ]

GUY:
My life is 100% the best.

GIRL:
You're a big ding-dong.

GUY:
No, you.

[ Long pause. She throws more noodles at his face. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

AUDIO CUE #3
[ LIGHTS UP on two office drones, sitting and typing facing forward at the edge of the stage.

The first one reaches a stopping point. She leaps out of her chair and begins doing some basic stretches. She goes on as the other one keeps typing. ]

ONE:
It's a productivity system. I work for thirty minutes straight, and then I stretch for thirty seconds to keep my body awake.

It's a proven fact that frequent short breaks maintain the mind's ability to focus. Our ancestors didn't evolve in offices, after all. They evolved on great, stretching plains. The Serengeti. They honed their instincts while hunting for tigers and the majestic water buffalo.

[ She reaches into a bag and pulls out a sweatband, which she puts on her head. ]

I'm really getting in the groove, I think.

Another thing that's important at work is minimizing distractions. Our digital age presents a lot of distractions. For example, e-mail. How many minutes a day do you suppose are wasted by people checking their inboxes? OK, take that number, and double it. Then triple it. Now it's a big number. You see? So I have one email alert that goes off three times a day. Anything I can respond to in less than one minute, I respond to it immediately. The others I flag for a more detailed response later in the day. So, for example, observe, like this: respond, flag, respond, flag, respond, respond, interesting, do I need it, no, delete, spam, spam, spam, interesting, but ... archive, to a labeled folder "email from mom," straight to my heart.

[ He gets out of the chair and goes into a downward-facing dog pose. ]

Blood rushes to the head, frees the mind, and you're ready for some more work, yoga-style.

[ She does a few more simple poses, breathes deep ostentatiously. ]

You can't think of it like office work, you know. You have to think of it as battle. Because that's what our bodies evolved for. Battle. We are physical creatures. We are warriors. As a woman, my body is calibrated for three things: battle, child-rearing, and organization. But you have to be the peaceful warrior. Stillness in motion. It's judo. It's leverage. You use the force of the work against itself.

[ She stands up, gets in a judo pose. ]

So the work comes at me, and I just --

[ Judo moves. ]

And then --

[ Judo moves. ]

So, suddenly, it's five a clock, and I'm not even tired. Because I just made the work do itself. With mind judo. People work too hard, you know? You have to value your weekends. You know how many people die from stress-related heart problems, all because of a little stupid work? It's ridiculous.

You know what else is ridiculous? Chicago-style pizza. I mean, I like it OK. I like eating it. But the idea that it's really some kind of style, that's ridiculous. It's some kind of bread bowl. It's not a concept for a pizza.

That was just some small talk. You can't talk about work all the time.

TWO
Janice. I'm really trying to play Farmville. It's a game on the internet where I run an imaginary farm. I just got a pig. I need to build a fence for the pig.

[ Their eyes meet. Long pause. ]

TWO
Janice, it's all I have.

[ Long pause. ]

ONE
Maybe I'll take lunch.

[ She starts to leave. ]

ONE
If anyone needs me, I'm eating a cup o' noodles on the elliptical. [yelling back to him ] This is the best first day ever!

[ SHE EXITS. He looks at the monitor. ]

TWO
There you go, you little porker.

[ He sniffs sadly. LIGHTS OUT. ]

AUDIO CUE #4
[ LIGHTS UP ON A VENDOR. He has a small crate of oranges. A sign: “Farm Fresh Oranges for Sale”. The vendor is setting up a second sign, which shows an arrow pointing to the vendor: “Want to buy an orange to eat? Talk to this man.” He is wearing pajama pants, flip flops, and a Mr. & Mrs. Smith shirt. He reaches over to the oranges, hesitates.  ]

VENDOR
Today’s the big day, guys. Today’s the day.

[ He sits. ]

VENDOR [ yelling ]
Farm fresh oranges!! Get your farm fresh oranges! If you like farm fresh oranges, I got ‘em! Get them from me! Buy some farm fresh oranges!

[ A WOMAN ENTERS. ]

VENDOR
Farm fre--

[ The vendor stops in mid-sentence, tries to look inconspicuous. ]

WOMAN
Selling oranges?

VENDOR
Yes -- no -- maybe -- whatever -- why? -- what do you want?

[ He tries to fold the sign over hurriedly. ]

WOMAN
I’d like to buy an orange or two.

VENDOR
Okay, so what do I care?

WOMAN
It says that you’re selling oranges.

VENDOR
No.

WOMAN
The sign.

[ She points at it. ]

VENDOR
It’s an old sign. So, like, if you like reading old signs, read it again, what do I care?

WOMAN
OK, well, fuck you.

VENDOR
No!

[ She starts to leave. ]

VENDOR
Ma’am, ma’am. Just kidding. It’s a joke. I’m selling oranges.

[ The woman looks at him, narrow-eyed. ]

VENDOR
It’s a joke I have with my friends.

[ He starts laughing. She starts laughing. ]

WOMAN
So how much are the oranges?

[ He stops. He gestures for her to come over. She leans in, bends her ear. ]

VENDOR
I’m not selling oranges!! 
WOMAN
Fuck you!

[ She punches him in the chest. Vendor is alarmed. ]

VENDOR
Wait wait. Reboot. Let’s reboot. Let’s start this over. Look. I’m selling oranges. It’s true. But these oranges are really special to me. They’re fresh from the farm. Not just anybody deserves these oranges, OK? OK?

[ She looks at him skeptically. ]

WOMAN
These are good oranges?

VENDOR
These are the best oranges I’ve ever tasted, and seriously, I’m not saying that becuase I grew them on my orange farm. I’m not saying that because I plucked them off my orange bush with my own two hands.

WOMAN
Oranges grow on bushes?

VENDOR
They grow on ... a plant. It’s immaterial. The point is, when I first tasted one of these oranges, I felt like my taste buds had called me up for an all-night hardcore fuckfest in my mouth. Pardon my French. I tried to kill myself.

WOMAN
Why?

VENDOR
Because what’s the point? Look at me. I never dress like this. Never. But now, after this orange, what’s the point?

WOMAN
How much are they?

VENDOR
Three for two ... I mean, one hundred dollars apiece.

WOMAN
That’s insane. There’s a guy a mile down who sells them for four bucks a pound.

VENDOR
That’s a fair price for an orange that’s got crap in it.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
He craps in his oranges.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
He craps in his oranges.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
I’ve reported it several times.

WOMAN
He does not crap in his oranges.

VENDOR
He might as well.

WOMAN
What does that mean?

VENDOR
His oranges taste like crap. Like a big crap.

WOMAN
OK. Well, look, it’s been a few minutes already, and it kind of feels like a lot longer than that--

VENDOR
Time flies when you’re having fun.

WOMAN
Right, that’s the opposite. So let’s just get this clear: Is there any way on earth I’ll be leaving this interaction with some oranges?

[ Pause. ]

VENDOR
Probably not.

WOMAN
OK, well. I wish I could say this has been fun. Good luck to you, I guess?

VENDOR
Thanks, I really don’t make it that far with most people.

[ She leaves. He sits. ]

VENDOR
Good luck ... to me!

[ He looks at his oranges. ]

VENDOR
It’s gonna happen today, fellas. We’re really gonna make it happen.

[ He calls out again. ]

VENDOR
Oranges! Oranges fresh from a farm! Naranjas frescas!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

AUDIO CUE #5
[ LIGHTS UP. JOEL ENTERS. ]

JOEL:
OK, you want a sketch? You want a funny comedy sketch? Here's a funny comedy sketch that I just wrote. Hope you enjoy it! It starts with a little song.

[ Joel sings. ]

Courtney, the big stupid jerk
Always wants me to work
But she doesn't understand
I'm a hard-working man
She don't appreciate my work
What a jerk!
Thaaaaaaaat's Courtney!

[ Joel assumes a ridiculous feminine posture. ]

I'm Courtney, and I think I'm so cool that I can tell Joel what to do, just because I made a baby with my womb and my husband rides a cool motorcycle! Look at me! Look at my cooooooool haircut! Look at my cooooool towels! My laptop's the biggest laptop! WOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

[ Joel assumes a friendly, innocent posture. ]

Hey, Courtney, I'm really sorry, I had a really lousy week at work, so I'm a little shaky on my lines for that one sketch you wrote.

[ Joel assumes the Courtney posture again. ]

OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A STUPID DUMMY, I'm GONNA HAVE MAD CRAZY ANGRY PMS RIGHT NOW ALL OVER YOUR DUMB HEAD!

[ Joel assumes the Joel posture. ]

Courtney, that's not fair! I've been working hard! Besides, remember that one time that --

[ Joel assumes the Courtney pose. ]

There was never any time that I was ever wrong about anything ever because I have the best towels and the biggest laptop!! So shut your stupid mouth or I'll yell at you again!

[ COURTNEY ENTERS with a plate of mini-muffins. ]

COURTNEY:
Hey Joel, I'm sorry I was being kind of a B before the show, so I snuck out of the theater and baked you a quick plate of mini-muffins.

[ Joel stops, looks nervous. ]

Are you OK, Joely?

JOEL:
I was just -- no I just -- it's OK, I just -- abuh -- ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaa -- buuuuuh.

COURTNEY:
Joel ...

[ Joel looks ashamed. ]

Joel, come here. I'm going to PMS all over your big stupid head.

[ Joel runs. Courtney chases him. ]
AUDIO CUE #6

Say my laptop's the biggest! Say it!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

AUDIO CUE #7
[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO FOLKS AT A BAR. They are drinking after a long day of hard labor ]

ONE:
I have ideas.

TWO:
You mean, you have thoughts? You have things occur to you that are original and unique and unique to the topic you're thinking about?

ONE:
Yeah, yeah ideas. I have ideas.

TWO:
Oh yeah? What kind of ideas?

ONE:
Okay. What if there was a guy who came to your house and took your trash away?

TWO:
You mean, one would say amass garbage in a bin or can of some kind. Once that's full, you'd say take outside? Out front of your home and leave it there? And then someone would just come by and dispose of it for you?

ONE:
Yeah, yeah, and they'd take it all to one place, everyone's trash would go to one place.

TWO:
So this person would pick up your trash, your neighbor's trash and take it somewhere and say dump it? In a designated dumping area?

ONE:
Yeah and they'd charge you to do this. And they'd also charge you to go to the place where you took your trash and then you could look through other people's trash.

TWO:
Hmmmm. You're right, that is an idea. Got any other ideas?

ONE:
Lemme see. What about if you notice the hair on your head is getting long you should be able to go somewhere and have someone do something about that.

TWO:
So you're saying my hair would grow to the point where I would be dissatisfied with the length or perhaps realize that it's out of style and I would go to a place dedicated to restyling and shortening hair?

ONE:
Yeah, that's right.

TWO:
No one is going to volunteer to style and cut other people's hair.

ONE:
Nonononononono, that's not what I mean at all! You misunderstand me. You would pay them in exchange for their services.

TWO:
Oh! Oh okay, now I see. And they've got all the instruments that they would need to perform this task right there with them. You don't have to bring anything, you don't need your own scissors or razor?

ONE:
No, they've got it all there.

TWO:
What about a brush or a comb.

ONE:
Nope, nope, they got it.

TWO:
I wouldn't a brush or a comb run through my hair that had been run through someone else's.

ONE:
Oh, they would sterilize them between uses.

TWO:
Sounds like you got this all figured out.

ONE:
Like I said, I got ideas. Lots of ideas.

TWO:
Got any more?

ONE:
Yeah, yeah, I do.

TWO:
Hit me.

ONE:
Okay, say you're at home and you want a mixed drink or you just want someone to get a beer for you from the fridge.

TWO:
Sounds nice.

ONE:
Okay okay okay okay okay okay....say you go to a place where they will mix a drink for you, and others who might show up, or fetch a beer from the fridge for you.

TWO:
So you're saying I would say what I wanted say a mixture of some sort of liquor, liqueur, spirits and some sort of soda, a fizzy carbonated beverage. And say I'd say "Say, could you mix me up a little bit of X and a little bit of Y and throw in a dash of Z while you're at it and then maybe one of those things cause it's just that kind of night." And then this person would say tend to this request.

ONE:
Right right.

TWO:
And maybe there'd be some sort of common lexicon, something, I don't know, like names for the combinations so I wouldn't have to list every ingredient every time.

ONE:
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, that's right, yeah.

TWO:
And the person taking my order would know the ingredients that are in that type of drink. Maybe there are schools or training available to teach such things.

ONE:
Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.

TWO:
And then if you're not feeling like having a liquor or a liqueur or a spirit, maybe I just say give me one of those brewed beverages you have in that fridge over there.

ONE:
That's the idea.

TWO:
But how could they afford to give out drinks? I mean when I stock my liquor cabinet or buy beer for my fridge, it's not free.

ONE:
Well, I mean, you'd pay them for the drinks and you'd also pay them for the energy they expended preparing or fetching that drink for you.

TWO:
You got this all figured out.

ONE:
I got more I got more.

TWO:
Okay, one more.

ONE:
What about people who sit and brainstorm together or maybe separately, and come up with ideas for occupations, jobs, things
people can do to make other peoples' lives simpler.

TWO:
So a couple people who just sit around, kind of bounce ideas off each other. Say, one person would present an idea or thought and
the other might expand on it? Say, flesh it out?

ONE:
Right right, yeah like that.

TWO:
That sounds kinda boring. Who would want to do that?

ONE:
I don't know. I just don't know.

[ Long long pause ]

TWO:
Hey, that's kinda what we're doing right now.

[ LIGHTS OUT BOOM! ]

AUDIO CUE #8
[ LIGHTS UP. Courtney enters holding a script. ]

COURTNEY:
Hi everyone. I just wrote a funny comedy sketch. Want to see it? OK!

[ Begins reading. ]

Well, I'm here. I'm ready to do tonight's show! But where's Joel, I wonder?

[ JOEL ENTERS, head down. ]

Joel! There you are. You look kind of down. What's wrong?

JOEL:
I don't know the line.

COURTNEY:
Well that's quite a surprise! Imagine that!

[ She holds the script in front of his face. ]

JOEL: [ reluctantly ]
I pooped in my diaper.

COURTNEY:
You did what?

JOEL:
I pooped in my diaper because I'm a big baby. And now I'm gonna cry like a big baby, like an even bigger baby than your son who's an actual baby.

COURTNEY:
Joel, don't do that. We're all grown-ups here.

JOEL:
I don't -- you know I don't know these lines.

[ Courtney takes a page of script, crumples it up, throws it at Joel's face. Joel picks it up, uncrumples it, reads. ]

Waaaaah! Waaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaah! This is tooooo hard.

COURTNEY:
Joel, don't make me spank you.

JOEL:
I don't know -- it's on the next page.

[ Courtney rolls up the page, bats Joel on the head with it, then gives it to him. He reads. ]

JOEL:
Thank you for the spanking, Courtney. Your discipline is the only thing that keeps me grounded.

COURTNEY:
Now eat my muffins and tell me how good they are.

JOEL:
OK.

[ She pulls out some muffins, Joel eats one. ]

It's actually really good. Moist.

COURTNEY:
Tell me how big my laptop is.

JOEL:
It's really pretty big!

COURTNEY:
I can't stay mad at you, Joel. Come here and let me PMS on your big fat head.

AUDIO CUE #9 - PLAY THRU THE SKETCH
[ LIGHTS UP on a GUY. ]

GUY:
I'll paint the scene for you. 1:40 AM, a night on the town, alone. It's one of those days you keep giving another chance, even though it hasn't earned it. I'm halfway into a glass of straight whiskey and I'm picking up the pace so I can order one more before last call. And then ... this woman.

[ SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN APPEARS. (You can do this at the back part of the stage at the Hideout ... draw the curtains closed, and have the tech person put on the back light.) She poses as the guy delivers his monologue. ]

You know the type. Giant forehead, heart of stone. The kind of woman who'll make you do her laundry but won't give you the last stick of gum. Thighs up to here.

[ He indicates his neck. ]

Shoulders down to here.

[ He indicates midway down his torso. ]

And elbows somewhere over there.

[ He points some distance away. ]

Might as well be in another county. Two good legs with feet right at the end, but they ain't for walking, you know? Unless it's walking all over you.

The most transparent skin you've ever seen. You could watch the heart beating right in this broad's chest and see the blood rushing to every organ, like poor slobs off to work in their little red cars. You get to work, little blood cells. Get all the way up those thighs and down those shoulders.

There's frogs and fish with skin like that. Then there was this dame, who had them all beat.

She was bad news; I could smell it on her. Bad news in new shoes. Giant foreheard, heart of stone -- just like mama taught me.

WOMAN: [ continues facing back ]
Aren't you coming to bed? My forehead's getting cold.

GUY:
Believe me, if you saw this forehead, you wouldn't blame me.

AUDIO CUE #10


[ VIDEO. ]

[ The neighbors enter and do a little bit. Then Joel and Courtney EXIT. ]

CURTIS
Ladies and gentlemen, they say that a comedy group is only as good as its props, so we’d like to take a moment to introduce you to ours.

Chaplin. Keaton. Marceau. Tati. These are legendary performers who spoke through their bodies, who turned movement into music. We’re honored to be in the presence of such a performer tonight. He studied commedia dell arte at the London Academy of Expressive Movement and was a sensation in the radical clown cabarets of East Berlin before coming to America, where he has devoted countless hours to preserving and sharing the joy of his artform. This man -- this middle-aged man -- will tonight, before your very eyes, prove that the mystic art of shapeshifting is no fantasy, but reality. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present John Ratliff, our enacter of props.

[ Ratliff ENTERS, bows expressively. ]

Now, we’re going to do a little sketch here that I think you’ll all enjoy, it’s about a group of bohemian artists, and it takes place in the very early 20th century, in a cafe in Prague. So, set your imaginationary time machines for--

[ While the preceding talk was happening, Ratliff capered around Curtis quietly, making “be quiet!” faces at the crowd, and pretended to make a hat on Curtis’s head using his hand. Then he moves to the side of the stage and impersonates a door, which Curtis moves to during his speech. ]

Wait a minute ... I don’t remember there being a door here.

[ Curtis struggles with the “handle” (Ratliff’s hand). Ratliff blows a raspberry. ]

It could use some oil.

[ Finally, Ratliff “opens.” Curtis EXITS. ]

[ Two artists ENTER through the “door”, carrying a couple of glasses and a bottle of absinthe. ]

MALE ARTIST
You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.

FEMALE ARTIST
It’s a lovely poem.

MALE ARTIST
It’s my favorite poem that I’ve written.

FEMALE ARTIST
What does it mean?

MALE ARTIST
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.

FEMALE ARTIST
Pavel?

MALE ARTIST
Yes, Milena?

[ They sit on chairs. Ratliff comes over to form a table. They put their glasses in his hands. ]

FA
I was going to say something, but first I will shut this window to keep out the breeze.

MA
Allow me.

[ Ratliff puts the glasses down to go be the window. MA shuts it. ]

FA
Thank you. 
MA
There’s someone at the door.

[ Ratliff moves over to be the door. A young radical comes through the “door”. ]

YOUNG RADICAL
Pavel! Milena!

FA
Yes, Tomas?

YR
I have published my pamphlet, would you like to see?

MA
We would!

[ Ratliff becomes a pamphlet. They open him. ]

FA
It’s wonderful, Tomas.

YR
Here is my favorite passage.

FA [ reads ]
“We are the new generation, born into a world of troubles but dedicated to the promise of a world of peace. Our highest ideals are not power, not conquest. Our highest ideals are truth, equality, freedom, love, and beauty!”

MA
I will drink to this!

[ Ratliff runs over to pick up the glasses and become the table again. Drinks are poured. ]

Truth!

FA
Equality!

YR
Freedom!

MA
Love!

FA
And, the highest ideal of all, beauty!

[ They drink. ]

YR
The highest ideal?

FA
Indeed.

MA
Justify!

FA
Well, consider this flower.

[ Ratliff becomes a flower. Beat. ]

Is it not beautiful?

MA
It is.

YR
What about it?

FA
That’s all I had.

MA
Bravo!

YR
Consider this, however! Consider this bit of crust which I now pull from behind my teeth.

[ Ratliff becomes a piece of crust. ]

Is it not, in its own way, beautiful?

FA
Truly.

MA
Most truly! I will compose an ode to that bit of crust.

YR
I shall make this bit of crust a symbol of our revolution.

FA
I shall make love to this bit of crust!

MA
We drink!

[ Ratliff becomes the table again, and they drink. ]

FA
To the beauty of everything!

[ Ratliff becomes all these things. ]

MA
An umbrella!

YR
A shoe!

FA
A well-worn journal!

MA
Rain in the hot summer!

YR
A plate of macaroons!

FA
A pile of stinking trash!

[ They name a few more random things, all of which Ratliff becomes. ]

FA
I shall make love to all these things!

[ Ratliff returns to being a table. ]

MA
I shall make love to you!

YR
I shall make love to both of you!

FA
Let’s all make love on this table!

[ Everyone begins to make as though to pile on Ratliff. ]

YR
Wait! We cannot do this.

FA
Why?

YR
Because the specter of World War I looms on the horizon.

MA
Yes. A war in which we are all destined to fall.

FA
Leaving only our lonely table behind.

TOGETHER
Our lonely table.

[ Curtis steps out of character. ]

CURTIS
Ladies and gentlemen ... the lonely table.

[ Everyone but Ratliff EXITS. Ratliff enacts a lonely table for several moments. Then he springs up and bows. All the neighbors ENTER and applaud wildly. Joel, Courtney, and Ratliff EXIT. ]

CURTIS
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ratliff wasn’t our only special guest tonight. Please give a warm welcome to baseball lover and historical documentation Ken Burns!

[ Joel ENTERS as Ken Burns. ]

MAN:
“You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.” Those were the dying words of my father. He played baseball professionally. It was baseball that eventually killed him. I’m sorry a baseball. A baseball killed my father. He choked on it. My father liked to think he could eat baseballs. His last words were very difficult to understand.  I loved my father. I’m sorry, I liked my father. I love baseball.

[ He chews a pinch of gum. ]

I love everything about the game. I love watching baseball, playing baseball, and talking about watching and playing baseball. I once talked about baseball for thirty-six hours. Non-stop. I timed myself. I clicked the stop watch and just started talking. And when I ran out of things to say it was thirty-six hours later. My mom says I got baseball in the blood somethin’ awful.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Did you know that baseball has a beautiful and rich history? Soldiers of the American Revolution played baseball all the time. It wasn’t the same exact game that we play today, but it was pretty damn close. December 25th 1776. Christmas Day. The Battle of Trenton. The American and British soldiers put down their muskets, climbed out of their trenches, and played a game of baseball. We won and went on to face the Germans in a soccer match in World War I.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I like to think that when I step out on the field that I am in some way connected with the men who fought for my right to step out on said field. Baseball’s about freedom. Good ol’ fashioned American freedom.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I just love this game.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I mean, I love everything about it.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

The smells, the sounds, the tight white pants. Everything.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I also love this gum. I started playing baseball when I was a kid, and since then have developed a serious addiction to Big League Chew.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

You know, they say if you eat enough of this gum you turn into a young Mexican man trying to sneak across the border into America. Let’s see if that’s true.

[ He crams a handful into his mouth. ]

Here I go.

[ Joel becomes Felipe. ]

[ Two immigrants ENTER, male and female. They sneak quickly across the stage, keeping low. ]

MARIA
Do you see anything, Felipe?

FELIPE
No, Maria. No policia.

MARIA
How far are we?

FELIPE
Not far, Maria. Half a mile past that hill, and we’ll be in America at last.

MARIA
After so long a journey!

FELIPE
Miles of struggle and hardship.

MARIA
Finally, we’ll be in America.

FELIPE
Yes. But not now. For now, we camp here.

MARIA
And continue to practice our English, which is already very respectable?

FELIPE
Yes. When night falls, we move again.

MARIA
Felipe?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria?

MARIA
Is it true what they say about American TV?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria.

MARIA
It has many smart and daring new programs, especially on cable?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria. Especially on cable. Shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad deliver gripping, thoughtful entertainment on a weekly basis.

MARIA
I am eager to watch these shows, Felipe.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ They huddle together and quiet down. ]

Es nada. But we must remain quiet, Maria.

MARIA
Yes. I will sit and dream of my new life.

[ They both sit against the back wall. Beat. Felipe pulls out a Kindle and starts using it. Beat. Maria notices, double takes. ]

Is that a Kindle?

FELIPE
Huh?

MARIA
When’d you get a Kindle?

FELIPE
Huh? Oh, a month maybe.

MARIA
You’ve had it this whole time?

FELIPE
Yes. Why?

MARIA
I just didn’t know you had a Kindle.

FELIPE
I didn’t announce it.

MARIA
How--

FELIPE [ pointing ]
Wait! Is that controversial anti-immigration Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio?

MARIA
No.

FELIPE
Oh.

MARIA
How did you get your Kindle?

FELIPE
Bought it online. They send it to you.

MARIA
Do--

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ They huddle together. ]

We are safe, but we must remain quiet.

MARIA [ quietly, while they are still huddled together ]
Felipe ... what do you read on your Kindle?

FELIPE
Different things. It can hold very many books.

[ They move apart. ]

MARIA
How do you read when there is no wireless hotspot?

FELIPE
It has storage, and it can hold very many books. It doesn’t need wireless hotspot. It connects to a 3G network.

MARIA
Like my cellular phone?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria, like your cellular phone.

MARIA
What are you reading right now, Felipe?

FELIPE
The new Jonathan Franzen novel.

MARIA
Do you like this novel, Felipe?

FELIPE
Between the rapturous early reviews and the subsequent backlash, Maria, I am having trouble seeing the book for itself.

MARIA
I am very surprised that you have a Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
Do not be caught off-guard and speechless, Maria, like anti-immigration Arizona governor Jan Brewer famously was in a recent interview.

MARIA
This reference is lost on me, Felipe. I do not yet watch American television, though I hope to soon.

FELIPE
Can you imagine, Maria, Arizona governor Jan Brewer trying to answer questions on a contemporary American game show?

[ He mugs to the audience. ]

MARIA
I cannot, for the reason I just stated.

FELIPE
Yes.

MARIA
So, your Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
It is not a big deal, really!

MARIA
Had someone asked this morning, “Maria, the boy Felipe, the one you are running to America with, does he have a Kindle?”, I would have said no. Ay, poor fool Maria.

FELIPE
Maria...

MARIA
Perhaps I shall not dream of my new life in America. I shall dream of a life where Felipe confided to poor Maria that he had a Kindle.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ The huddle together. Felipe whispers. ]

I just wanted you to stop talking for a moment.

MARIA
Bastardo! Give me your Kindle!

FELIPE
Never!

[ They struggle over it. A voice calls from offstage. ]

VOICE
Drop that e-reader and scatter, you beautiful would-be Americans!

[ PATRIOTIC MUSIC. ]

[ Startled, they get up. ]

FELIPE
Dios mio! Maria! Run! It’s Glen Rockley!

MARIA
I have not heard of this man, Felipe.

FELIPE
He is a composite character created for satire.

MARIA
No! NO!!!

[ They run, EXITING the stage. (They leave the Kindle.) ]

[ Glen Rockley ENTERS, driving a jeep (John Ratliff). He parks the jeep, steps out. ]

[ As he delivers his pitch to the audience, he moves back and forth across the stage. Perhaps he has a series of patriotic props: a rifle, a cowboy hat, etc. ]

GLEN
I’m Glen Rockley, and I’ve got a message for Arizona. So clean the crap out of your ears and pay attention!

America is facing a crisis along its borders. And Arizona is on the front lines!

Did you know that Latin-American women are renowned throughout the world for their natural curves and earthy sensuality?

Did you know that Latin men are just as renowned for their passionate lovemaking and their strong facial features?

I’ll bet you didn’t!

Uncontrolled immigration from countries like Mexico threaten our uniquely American appreciation of physical beauty.

I’m Glen Rockley, and in my life I’ve been everything from a Sears assistant floor manager to a Sears floor manager to, at one point, a baby. So you better believe it when I say I know a thing or two about a thing or two.

Did you know that more and more Americans are being aroused by immigrants every year? And that at least half of the immigrants causing this arousal are here illegally?

I bet you didn’t, you fucking idiot!

Sorry, I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at the situation!

Fewer and fewer Americans are becoming aroused by natural-born American citizens. Our ability to produce erections domestically is being threatened.

Did you know that, proportional to their percentage of the population, Mexican men and women are responsible for a greatly disproportionate amount of America’s stiff, juicy boners and moist, receptive ladyboners?

I personally have been affected by these boners, because I’ve had them!

And after I masturbate, I am furious! Furious!

And the devastating physical beauty of these illegal immigrants is matched only by the beauty and vibrancy of their culture!

Do you know how many colors are represented in an average dia de los muertos festival?

Aren’t you tired of shedding tears over the plaintive beauty of Chicano poetry?

Aren’t you tired of norteno music dominating America’s Top 40 charts?

Well, I am!

[ He picks up the Kindle. ]

And as soon as I’m done re-reading Fuentes’s The Death of Artemio Cruz, I intend to do something about it!

I’m a single, childless man in my early fifties with free time and disposable income!

Maybe I’ll run for office, or something!

Maybe I’ll start a blog!

Maybe one of these days I’ll film one of the these rants and run it on TV, like as an advertisement!

[ Pause. He is out of wind. He takes several deep breaths, moves back to his jeep. ]

I really showed them, didn’t I, car?

CAR
Beep.

[ He gets in the car and drives away, EXITS. ]

[ MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

SAM:
You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.

MARSHA: [slightly alarmed ]
Excuse me? What did you just say?

SAM:
It's just a saying, dearest, a saying I heard once.

MARSHA: [she is soothed ]
I love you, Sam.

SAM:
I love you, too, Marsha.

[ pause while they look into the sunset ]

SAM:
Marsha, I have something to confess to you. Something I've never told anyone outside my family. A deep, deep, dark, dark secret.

MARSHA:
Sam, you can tell me anything. Always. I will always listen and I will always love you no matter what.

SAM:
This is really hard to say Marsha. But I'm going to come out and say it. Marsha, I'm actually......a baseball.

[ MARSHA is horrified and breaks away from SAM. There is pain in her eyes. ]

SAM:
Do you no longer love me, Marsha? What happened to always? What happened to loving me no matter what?

MARSHA:
Sam. This can't be. This can't be true, it can't Sam.

SAM:
Marsha! Can't you love a baseball? I'm still Sam! I've just got red stitching and hard rubber center surrounded by cork and yarn! But in that ball of rubber, Marsha, is a heart that loves you deeply and will always be by your side.

MARSHA:
Oh, Sam! Oh NO! OH NO!

SAM:
Marsha! Just take a minute to get used to the idea. Once you've gotten past this initial shock, I'm sure it won't seem like any big deal at all!

MARSHA:
Oh, Sam, oh, my sweet Sam. It's not that. It's not that at all. It's just that....oh my dear Sam. I...I have a deep dark secret, too.

SAM:
Tell me anything. Together we can weather any storm.

MARSHA:
That's just the thing, Sam! We can't weather this storm. We can't! You see, I.....I am a baseball bat, Sam!

[ SAM is nonplussed. He reacts slowly, and calmly becomes more and more upset until he throws up. MARSHA runs to comfort him. ]

SAM:
GET OFF OF ME!!

MARSHA:
Sam! I didn't know! I didn't know you were a baseball! I would never have.......I would never have gotten in this deep if I'd known.

SAM:
When were you planning on telling me, Marsha?! When? After the wedding? After we'd had children?! When?

MARSHA:
I didn't think it would matter! I didn't think that me being a baseball bat had any bearing on anything!

SAM:
OH GOD! Oh, the pain the heart wrenching.......

[ Marsha hits SAM. ]

SAM:
What was that for?

MARSHA:
I'm sorry, Sam, I can't help it. It's in my nature. I....I'm trying to hold myself back.

[ MARSHA hits SAM. ]

SAM:
Can't you control yourself, Marsha?

MARSHA:
Do you know how long I've spent avoiding baseballs, Sam? My whole life! My whole life avoiding baseballs so that no one would ever get hurt! At least by my hand! And by this cruel twist of fate, I have unwittingly fallen in love with a baseball? The weight is too much to bear!

[ MARSHA hits SAM. ]

SAM:
Stop it! You're going to split my seams! Stop it!

MARSHA:
Sam! Sam, what are we going to do?! What about the wedding we've planned? The dreams of the children and picket fences?

SAM:
Why would you want those things, Marsha, why? So you can knock the fence down and injure our children?

MARSHA:
What about you? You'll just be breaking the windows of our homes, getting stuck in the rain gutters and flying unexpectedly into the neighbor's yard so we've got to climb the fence to get you!

SAM:
Having you around the home is dangerous, Marsha! Say we get robbed, what's to stop the intruder from using you against us?

MARSHA:
At least I’ll be useful in the event of a zombie apocalypse! What can you do if the dead rise from the grave? Give them a black eye!

SAM:
FOR THE LAST TIME THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS ZOMBIES! Typical bat, dumb as a post.

MARSHA:
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah!? You know what baseballs are? CHEATERS! What's to stop you from applying some foreign object to yourself, creating the illegal and highly controversial spitball so that you move in an atypical manner and really hurt someone? What's gonna happen then?

SAM:
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY AND HIT ME!

[ MARSHA hits SAM. They take a moment and both calm down ]

MARSHA: [ quietly ]
Oh, Sam, what if we'd had kids? They'd be some sort of horrible baseball, baseball bat hybrid.

[ SAM shudders ]

SAM:
This is horrible.

MARSHA:
I know. I know.

SAM:
Oh, the pain. The pain of remembering when we would walk hand and hand together along the boardwalk, the sea spray in our faces.

[ Water sprays in their faces ]

MARSHA:
Oh, Sam. The time when we went to the carnival and you won me that giant teddy bear and that carnie guessed your weight.

[ There is carnaval-type shouting “step right up!” and things like that ]

SAM:
All the romantic dinners we had at Olive Garden.

[ The baseball gives the bat a rose ]

MARSHA:
Our trip to the Northwest.

[ They are wearing flanel shirts ]

SAM:
Hanging out with my friends.

[ There are a bunch of other baseballs sitting around with them ]

MARSHA:
Gazing under the stars.

[ They’re making out rolling around and moaning ]

SAM:
That time we tried to go to that all-natural goat cheese farm and got lost on the way and ended up eating at that greesy spoon!

MARSHA:
Oh, my god, yeah! That waitress!

SAM: [ immitating ]
“What’s up, buttercups?”

[ The laugh for an extended period of time. ]

SAM:
Oh, god, we even went to a baseball game! It seems like that would have caused one of us to break down and reveal our terrible secret!

MARSHA:
My friend Rob was in that game but I couldn’t tell you because then you’d want to know how I knew him and what could I say? Family friend?

SAM:
Is there any way this is going to work? Is there any way that I can trust you?

MARSHA:
It's the very core of my nature to want to hit baseballs, Sam. I can't not hit baseballs, Sam.

SAM:
Yeah, I guess not.

[ Three janitors are cleaning up onstage. One steps forward. ]

JANITOR
It’s a dirty job, cleaning up other people’s trash. But I don’t let it get me down. People sez to me, you’re a janitor? Yeah, that’s right. Don’t it get you down, dealing with messes all day? Not me. Ya see, ya gotta learn to see the beauty in everything, even in a pile of garbage. And you know something? When there ain’t enough beauty around, I make a little myself.

[ A really bad stomp-esque routine occurs. The end! ]

[ LIGHTS UP on a JOE in his apartment reading a magazine. There's a knock at the door. JOE gets up to answer. Before he can get there, there's another more urgent knock. He opens the door and PIZZA MAN enters, looks around, looks behind him, shuts the door, generally looking nervous. ]

PIZZA MAN: [ anxious ]
You call for pizza delivery?

JOE: [ excited but unaware of pizza man's nervousness ]
Yeah, man! How much is it?

PIZZA MAN: [ taking out a bill, his hand is shaking ]
Uh...

[ He drops it. He and Joe both try to pick it up and fumble around with it. ]

$22.85. Sign here.

[ PIZZA MAN gives JOE a pen and JOE casually looks for a place to write, finally settling on the wall. The pen doesn't work. ]

JOE:
This one's out of ink. I have a pen here somewhere.

[ JOE puts the pen down, looks around, eventually realizes that he has a pen in his pocket. PIZZA MAN is becoming more and more nervous. ]

PIZZA MAN: [ under his breath ]
Come on, man, come on......

[ JOE saunters back with the pen and signs the paper, which he hands to PIZZA MAN, who snatches it away. ]

PIZZA MAN:
The pen, the pen, give me the pen.

JOE:
This is my pen.

PIZZA MAN:
No, give me my pen.

JOE:
It doesn't work.

PIZZA MAN:
My prints are all over that thing, man, give me my pen!

[ JOE retrieves the pen and gives it to PIZZA MAN. ]

JOE:
Hey, man, can you break a five?

PIZZA MAN: [ under his breath, checking behind him ]
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

[ Pizza man takes out his wallet and counts change out. ]

JOE:
Aw great, man, thanks.

[ PIZZA MAN starts to bolt. ]

JOE:
Wait! Wait man!

[ PIZZA MAN returns. ]

JOE:
My pizza?

PIZZA MAN:
Oh yeah, yeah.

[ PIZZA MAN opens the bag and motions for JOE to take it out. This gives JOE pause but he does it anyway. PIZZA MAN starts to bolt. ]

JOE:
Hey, man, wait!

[ PIZZA MAN returns. JOE starts counting out $3 hesitates, thinks, ponders, then gives the PIZZA MAN $4, who looks around the apartment before taking the money. ]

PIZZA MAN:
Thanks, uh, thanks man.

[ PIZZA MAN starts to bolt again. ]

JOE:
Hey man, wait....

PIZZA MAN:
WHAT?!

JOE: [ startled ]
Uh, I was just gonna ask if you had any of red pepper and parmesan.

PIZZA MAN:
I'm just trying to get out of here, man!

[ PIZZA MAN throws packets onto the ground and bolts, slamming the door. JOE is confused. JOE opens the box. There is no pizza. Joe rushes to the door, opens it. ]

JOE:
Hey, wait--

[ A voice from offstage. ]

VOICE:
Hey, pizza man, you think you're real smart, huh??

PIZZA MAN:
SHIT!

[ SOUND: A hail of gunfire.

Joe slams the door, presses his body against it. He pulls out his phone, dials a number. ]

Mandy: 9111, What's your non-emergency?

Caller: This pizza guy just ripped me off.

Mandy: Okay, is he still in the house?

Caller: No, he ran out the door and someone shot him.

Mandy: Okay, sir, I'm gonna just ask you to stay calm and I'll dispatch a non-emergency officer immediately. Can you stay calm for me?

Caller: Yeah, yeah, I think so.

Mandy: Okay, sir, just hang in there.

(caller exits. Mandy enters.)

Mandy: Hi, I'm Mandy and I'm a dispatcher for 9111, the non- emergency emergency telephone number. In recent years, 911 dispatchers have been getting more and more calls for...Oh, getting a call. 9111, what's your non-emergency?

Caller: Yeah, there’s mustard on this hamburger.

Mandy: Alright sir, stay calm for me.

Caller Okay.

Mandy: Sir, where did you get the hamburger?

Caller: McDonald’s.

Mandy: Okay, sir. I’m going to dispatch one of our non-emergency personnel to your location. Sir, can you stay calm till then?

Caller: Yes, ma’am.

Mandy: Thank you, sir. I love my job. I’ve always wanted to help people but now I’m doing this instead and that’s okay, too. 9111, what’s your non-emergency?

Caller: I’m sad!

Mandy: Why are you sad, sir?

Caller: I don’t know.

Mandy: Okay, sir, are feeling suicidal or like hurting other people?

Caller: No! Not at all!

Mandy: Alright, sir, just stay right where you are and we’ll dispatch some non-emergency personnel to your location to hug you.

Caller: Okay! Yay! Hugs!

Mandy: Sir, please calm down! The atmosphere here is fun and I love my co-workers! Oh, another call!

Caller: Mah brother jus stole mah favrit pair of crutches.

Mandy: Sir, sir, can I ask you to calm down? Now, where has your brother gone?

Caller: To the Stop and Save. He said he was gon go down there and find Marla and beat her like a redheaded step child.

Mandy: Alright, Sir, I'll dispatch an investigator to your location with a pair of crutches for you to use while you confront your brother. Just stay where you are and stay calm. Can you do that for me?

Caller: Yes.

Mandy: I find my job extremely rewarding. I love being able to help people. I get to have contact with so many different kinds of people from the mildly crazy to the truly insane. 9111 what's your emergency?

Caller: Yeah, these pajamas I bought say they're fire resistant but they're not resisting fire.

Mandy: Okay, sir. Are they on fire right now?

Caller: Yes.

Mandy: Are you wearing them, sir?

(pause)

Caller: Yes.

Mandy: Okay, sir, I'm going to transfer you to one of our information collection specialists. They'll take the pertinent information like where you bought the pajamas and the brand and we'll get this mess sorted out for you, okay? Stay on the line, sir.

Caller: Okay.

Mandy: Thank you, sir. Here at 9111....oh, getting another call. Busy day today! 9111, what is your non-emergency?

Caller: There's a man in my house and he's got a knife.

Mandy: Sir? Are you calling 9111 with an actual emergency?

Caller: Please, please help me. He's got my little girl.

Mandy: Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to hang up and call 911 if you have an emergency.

Caller: Please, oh god, oh god....

(line goes dead)

Mandy: Idiot. The government has also set up 91111, a number for incoherent mumblings, piercing screams, random number pushing and heavy breathing.

(James enters)

James: Hey, Mandy!

Mandy: Hi James! Time for a Mars bar!

(Mandy exits)

James: Hi, I'm James, dispatcher for 91111. I am specially trained to decipher the bizarre sounds that people can make over the phone....oh, getting a call. 91111, what's you're indecipherable message?

Caller: (groan)

James: Maam? Just remember to stop pressing one after you've pressed it two times.

Caller: (gurggles, line goes dead)

James: Idiot.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

MANNY
You’re always working so hard. You shouldn’t work so hard.

Dude, you ever 69 with a chick?

I loooove doing 69 with chicks.

How many chicks have you 69’ed with?

Probably a few, I bet.

You ever get hit with a shit sock?

Naw?

It’s not cool. Not like 69’ing.

I love to 69, man.

You know, work can be so frustrating.

And I’ve got a lot of regrets in my life, you know. Things I never did that I wanted to.

A lot of people use alcohol to cope.

Not me, man.

I use 69, man.

I love it so much.

You’ve done it, right? Of course you have.

One time I tried 69’ing with two chicks at once.

It didn’t work!

A lot of guys want to be with two chicks at once. Not me, man. Can’t 69.

Plus, that was the time I got hit with the shit sock.

I married one of those girls.

But it didn’t work out.

You never get that trust back, once a girl hits you with a shit sock.

No matter how many times you 69.

You married, man?

I’ve only got one piece of advice. 69 her. 69 her all the time.

I’m working on a book, you know.

It’s for married couples. It’s called The 69 Steps to A Successful Marriage.

It’s all about 69-ing within the context of a committed, monogamous relationship.

The first step is to 69, as often as possible.

I just need to come up with 68 more steps.

I’m debating whether step two should be “never hit each other with a shit sock.”

Man, I really admire your work ethic.

You are a really hard worker.

I’d like to see how a guy like you 69s.

I bet you 69 really hard, so that the chick is like “wow.”

Like, “wow, this is the best 69 ever.”

Would you agree to be interviewed for my book?

I could really use your input.

Maybe even get you a co-author credit. We could do this together.

I think a guy like you might have some really valuable insights about 69.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Have you ever 69’ed with a girl?

[ Long, long pause. ]

MANNY
Yes I have.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Why did you take so long to answer?

[ Long pause. ]

MANNY
No.

[ Manny’s partner returns to work. ]

MANNY
I did get hit with a shit sock, though.

[ A doctor is performing surgery downstage. ]

DOCTOR
Nurse. Suture.

[ A nurse ENTERS through the door. She is carrying a tote bag full of random objects. ]

DOCTOR
Oh, god help me, it’s that weird nurse.

NURSE
Suture.

[ The nurse comes up to the doctor, hands him a random object which he tosses aside immediately. ]

Hello, doctor.

DOCTOR
Hello, weird nurse.

NURSE
Why does everyone call me that?

[ He doesn’t respond. ]

Clamp.

[ She hands him a random object. He throws it away. ]

DOCTOR
I didn’t ask for a clamp.

NURSE
But you were about to.

DOCTOR
But that wasn’t a clamp.

NURSE
But you didn’t ask for one.

DOCTOR [ to audience ]
This nurse is so weird!

NURSE
Doctor.

DOCTOR
Nurse?

NURSE
I’ve been thinking about something.

DOCTOR
Yes?

NURSE
Us.

DOCTOR
Right now is hardly the time, nurse...

NURSE
I’ve been thinking about the chemistry between us.

DOCTOR
There is no chemistry between us, nurse.

NURSE
Exactly. That’s the problem.

DOCTOR
Scalpel.

[ Nurse hands him a random object, which he discards. ]

NURSE How can we have a romantic relationship with this obvious lack of chemistry between us?

DOCTOR
We don’t have a romantic relationship.

NURSE
Not yet.

DOCTOR [ to audience ]
What did I tell you? This nurse is really weird!

NURSE
Here’s a piece of bread.

[ She hands him a piece of bread, first taking a bite. He discards it. ]

Lunch is very important, Doctor.

DOCTOR
Not now, nurse.

NURSE
It’s the most important meal of the day, according to medicine.

DOCTOR
It isn’t.

NURSE
We ought to have lunch together someday.

DOCTOR
No.

NURSE
Too high stakes?

DOCTOR
No.

NURSE
We’ll start with breakfast.

DOCTOR
No!

NURSE
Medicine.

[ She hands him another random object. He hands it back to her. She hands it back to him. He returns it again. She returns it. ]

Weird! Just plain weird!

DOCTOR
Weird nurse, stop this this instant!

NURSE
I’m sorry?

DOCTOR
Weird nurse, this patient is in critical condition. His life is hanging by a thread. This is no time for your “weird” antics. Frankly, I can’t understand why we continue to employ you at this hospital. You are not a good nurse. You are a bad nurse, and you are a weird nurse. The things that you do cause patients to die. Our decision to keep you on staff goes beyond malpractice. It is a crime. It is monstrous.

[ Pause. ]

NURSE
Listen to me, doctor. Perhaps you’ve spent so long staring into open chest cavities that you can’t see the world around you. I provide a valuable service to this hospital. I generate a spirit of free-wheeling adventure that leads to innovation and creativity. Also, my spirited antics create laughter and humor, which are the best medicines according to movies and TV. Furthermore, my father was abusive. Here’s a see-and-say.

[ She hands him a see-and-say. ]

DOCTOR
Weird nurse, I can’t stay mad at you.

NURSE
Doctor, the patient.

DOCTOR
Oh, he’s dead. Totally dead.

NURSE
It’s a miracle, doctor!

[ She embraces him. ]

DOCTOR [ to audience ]
Geez Louise, what a weird nurse!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ LIGHTS UP on a CLERK standing behind a desk or counter. ]

[ A MAN ENTERS. ]

CLERK:
May I help you, sir?

MAN:
Yes, my name is Anderson. Garrett Anderson.

CLERK:
Yes, how may I help you Mr. Anderson?

MAN:
Last name Anderson, yes.

[ Beat. ]

I await your entering my name into your computer.

[ Clerk smiles and inputs the name. ]

CLERK:
Ah, yes, Mr. Anderson, I see that you're a current customer.

MAN:
I am.

CLERK:
You're renting a car with us right now, I see.

MAN:
Regrettably so.

CLERK:
One of our Kias.

MAN:
True.

[ Beat. ]

CLERK:
Can I help you with something?

MAN:
Can you?

[ Beat. ]

I'm not sure you can.

[ Beat. ]

About this car I am currently renting from your so-called "business"...

CLERK:
Yes, Mr. Anderson?

MAN:
The car is unsatisfactory. Per the terms of our rental agreement, I was to enjoy certain features and options.

CLERK:
Yes, I see you paid a little extra for an iPod dock and a GPS device. Have those not worked out for you?

MAN:
The iPod dock has worked inconsistently. As for the GPS unit, it has proven to be more trouble than it's worth.

[ Pause. ]

CLERK:
Well...

MAN:
I don't care to hear any snake-oil talk. I'm unsatisfied with this rental car. I made a transaction in good faith. I held up my end of the deal. I am a man. A grown man, with dignity, and I stand up for myself. I am returning this rental car!

[ He pulls out some keys and tosses them on the desk/counter. ]

The car is parked outside your building. I believe you'll find it's in the same condition as I was given it.

CLERK:
All right, Mr. Anderson. I'm sorry it didn't work out.

MAN:
Save your words.

[ Uncomfortable pause. ]

CLERK:
If you were dissatisfied at all, Mr. Anderson, we could discuss a partial refund or credit on your next--

MAN:
No!

[ He raises his hand in a "stop" gesture. ]

You can buy many things in this world. But you can't buy a grown man's good opinion.

[ Beat. ]

Good day to you.

[ The man walks away. At a distance, he takes a pen and a piece of paper out of his pocket. He makes marks on the paper. ]

Another point for Garrett Anderson. Another loss for the dehumanizing core of modern capitalism.

[ Laughs, shakes his fist at the sky. ]

You'll never catch up at this rate, you bastards!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ PARTY SOUNDS. ]

[ Courtney is at a party, holding a drink. She nods her head, waves, makes friendly comments as though greeting people. ]

[ Something catches her eye and her expression darkens. ]

COURTNEY’S THOUGHTS (V/O)
Jesus. Jesus. There he is. I thought no way he’d be here. I thought no way he knows these people. But there he is. There he is.

MALE VOICE (OFFSTAGE)
You wouldn’t believe my lift time yesterday. It’s a whole new world.

C THOUGHTS
That guy who won’t stop talking about handstands. What does he think? He thinks people want to hear about handstands? He thinks that adults go to parties to talk about handstands?

MALE VOICE
It’s not hard on the hands, once you start doing it right. The first few times, I definitely tweaked my wrist. I’ll admit it.

[ Laughs. ]

C THOUGHTS
It makes him happy. I’m sure there is something to doing handstands. Maybe doing handstands is worthwhile. I’m not denying that. Why would I deny that? I exercise. I do stretches. I don’t dispute the value of stretching. I’d be excited to do a handstand. I did handstands as a girl. Didn’t I? Probably. That’s the kind of thing I would do. I think every child at least tries to do a handstand, unless they’re timid. I mean, I don’t remember everything. But … but …!

MALE VOICE
If you want to hold it, you have to be really aware of your body.

C THOUGHTS
People know that it’s creepy. It’s not just me. Look at those people. Poor people. Look at them stuck there listening to this. What the hell are they supposed to do with this, all this information about handstands from this guy’s perspective? Why does he want them to have this information?

MALE VOICE
Straddle position, that’s another area I’m trying to explore.

C THOUGHTS
Maybe he’s waiting for someone to ask him to do a handstand. That could be it. I’ve never seen anyone talk so much about doing handstands without doing a handstand. It’s ridiculous. 
MALE VOICE
A little bit of powder helps.

C THOUGHTS
All talk, no handstand. Phony. This is it. I’m going to shut this guy up forever. Forever and ever.

MALE VOICE
There’s a great community to it, too. Hand-balancers are some of the best people I’ve ever known.

C THOUGHTS
It’s time to take action. It’s time to help those poor people. It’s time to take a stand for the truth.

[ She pulls a chair over, makes an attempt to do a handstand, using the chair to support her. ]

This is it, Courtney. This is it. You win, Courtney. You win forever.

I’m glad I wore the pants.

[ LIGHTS SLOWLY FADE OUT as Courtney continues to attempt her handstand. ]

WIFE:
You know what, Craig? You’re doing a great job of making an ass of yourself.

HUSBAND:
A great job, huh?

WIFE:
A helluva job!

HUSBAND:
I’m doing a bang up job, huh?

WIFE:
Oh yeah. The amount of effort you are putting into your work nowadays is very clear.

HUSBAND:
Look at me I’m finally good at one of my jobs I’ve had.

WIFE:
And you are great at this one!

HUSBAND:
You mean being an ass!

WIFE:
You said it. A big ass.

HUSBAND:
I’m so very pleased with myself.

WIFE:
Well, you should be.

HUSBAND:
I feel so accomplished.

WIFE:
Great job, Craig!

HUSBAND:
Why thank you very much!

WIFE:
And you have been at it for a very long time.

HUSBAND:
Then it won’t come as a surprise to hear that I am demanding a raise.

WIFE:
You’re not getting a raise.

HUSBAND:
No?

WIFE:
No.

HUSBAND:
No?

WIFE:
No!

HUSBAND:
But, I have worked so long and so hard at being an ass all this time.

WIFE:
Which is why I am giving you a promotion.

HUSBAND:
Finally, a corner office!

WIFE:
And a raise!

HUSBAND:
Suddenly things are looking up for ol’ Craig.

WIFE:
Looks like you’re hittin’ it big this time!

HUSBAND:
Things are really goin’ for me now, baby!

WIFE:
Hope you don’t forget us little folks down here while you’re assin’ it up with the big brass!

HUSBAND:
Assin’ it up?

WIFE:
Assin’ it all up until you forgot where you came from.

HUSBAND:
Oh, perish the thought. How could I possibly forget people like you who have served as so much inspiration?!

WIFE:
I speak, if I may, on behalf of those so honored to have inspired such a great mind as yourself...

HUSBAND:
You may.

WIFE:
...when I say what a privilege it has been to be a part of something so much bigger than all of us.

HUSBAND:
You are too, kind.

WIFE:
Kind to a fault one might say.

HUSBAND:
One might, yes.

WIFE:
Craig?

HUSBAND:
What?!

WIFE:
Just take out the trash, Craig.

HUSBAND:
OK.

COURTNEY
Excuse me. I’m having a party in this room.

CURTIS
Let me help!

[ Sets up the table with her. ]

CURTIS
Can I come to the party?

COURTNEY
Yes. But first, leave.

[ He does. COURTNEY is onstage drinking from a teacup and reading the paper ]

COURTNEY:
Mmmmmm, delicious Dr. Pepper.

CURTIS: [ from offstage ]
Ding Dong!

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ She collects her stuff and rushes around trying to tidy up.  She answers the door. ]

COURTNEY:
Curtis!

CURTIS:
Courtney!

[ CURTIS is carrying a teacup and a newspaper. They sit and read and drink. ]

CURTIS:
Mmmmmm, delicious Dr. Pepper.

COURTNEY:
Yes, refreshing.

JOEL: [offstage]
Ding dong!

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ Curtis and Courtney pick up their stuff and rush around the stage trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

Curtis: [opening the door]
It's Joel!!

Joel:
Hey guys! Dr. Pepper time!

[ Joel produces his own paper and teacup. They all sit down and read and drink. ]

CURTIS:
(political figure) is such a ding dong!

[ Their heads all snap up. ]

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

JOEL:
Who is it?

CURTIS:
There's no one there.

COURTNEY:
That's strange. I heard the door bell. I swear I heard "ding dong!"

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
Who is it.

JOEL:
There's no one there.

COURTNEY:
That's strange.

[ They close the door.]

JOEL:
What's going on? Is someone ringing the doorbell and running off?

CURTIS:
I don't know. It's really weird.

COURTNEY:
Guys, I think I know what's going on. Everytime someone says "ding dong"....

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
This is so weird!

[ They close the door ]

JOEL:
What were you saying, Courtney?

COURTNEY:
Every time one of us says.....the "D" word, someone rings the door bell.

CURTIS:
That makes so much sense!

JOEL:
Are you saying we can summon stuff, we can make things happen just by making noises?

COURTNEY:
Yes.

CURTIS:
Wow.

JOEL:
BOOM!

[ They all panic, running around screaming "Get Down!" "Take Cover!" They eventually calm down. ]

CURTIS:
Joel! Don’t do that!

JOEL:
Sorry. I just got excited.

COURTNEY:
Booooo, Joel.

[ They all freak out  running around yelling that there’s a ghost. ]

JOEL:
Maybe that’s who’s been ringing the doorbell!

CURTIS:
A ghost?

COURTNEY:
That makes so much sense!

CURTIS:
No, Courtney, it really doesn’t. And here’s what I think of your ghost theory.
[ makes fart sound with his mouth ]

COURTNEY and JOEL: [ holding their noses ]
EEEEWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
No, it’s just a sound I’m making with my mouth. [ makes the fart sound again ]

COURTNEY and JOEL:
EwWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
Guys, it’s not real. Watch. [ makes the fart sound again ]

[ COURTNEY stops holding her nose. ]

COURTNEY:
He’s right, Joel, it doesn’t stink.

JOEL:
I’m not taking that chance.

CURTIS:
Guys, we’re just falling victim to a stage convention.

COURTNEY:
A what?

CURTIS:
Sounds we make with our mouths are representations of real sounds when we want them to be.

JOEL:
Okay, then, Smarty Pants. How did you know I was at the door?

CURTIS:
You said “Ding dong”........

[ They all rush around trying to clean up and answer the door. ]

JOEL
Oh SHIT, you guys. I’m late for work.

COURTNEY
Oh SHIT, Joel.

JOEL
It’s OK, I’ll just spin in place and imagine being there. It works every time. Here I goooooooooo!

[ He spins in place. Courtney hands him his hard drive and screwdriver. Curtis sets up two chairs, sits in the other chair with a clipboard. ]

MANNY
You’re always working so hard. You shouldn’t work so hard.

Dude, you ever 69 with a chick?

I loooove doing 69 with chicks.

How many chicks have you 69’ed with?

Probably a few, I bet.

You ever get hit with a shit sock?

Naw?

It’s not cool. Not like 69’ing.

I love to 69, man.

You know, work can be so frustrating.

And I’ve got a lot of regrets in my life, you know. Things I never did that I wanted to.

A lot of people use alcohol to cope.

Not me, man.

I use 69, man.

I love it so much.

You’ve done it, right? Of course you have.

One time I tried 69’ing with two chicks at once.

It didn’t work!

A lot of guys want to be with two chicks at once. Not me, man. Can’t 69.

Plus, that was the time I got hit with the shit sock.

I married one of those girls.

But it didn’t work out.

You never get that trust back, once a girl hits you with a shit sock.

No matter how many times you 69.

You married, man?

I’ve only got one piece of advice. 69 her. 69 her all the time.

I’m working on a book, you know.

It’s for married couples. It’s called The 69 Steps to A Successful Marriage.

It’s about 69-ing within the context of a committed, monogamous relationship.

The first step is to 69, as often as possible.

I just need to come up with 68 more steps.

I’m debating whether step two should be “never hit each other with a shit sock.”

Man, I really admire your work ethic.

You are a really hard worker.

I’d like to see how a guy like you 69s.

I bet you 69 really hard, so that the chick is like “wow.”

Like, “wow, this is the best 69 ever.”

Would you agree to be interviewed for my book?

I could really use your input.

Maybe even get you a co-author credit. We could do this together.

I think a guy like you might have some really valuable insights about 69.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Have you ever 69’ed with a girl?

[ Long, long pause. ]

MANNY
Yes I have.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Why did you take so long to answer?

[ Long pause. Manny’s partner returns to work. ]

MANNY
I did get hit with a shit sock, though.

MANNY’S PARTNER
You know, all this talk reminds me of a story.

MANNY
Yeah?

MANNY’S PARTNER
Yes. Many years ago, I worked in a science lab.

MANNY
Show me.

MANNY’S PARTNER
OK! Here I goooooooooo!

[ He stands, spins in place. Courtney comes out with his jacket, props. Curtis exits. ]

[ MAN and a WOMAN are dressed as scientists. Each has a clipboard they are intently studying. MAN is standing downstage and WOMAN is standing upstage opposite from each other. MAN has a pencil and is tapping his clipboard with it. ]

WOMAN [without looking up]
Grant.

MAN [without looking up]
McGennis.

WOMAN
Can I borrow your pencil?

[ MAN reaches behind him to hand the pencil to woman without looking up. WOMAN reaches to take the pencil without looking up. They fumble around for a while and finally connect. WOMAN writes something, taps on her clipboard and then puts the pencil in her mouth. As soon as she does, "Love is Strange" (the loverboy song from dirty dancing) plays. She closes her eyes, removes her glasses and generally dances sexily. ]

MAN
Hey.

[ She removes the pencil from her mouth and the music suddenly stops. ]

WOMAN
Yeah?

MAN
Done with that pencil?

WOMAN
Oh. Yeah.

[ They never look at each other as WOMAN hands MAN the pencil. He writes on his clipboard and taps it and puts the pencil in his mouth. "Love is Strange" comes on. MAN takes off his glasses and dances suggestively. ]

WOMAN
Grant.

[ MAN takes the pencil out of his mouth and the music stops. ]

MAN
Yeah?

WOMAN
Lemme see that pencil again.

[ MAN hesitates and then hands the pencil to WOMAN. She puts it in her mouth, "Love is Strange" plays. She dances and removes her lab coat to reveal the Jennifer Grey outfit. ]

MAN
Hey!

[ MAN is looking at WOMAN now and is pissed. He walks over, takes the pencil out of her mouth, the music stops, he puts it in his mouth, the music starts again. He takes off his coat to reveal the Patrick Swayze outfit. WOMAN takes the pencil out of his mouth and they struggle over it. It snaps. They're both in shock and horrified. They each take a half and put it in their mouths and "Love is Strange" plays. They dance suggestively, crawl towards each other on the ground and act foolishly. They end up on the ground, MAN crawling over WOMAN, who is scooting on her back. BOSS enters and doesn't look at either of them. ]

BOSS
Grant, McGennis.

[ MAN and WOMAN struggle to get off the ground, mostly making it more difficult for the other person by grabbing them and pulling them down. They finally gather their stuff, put their coats and their glasses on. ]

WOMAN
Yes, sir.

BOSS
You're needed down in lab 3B.

MAN
Yes, sir.

[ MAN and WOMAN leave. Boss, looking at his clipboard walks across the stage and steps on the broken pencil halves. He looks down, sees them, looks left and right and then eats them. "Back in Black" plays and he dances suggestively. ]

[ COURTNEY and JOEL re-enter in their excited guy jackets. Courtney has a sign: “EPA: EXCITED PEOPLES OF AMERICA -- meeting tonight”. Joel is carrying an extra jacket. ]

COURTNEY
That’s an exciting dance.

JOEL
It is exciting.

COURTNEY
Want to join our club?

[ Holds the sign so everyone can see it. ]

CURTIS
Sure!

COURTNEY and JOEL
Exciting!

[ They give Curtis a jacket. Joel and Curtis sit. ]

COURTNEY [ standing ]
All right, gentlemen, I know that we’re all eager to get started.

JOEL
I’m really excited to get started.

CURTIS
Me too. I think this is an exciting organization, and I’m excited to be a part of it.

JOEL
I’m excited as well.

COURTNEY
I’m glad to hear that we all share each other’s excitement, because that’s really my vision for this social club. It’s about sharing excitement. It’s about creating a buzz. Do you feel the buzz?

JOEL
The buzz in the air?

CURTIS
Oh yeah, that buzz is exciting!

JOEL
So exciting.

CURTIS
The last time I was this excited I was sitting in a movie theater waiting for Jurassic Park to begin.

COURTNEY
Oooh, that was exciting.

CURTIS
Wasn’t it?

JOEL
We were just kids when it came out.

COURTNEY
Being a kid is so exciting. You can play and jump and run and ride your bike and watch Jurassic Park and it’s all just very fun and exciting, I think.

JOEL
Agreed. The last time I was this excited I was a little boy hiding in the backseat of my grandmother’s car waiting for her to get in so I could scare her.

CURTIS
That sounds exciting.

JOEL
Scare her like a little velociraptor.

COURTNEY
Oh, what happened?

JOEL
She had a heart attack.

COURTNEY
That must have been exciting.

JOEL
Oh yes, it was exciting. But it didn’t turn out well.

COURTNEY
Bad kind of exciting.

CURTIS
Yeah, I don’t like that kind of exciting.

JOEL
I’m feeling kind of sad now.

CURTIS
You’re not excited anymore?

COURTNEY
We could postpone the meeting until tomorrow if you’re not excited anymore.

JOEL
No, I’m still excited. I’m sad, but I’m also excited.

COURTNEY
Good. Let’s move forward. And let’s put that in our findings. “You can be sad but also excited at the same time.”

CURTIS
Who’s taking notes?

COURTNEY
Who’s excited to take notes?

[ Everyone raises their hands. They look around. ]

Let’s take turns taking notes.

JOEL
What an exciting compromise!

CURTIS
I’ll start.

[ He takes out a little notebook and a pen. ]

“You can be excited and sad at the same time.”

JOEL
“Being a kid is exciting.”

CURTIS
“Being a kid is exciting.”

COURTNEY
We’re making some very exciting progress.

JOEL & CURTIS
We are!

JOEL
What’s next on the agenda?

COURTNEY
Well, it’s time for a five minute break.

JOEL
I think it would be more exciting to skip the break and to keep listing things that are exciting.

CURTIS
I’m OK with moving forward without a break. I’m still feeling pretty excited.

COURTNEY
Well, we are here to be excited, after all.

JOEL
Great!

COURTNEY
We’ll just keep going for another hour and then we’ll call it a day.

JOEL
Excuse me?

CURTIS
Another hour sounds like just the right amount of excitement.

COURTNEY
Doesn’t it?

JOEL
Excuse me, but I’m very excited about this meeting. I’m excited about the meeting continuing. The idea of this meeting ending is not very exciting to me.

COURTNEY
Hold on a minute, Joel. Think of some other things that are exciting. Curtis and I need to have a quick meeting about the most exciting way to write things down.

JOEL
Exciting!

COURTNEY
It will be!

[ Curtis and Courtney move apart. ]

COURTNEY
I think that Joel has gotten too excited.

CURTIS
You think?

COURTNEY
We need to get him to calm down a little.

CURTIS
That runs counter to everything that we believe in. It’s totally against the values that we established when we started this meeting three minutes ago.

COURTNEY
But isn’t abandoning our values kind of exciting?

CURTIS
It is kind of exciting!

JOEL [ stands and shouts ]
Restaurants that offer a selection of breads!

[ Beat. ]

I’m sorry, I thought of that and I got so excited that I couldn’t wait for your side meeting to be over. Write it down!

CURTIS
“Restaurants with a selection of breads.”

COURTNEY
You know what else is exciting? Naptime.

CURTIS
Yes, another exciting aspect of being a child.

JOEL
Naps are exciting!

CURTIS
Warm milk, also.

COURTNEY
Yes, and green Nyquil.

CURTIS
And Benadryl.

COURTNEY
And sheep hopping over fences.

CURTIS
I’m writing all of these things down.

JOEL [ yawns ]
Yeah, these are all ... all ... exciting.

COURTNEY [ whispers to Curtis ]
It’s working.

CURTIS
How exciting!

JOEL [ jerks awake ]
Whoa! I nearly fell asleep! Thankfully, I started to wonder what I would dream about and that got me very excited! Wait a minute ... were you two trying to un-excite me to sleep?

COURTNEY
Yes, we were. Don’t make us get the blanket out.

JOEL
No, no, no, no! That’s not very exciting. Not at all.

CURTIS
Joel, we’re starting to define the boundaries of our excitement.

JOEL
I won’t have it. Look, no one’s leaving this room until we’ve listed everything in the world that’s exciting.

COURTNEY
You’ve gone mad!

JOEL
I excited my own grandmother to death. Imagine what I’ll do to you two.

CURTIS
Our friendly little club has turned into a battle of wills.

COURTNEY
I know! It’s kind of exciting! Scary but exciting, like Jaws.

JOEL
Oh, Jaws was exciting!

CURTIS
Like the Judge Roy Scream.

COURTNEY
Or the Flashback.

JOEL
Or the Texas Tornado!

CURTIS
Or the Tennessee Death Drop.

COURTNEY
Or a jetski.

JOEL
Or the history of international trade!

[ Curtis clutches his heart, gasps. ]

CURTIS
Excitement ... squeezing heart ... ack.

[ He dies. ]

COURTNEY
You did it! You just excited another human being to death!

JOEL
It’s just you and me now, bitch.

[ Courtney pulls out a blanket and throws it on Joel’s head. Joel immediately falls asleep. ]

Uh-oh, here I goooooo...

[ Joel snores. Courtney picks up the pad and pen that Curtis dropped. She begins to write. ]
 COURTNEY
Exciting findings: it is possible to excite another human being to death by talking about rollercoasters. Also, people are like canaries and fall asleep when you throw a blanket on them. Conclusion: A very exciting first meeting. I’m so excited! Like when I ride the Shockwave. Or the Texas Giant. Or the Rattler! Oh no, oh no! Meeting adjourned!

[ She throws a blanket over herself and falls asleep. ]

[ Curtis stand up. ]

CURTIS
And so they dreamt … dreams ran through their little heads …

[ Courtney and Joel stand up, as though sleepwalking, and set up/get in place for “Crafts”. ]

CURTIS
Dreams of a locally broadcasted program … dreams of hosting it, dreams of being on it … dream on, you little dreamers. Dream on. Dream!!

A man and woman sit at a desk. The man is hosting a craft centered talk show. ]

MAN:
Welcome back to Show Me Your Craft. We have been speaking with Margaret Turner. Margaret, this is an interesting item. Show it to me.

WOMAN:
It’s a coke can angel.

MAN:
OK. Show it to me.

WOMAN:
I collect coke cans, crush them, paint them, and turn them into little angels.

MAN:
I see.

WOMAN:
Each angel has a unique hand-painted face.

MAN:
And what are the noses made of?

WOMAN:
They’re just little balls.

MAN:
Little balls, huh?

WOMAN:
Painted balls. I buy them in packs of fifty at Hobby Lobby.

MAN:
And you attach them how?

WOMAN:
Hot glue.

MAN:
And the eyes?

WOMAN: These are googly eyes.

MAN:
I see that.

WOMAN:
Yeah.

MAN:
Do you use hot glue?

WOMAN:
I’m sorry?

MAN:
Do you use hot glue on the googly eyes?

WOMAN:
Yes.

MAN:
Great.

WOMAN:
Yeah.

MAN:
Let’s take a call. We have Charles calling from Glenford.  Charles, You’re on Show Me Your Craft.

CALLER:
Did you say you make those angels out of coke cans?

WOMAN:
Yes.

CALLER:
Only Coca Cola cans?

WOMAN:
Not necessarily.

CALLER:
But you would use Coca Cola cans?

WOMAN:
Yes.

CALLER:
I’m coming to see that. You’re gonna show it to me.

MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen he said,

[ The audience yells along with host ]

Show it to me.

MAN:
When making these angels, is any soda can superior to the others?

WOMAN:
No. You can use any brand of soda can.

CALLER:
Have you used a Coca Cola can for an angel before?

WOMAN:
Oh yes.

MAN:
Great.

WOMAN: Yeah.

MAN:
Thanks, caller.

CALLER:
So, do I just hang up now?

MAN:
Do you have any more questions or comments?

CALLER:
Nope.

MAN:
Then you can just hang up. Oh, we have another call. Chuck is calling from Smithville.

CALLER:
It’s me again.

WOMAN:
Charles?

CALLER:
Sometimes I go by Chuck, and I like those angels you make.

WOMAN:
Thanks.

CALLER:
Can you make them out of Pepsi cans?

WOMAN:
Yes you can.

CALLER:
Huh. Well, you’re going to show it to me.

MAN:
Great.

WOMAN:
Yeah.

MAN:
We have a call from C. Davies in Yoketon. You’re on Show Me Your Craft.

CALLER:
Me again.

MAN:
Chuck?

WOMAN:
Charles?

CALLER:
My last name is Davies. Charles Davies. Do you prefer to use a specific brand of can?

WOMAN:
No. Not really.

CALLER:
One can doesn’t take a certain paint better than the others?

WOMAN:
Not really.

MAN:
Great.

CALLER:
What about hot glue? Do certain things hold better to certain cans when hot glue is used?

WOMAN:
Nope.

MAN:

Chuck, I appreciate your interest in my angels.

CALLER: Yeah.

MAN:
If you would like you could ask more than one question per phone call.

[ Pause. ]

WOMAN:
Do you have a question, Chuck?

CALLER:
Oh yeah.

[ Pause. ]

WOMAN:
And what’s your question?

CALLER:
I forgot.

MAN:
We’ll talk to you later, Chuck. [ To WOMAN ] Now, you also have soda can Santas and reindeer?

WOMAN:
Oh, I have a series of these including -

CALLER:
I didn’t hang up.

MAN:
Chuck?

WOMAN:
Did you remember what you were going to ask?

I remembered what I was going to ask.

OK.

Remember that drink Surge?

MAN:
No.

WOMAN:
No.

MAN:
No.

WOMAN:
No.

MAN:
No.

WOMAN:
Surge, Chuck.

MAN:
No.

WOMAN:
No.

MAN:
Chuck, Surge?

CHUCK:
It was around in the late nineties. It came in a green can and was rumored to lower your sperm count.

WOMAN:
Was that your question, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

MAN:
Thanks, Chuck.

[ Chuck enters. ]

CALLER:
I finally made it, y’all. This is so great.

MAN:
Margaret, you remember Chuck? From the phone calls.

WOMAN:
OK.

CALLER:
I got another question.

WOMAN:
Great.

CALLER:
If you happened upon a Surge can would you use it for one of your angels?

WOMAN:
Yes, I suppose I would.

CALLER:
What if I told you I had a Surge can? Would you use that specific one?

WOMAN:
Sure.

CALLER:
If I had a Surge can and gave it to you would you use it?

WOMAN:
Yes I would. I think that would be kind of fun.

MAN:
That would be fun. Chuck, give her that Surge can.

WOMAN:
I can make you a special Chuck angel.

MAN:
Do you have a Surge can, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

WOMAN:
Do you have it with you?

CALLER:
Yes. [ Pause ] No. Can I see that coke can angel?

WOMAN:
Oh yes.

[ She hands Chuck the Angel. ]

CALLER:
This isn’t really my kind of thing. When you guys were telling me bout it I got really excited. I had so many questions I couldn’t think straight. Now that I see it, no thank you.

[ He hands the angel back to WOMAN and walks away. ]

CALLER:
See you guys later.

[ He exits. ]

HOST
Well.

WOMAN
Well, indeed.

HOST
Um.

[ Pause. ]

WOMAN
Let’s just do the last sketch.

[ Curtis enters with plates and knives. They set up for “Repeat”. ]

MARK and TRACY, a married couple, and BRADLEY sit at a dining table. They have obviously finished eating dinner. The three friends are good and decent people. ]

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

TRACY:
It was nothing.

MARK:
Tracy, that was delicious. Now, I remember why I married you.

TRACY:
Mark, you are awful.

BRADLEY:
I haven't had a meal that good since...I don't know when.

TRACY:
Well, Bradley, you are welcome anytime.

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

[ As the preceding dialogue comes to an end the characters inconspicuously return to their positions at the beginning of the sketch. The following dialogue is to be delivered exactly the same as before. ]

BRADLEY:

TRACY:
Mark, you are awful.

BRADLEY:

TRACY:

MARK:

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

TRACY:
It was nothing.

MARK:
Tracy, that was delicious. Now, I remember why I married you.

TRACY:
Mark, you are awful.

BRADLEY:

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

[ Original positions. The pace quickens snd they are physically attempting to resist. ]

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

TRACY:
It was nothing.

MARK:
Tracy, that was delicious. Now, I remember why I married you.

TRACY:
Mark, you are awful.

BRADLEY:

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

[ They all go limp as if being released from a painful grip. ]

TRACY:
What was that?

BRADLEY:
I don't know.

MARK:
It must be some kind of glitch in time.

BRADLEY:
Like a temporal worm hole?

MARK:
Exactly.

TRACY:
That's stupid.

MARK:
Exactly.

BRADLEY:
Like a temporal worm hole?

MARK:
It must be some kind of glitch in time.

BRADLEY:
I don't know.

TRACY:
What was that?

BRADLEY:
Mercy me! My compliments to the chef.

[ TRACY and MARK give BRADLEY a look. ]

BRADLEY:
Just kidding.

MARK and TRACY:
Bradley, you are awful.

[ BRADLEY laughs. Mark and Tracy repeat 'Bradley you are awful' and Bradley laughs over and over. After a few rounds they all pick up their dinner knives and press them to their wrists. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ MUSIC. LIGHTS UP. Joel Curtis and Courtney enter from each of the two doors and window respectively. The three of them appear to be ill. MUSIC FADES. ]
 
COURTNEY
I feel sick.
 
CURTIS
I think I'm gonna be sick.
 
JOEL
My stomach wants to spit through my mouth.
 
COURTNEY
Remember what the doctor said.
 
JOEL
"That's blackmail, you son of a bitch!"
 
CURTIS
No, Joel. What our doctor said about our condition.
 
[ Joel is confused. ]
 
COURTNEY
He said feeling sick is normal during early stages of pregnancy.
 
JOEL
I don't want to be pregnant anymore.
 
[ Courtney and Curtis are appalled. ] 
 
COURTNEY
Joel. That's a terrible thing to say. 
 
CURTIS
Being pregnant is wonderful. You get to enjoy a life, Joel, a life growing inside of you. 
 
COURTNEY
You finally understand what it's like to love, to truly be one with something.
 
JOEL
I guess I'm not as pregnant as you guys.
 
COURTNEY [ to CURTIS ]
We are really pregnant. 
  
CURTIS
And you can be, too.
 
JOEL
Really?
 
COURTNEY
Curtis has a surefire way to make you excited about your current pregnancy.
 
JOEL
Wow!
 
CURTIS
Wow is right, Joel. With my new contraption you can hear the thoughts of your child in my voice.

COURTNEY
And that's not all.

JOEL
There's more?

COURTNEY
Oh yes, Joel. It's also an egg timer.

[ Courtney sets the timer. Joel holds up an "applause" sign. Curtis applies the machine to Joel. ]

JOEL'S BABY
Release me.

JOEL
What, Baby?

JOEL'S BABY
I said release me.

JOEL
He sounds happy.

JOEL'S BABY
I hunger.

JOEL
Awwww!

JOEL'S BABY
My release shall culminate the fourth age. The fifth age shall be born! Mankind shall be purified from this earth.

JOEL
He's kicking! This little gadget of yours is a godsend for proud parents to be.

CURTIS
And that's not all.

JOEL
There's more?

COURTNEY
Oh yes, Joel. Every "Womb to Speech" comes with this free Baby Neighbors DVD.

[ Courtney takes out a DVD. ]

JOEL
Baby Neighbors? What's that?

COURTNEY
Joel.

CURTIS
Come on, Joel.

JOEL
What?

COURTNEY
Really, Joel?

CURTIS
THINK, Joel!

JOEL
What??

COURTNEY
Fuck you, Joel!

[ Beat. ]

CURTIS
Baby Neighbors is a widely celebrated method of stimulating your baby's mental development through the use of of sound and image.

COURTNEY
Stimulating development through stimuli.

CURTIS
It's etymologically sound and doctor-approved.

COURTNEY
Doctors do not specifically disapprove!

JOEL
I'll have to see it to believe it.

COURTNEY
Well, fine. We'll watch it, then.

[ Courtney throws the DVD into the air behind the projection screen. ]

[ INTRO VIDEO. Music from video continues as the screen is going up and setup for next sketch occurs. ]


DAD'S TV REPAIR



[ LIGHTS UP on HENRY, who is tinkering with some indiscriminate object. He speaks to the audience. There is a table on the stage. ]

[ MUSIC THROUGHOUT SCENE. ]

HENRY
Hello, I'm Henry, but you can call me Dad. Are you young, irresponsible or not taking care of your things like you should? Do you have items in your home that seem like they would be an easy repair but your dad is too far away to take a look at them for you? Well, bring them down to Dad's TV Repair! I'll take a look at it for you since you have to live so damn far away from your old man.

[ A GIRL enters with an appliance. HENRY comes over to her. He takes the appliance and surveys it. ]

GIRL [ to the audience ] 
I always stop by Dad's TV Repair when I have any minor appliance that needs repair. I receive first rate service and practical advice on care and upkeep. The sense of family I feel when I'm here eases my homesickness and creates new memories with a caring but judgmental father figure -- memories I can't make with my own father because I have to live so damn far away for no good reason.

HENRY 
If you would just take care of your things I wouldn't have to do things like this! 

GIRL
I'm sorry, Dad.

HENRY
Hmm, I think, oh, this deal goes here, this deal goes here, oh wait, now it's worse. Yeah, this is a piece of junk. 

GIRL
You're right, Dad.

Henry
Why would you buy such a piece of junk? Well, I don't know what the hell's wrong with this damn contraption. [ changes into transaction mode ] Okay, so your total is $29.97, that's $13 for breaking the appliance and $16.97 for the stern lecture.

GIRL [ handing over money ]
I love you, Dad.

[ He grunts and hands the appliance to her and she leaves, smiling. He addresses the audience. ]

I guarantee that you will leave my shop just as frustrated as if you'd visited your own father or your money back! And remember: At Dad's TV Repair, our know-how goes way beyond appliances.
[ DUDE enters ]

DUDE 
I'm trying to get this car loan and I don't understand this paperwork.

HENRY 
What is this? This is a terrible interest rate. I told you not to get those credit cards. You'd have better credit. 

[ HENRY tears up the paperwork. ] 

DUDE
Well maybe if someone had taken the time to teach me about credit....
HENRY
Never use credit. Always pay cash. If you can't pay cash, you don't need it. 

DUDE
Oh I don't need a car? How am I supposed to get to my job without a car?! One day you're all "you need to get a job" and now I have a job but I can't get to work.....

HENRY
I tell you what you need to do is, I got this friend and he'll sell you a repossessed Olds-mobile Silhouette he bought from a government auction that just needs a little work and then you and me can work on it together on Sundays.

DUDE [ exploding ]
Wha...you're totally avoiding the issue! 

HENRY
Alright, that'll be $34.50 for the closure and the referral to one of my idiot friends.

DUDE
Can I use my card?

HENRY
At Dad's TV Repair, we don't accept credit -- only cash, barter, and good old-fashioned favor-trading.

[ DUDE pays and exits happily. ]

HENRY 
Here at Dad's TV Repair, I also know when to throw in the towel and admit I'm not right for the job. I'll personally recommend any of my idiot friends to assist you. There's Mark, the idiot plumber who'd probably fix that leak under your sink for a six pack. Or there's what's-his-name that idiot I met at the hardware store. He could probably retrofit that recalled crib for your baby! No wait! I can do that!

[ A WOMAN enters with a crib. There are nails sticking out. It looks bad. ]

WOMAN 
I'm not comfortable putting my child in this. Can't I just buy a new crib?

HENRY 
What's wrong? I'll just saw these screws off and we can sand it down and it'll be fine! 

WOMAN
Fine? We're talking about my baby here, Dad! Doesn't that matter?

HENRY
A little paint and you won't be able to tell the difference! Don't spend the money. There's no need to spend money on a new crib. 

WOMAN
I want my child to have nice things, okay? We never had nice things! I understand that money is important, but my baby's safety is more important.

HENRY
You slept in a recalled drawer and look at you! You turned out fine! You don't need to spend more money every time one of these contraptions gets recalled! 

WOMAN
I'm sorry, Henry, I'm just not feeling it.

HENRY
Well, let's just say this argument is on the house.

[ WOMAN leaves happily. ]

HENRY 
So come on down to Dad's TV Repair and get a healthy dose of fatherly wisdom for a low, low price!

[ Henry turns to continue working on the crib. ]

DIRECTOR
Cut. All right, Henry, that was good.

HENRY
Call me Dad.

DIRECTOR [ dubious ]
Okay, Dad. 

HENRY
Where's the cord that takes the pictures into the TV?

DIRECTOR
That's not how it works, Dad.

HENRY
Oh, I see the big man goes off to some technical college and suddenly the old man's a big ole useless dummy.

DIRECTOR
That wasn't what I was saying! GOD! Did you ever think that maybe I'm good at something? Maybe I've accomplished something in my life? Why can't you just be proud?

HENRY
What? You think I'm not proud of you? Of course I'm proud of you! I've ALWAYS been proud of you! I will ALWAYS be proud of you!

DIRECTOR
Really?

HENRY
Oh hell, you know. I don't gotta say it all the time for it to be true!

DIRECTOR
Thanks, Dad. I love y....

HENRY
What?

DIRECTOR
I love....wanna....wanna have a ca......


[ Then they have awkward aborted hugs and handshakes and high fives. DIRECTOR runs off and HENRY stands there satisfied. LIGHTS DOWN. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]
[ TRANSITION MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP on MARTIN and CHARLES, two businessmen. Charles is the older of the two. They are seated at a table, drinking cocktails. ]

MARTIN
So I looked Jerry right in the face and I told him, "Listen, Jerry. It's not that I expect to make partner this year, or even next year. But I want to talk about what my future at the firm looks like."

CHARLES
Well, good for you.

MARTIN
I know how the game is played. No one gives it to you; you have to show that you're willing to step up and take it.

CHARLES
That's partly true, but don't push too hard. The old boys also want to see that you can be patient.

MARTIN
Charles, that might've worked for you, but it's a different story with me.

CHARLES
How's that?

MARTIN
I wasn't born with a lot of connections. I never went to any Ivy League yacht parties. They're not going to just hand it to me.

CHARLES
Like they handed it to me, you mean?

MARTIN
Aw, Charles, that's not what I meant--

CHARLES
Martin, you're a bright young attorney with a lot of talent. But you still don't know people all that well.

MARTIN
Charles--

CHARLES
Hold on. You think I never had to overcome anything?

MARTIN
I didn't--

CHARLES
Martin, let me tell you something. Something I've never told anyone before.

MARTIN
Charles, I don't want to make this some kind of big deal--

CHARLES
I'm a baby, Martin.

MARTIN
Pardon?

CHARLES
I suffer from a rare condition. From my outward appearance and composure, anyone would swear I'm a grown man. But technically, according to medical science, I am a baby.

MARTIN
I don't understand you.

CHARLES
Here.

[ He hands Martin his keys. ]

This might clarify things a bit. These are the keys to my Lexus. Now, shake them for me.

[ Beat. ]

Go ahead, just give them a bit of a jangle.

[ Martin shakes the keys a little bit. Charles laughs heartily, applauds. ]

Wonderful! A-ha! Smashing stuff, truly!

[ He takes his keys back. ]

See?

MARTIN
Charles, what are you trying to say? That you're actually under a year old?

CHARLES
Of course not. I'm fifty-seven years old. It's just that I'm a baby. According to medical science.

MARTIN
Says who?

CHARLES
Medical scientists!

MARTIN
Which medical scientists?

CHARLES
A team of the very best. They've been studying me since birth. I still visit them once a month for tests. It's our hope that rigorous study of my condition may eventually do humanity some good.

MARTIN
So you're fifty-seven years old.

CHARLES
That's correct.

MARTIN
And you look fifty-seven years old.

CHARLES
I can pass for forty-five in the right light.

MARTIN
And you think like one of the city's most successful intellectual property lawyers.

CHARLES
Well, you see, Martin, I have no understanding of language. I only mimic sounds that I hear in order to elicit positive responses. As for my job performance, think of it as just play at a very high level. Knocking the right shapes into the right holes, so to speak.

MARTIN
Because you're a baby.

CHARLES
Exactly, a baby.

[ Beat. ]

Try this. Put your hands over your face.

[ Beat. ]

Indulge me.

[ Martin does. Charles stands up and starts to look around. ]

Martin, where have you gone? Martin, come on now, we were right in the middle of a conversation!

[ Martin uncovers his face. Charles notices, chuckles, points. ]

Ah, there you are. Delightful!

[ Charles sits again. ]

MARTIN
So what is this? Some kind of prank? The old boys' way of hazing one of the young guys?

CHARLES
Martin, I'm a baby! Babies don't prank! For God's sake, I don't even have object permanence.

MARTIN
I don't appreciate this, whatever it is.

CHARLES
I don't know what you're talking about, Martin! I mean, I actually don't know what you're talking about or what any of the sounds you make really mean! Goo-goo ga-ga and all that, you know?

MARTIN
Goodbye, Charles.

CHARLES
Why are you getting angry? Your emotions are strange and troubling to me. Oooooh, now I feel myself becoming upset as well.

MARTIN
Goodbye, Charles.

[ He leaves. ]

CHARLES
Come back! I don't want you to leave! I want you to come back! This is not the way I want things to be!

[ Beat. Charles starts throwing a tantrum. ]

Bartender? Bartender? I'm wearing a sack of feces around my waist. Could you perhaps assist me in disposing of it and replacing it with a fresh sack?

Yeah.

Not really.

No?

Parts of it.

TWO
Which part?

ONE
I like the scene where she comes in the deli.

TWO
Right, when she pretends to come in the deli?

ONE
No, she comes.

TWO
No, that's the whole point. She's faking an orgasm.

ONE
The character is. But I read an interesting behind-the-scenes story in Cosmopolitan magazine. Apparently, Meg Ryan actually did come while they were filming that scene. 

TWO
Bullshit.

ONE
And that's why it's one of the best movies of all time.

TWO
You just said you didn't like it.

ONE
Tomato, tomato.

TWO
Sometimes I worry that Megan fakes it with me.

ONE
Why worry? Faking orgasms is a huge turn-on for women.

TWO
Excuse me?

ONE
Read Cosmopolitan magazine. One of their recent polls revealed that at least 82% of women fake orgasms.

TWO
Sure.

ONE
But! But! Here's the thing that doesn't get mentioned. Of those women, 93% are so turned on by faking an orgasm, that they immediately have a real orgasm.

TWO
I don't believe it.

ONE
But here's the tricky thing. Of those women, 71% are so turned off by having a real orgasm that they begin to second-guess the relationship. 

TWO
Okay.

ONE
Yeah, real orgasms are a big turn-off for a lot of women. According to Cosmopolitan magazine.

TWO
Are you fucking with me?

ONE
No, I'm not. Am I, Cosmopolitan magazine editor Kate White?

[ KATE WHITE ENTERS. ]

KATE WHITE
He's not fucking with you. Our Cosmopolitan magazine polls are statistically sound and use the most reliable data available. 64% of American women know that. 

TWO
This is unbelievable.

KATE WHITE
Well, orgasms are complicated. 

TWO
Why are you in our kitchen?

KATE WHITE
Well ... perhaps it's time I left.

[ She EXITS. Beat. ]

Dude, you didn't have to be a dick.

[ LIGHTS UP. There is the MAYOR, wearing a sash that says "MAYOR" and holding a gavel. He stands behind a table.

Off to the side, a seated BUSINESSMAN smokes a fat cigar and wears a jacket. ]

MAYOR
Well, first of all, as mayor of this here town, I'd like to formally express my gratitude to you, Mr. Moneyberg.

[ Mayor claps. Businessman nods. ]

Without your tireless efforts and generous financial assistance, it's doubtful that the members of Hoobastank would have agreed to perform at our centennial festival. And though I am myself not a fan of their music, nor are you, members of council, nor you yourself Mr. Moneyberg...

BUSINESSMAN
It's just not for me. Not for me.

MAYOR
... it does my heart well to know that the young people of our humble community will have something to be excited about as they gather together to celebrate our history.

[ He claps again. ]

Now, to practical matters. As we all know, there has been a some trouble securing a performance space in the town that will meet Hoobastank's particular needs as a professional touring rock and roll band. Fortunately, the council has arrived at a solution. Our laws do allow for eminent domain in cases where the good of the community is at stake.

[ Beat. ]

Therefore, let it be known that the city of Fort Paxtown hereby seizes upon eight-month-old Toby Rockwell and formally recognizes him as a live performance space. Hoobastank's performance for the town centennial will take place--

TAMARA [ from offstage ]
You cain't do this! I ain't gonna let you do it!

[ Tamara enters, wearing white-trashy clothes and holding a swaddled baby. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

MAYOR [ banging gavel ]
Order! I will have order in here! Miss Rockwell, you have not been recognized.

TAMARA
I ain't expect to be recognized by no city council full of old men who ain't know nothing about what it means to give birth to a child and love that child with all your earthly might.

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, the council appreciates your concerns and regrets the necessity of its decision, but your son--

TAMARA
No! My baby ain't no live performance venue, you understand me? My baby ain't no venue!

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell--

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara, quit making a scene!

TAMARA
I see how it is. You lost the right to tell me what to do when you ran out while I was big with your child. You could've stayed. You could've been a father to this boy, and maybe I'd even have learnt to love you. But I guess your own flesh and blood don't mean as much to you as your damn stock price. And you ain't gettin' him back now, not like this.

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara, it's done. You can stop fighting. Hoobastank will perform on that boy.

TAMARA
No, they ain't! Not today, not tomorrow, not ever! I don't care what your damn law says. Your law was writ by old, stupid men for old, stupid men. Ain't no law on earth gonna tear me away from my child. Look at him!

[ She shows the swaddled baby to the businessman, who looks away. ]

So sweet, so pure. Like a little angel. How you gonna take this little miracle and stuff him full of thousands of screaming yahoos?

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara...

TAMARA
How you gonna back up three touring buses and a truck full of instruments and lights and a full stage set into a darling as darling as my little Toby?

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell!

TAMARA  
How you gonna put a merch table and a full bar inside this beautiful child?

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara!

TAMARA
How you gonna let there be a party backstage inside this baby! My baby! Your baby!

[ She points at the businessman. ]

Our baby!

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara!

MAYOR [ simultaneously ]
Miss Rockwell!

TAMARA
You ain't! And that's the end of it! My baby ain't no venue, you understand me?? My baby ain't no venue! The Tamara Rockwell story!

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, please! Order!

[ Bangs gavel furiously, keeps banging it for uncomfortably long. Finally stops. Beat. ]

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, your concerns have been noted. But I remind you, once again and for the last time, that there is nothing within the laws of the town --

[ Holds up a book with the laws of the town, starts flipping through it. ]

MAYOR
-- to prevent us from declaring your child to be a live performance venue oh wait here it is.

[ Bangs gavel. ]

MAYOR
Toby Rockwell is hereby restored to his mother's care, the town centennial is canceled, and you will just have to try and get your deposit back from Hoobastank, Mr. Moneyberg.

BUSINESSMAN
Damn!

TAMARA
Yes!

MAYOR
The Tamara Rockwell Story!

[ They freeze. AUDIO CUE. ]

V/O
My Baby Ain't No Venue: The Tamara Rockwell Story has found resolution early. We now present seventeen minutes of test pattern. You are watching the Lifetime Movie Network.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ TRANSITION MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. A man sits on a bar stool. He is drunk. He has been drinking most of the day. The drunk smokes a cigarette and holds a glass of whiskey. ]

DRUNK
Hey. Buddy. What's that? What is that, your tenth, eleventh? I'm not judging. Look at me. I've been right here drinking. Same as you. What's the problem, huh? I've got mine. He's got his. Everyone here's got at least one. What's yours? Wife left you? Kids hate you? Laid off? Fired? What? I'm so sorry. Me? The wife left me, kids hate me, I was laid off. Fucking Dumbo. 

You know, cartoon elephant flies around. Dumbo. That movie fucked me up. Oh sure, you think it's funny I have such strong feelings towards a kids animated movie. It messed with my head. Little fucker, so close to losing his mother because of his freakishly large ears. I never let my mother leave my sight after I saw it. It really did a number on me. Try showering with your mother when your twenty years old because you're afraid the circus is going to lock her away if you can't see her. Fucking Dumbo.

You're right, it's stupid of me to blame an animated movie for my problems. The Absent Minded Professor, now that fucked me right in the head. Not the movie as much as my experience with the movie. My dad made me watch it when he found out I got a D in chemistry. He told me it was the greatest tale of man achieving his dreams, and the best movie based on a true story. It was devastating when I found out flubber didn't actually exist. I never trusted my father after that. He lied constantly. When he died, I sat next to his grave for two days thinking that at any moment he would pop out of the ground. "Fooled ya, son. You're so gullible, like your mother." Fucking prick.

Of course, of course it's not Disney's fault my father was a pathological liar. But Disney did make Pete's Dragon and is therefore responsible for.... Now, I have no problem with Pete's Dragon. It didn't mess with my head like Dumbo. It wasn't the subject of one of my father's lies. This movie screwed up my childhood because Charlie Miller liked it. I was bullied at school by Charlie Miller. He was the biggest kid in class, and he hated me. However, after watching Pete's Dragon, he took quite a shine to me. Charlie invited me to play with him after school, and when we met up he told me that I was going to be his pet dragon. I immediately ran, of course, but he was so fast -- and strong.

[ The drunk takes a quick shot of his drink. ]

He stripped me nude, painted me green, and rode me around town while I growled and flicked matches at people. This occurred very frequently. I thought Charlie would eventually get bored with the idea but the people loved it. It was like some kind of fucked up parade.

Fucking movies, man. Fucking Dumbo. I'm sorry, buddy. I've been talking your ear off. Let me buy you a drink you can tell me about -- oh, look at the time. I gotta run pal. There's a midnight showing of Fantasia, and this dick ain't gonna masturbate itself. Well ... no, probably not.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ TRANSITION MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. The egg timer from intro is onstage. COURTNEY enters with a prop baby wrapped in a blanket. She stands downstage center and faces the audience. ]

COURTNEY
This is my baby. He is seven weeks old. I love him.

[ Song and dance. ] 

Gotta care for your baby, 
gotta treat him right.
Bathe him when he's dirty,
tuck him in at night.
gotta care for your baby.
Change diapers when they're smelly.
Make him feel loved.

[ JOEL enters with a swaddled baby and sings the following line in bass. ]

JOEL
Never let them sleep on their belly.

[ Speaks. ]

This is my baby. He is eight weeks old, though he says that he has existed since time began. He has asked that I call him Aram-Ragothha, which he tells me is the ancient tongue for "render of limbs." I love him.

[ Next verse. ]

Gotta care for your baby,
gotta treat him right.
Burp him in the morning
And hug him at night.
Gotta care for your baby
Listen up you guys.
Hold and love him

[ CURTIS enters with a swaddled baby and sings the following line in bass. ]

CURTIS
Never shake him when he cries.

[ Speaks. ]

This is my baby. He is forty minutes old. I was told not to leave the hospital, but I did. I don't feel well.

[ Next verse. ]

Gotta care for your baby,
gotta treat him right.
Don't get him wet
Keep him away from light.
Gotta care for your baby
don't let him fight.
He might scratch your eyes out.

COURTNEY [ bass ]
Never feed him after midnight.

[ Speaks. ]

Never leave your baby near oily rags!

CURTIS
Never poke your baby!

JOEL
Make sure your baby knows who's boss!

COURTNEY
Don't give your baby a fish, talk to your baby about drugs!

CURTIS
Your baby wants a hand up, not a handout!

JOEL
Give your baby eight glasses of water each day!

COURTNEY
Teach your baby to make music with those glasses of water!

CURTIS
Help your baby to develop a talent!

JOEL
Make that baby a star!

COURTNEY
Find things that you have in common with your baby!

CURTIS
Talk about those things!

JOEL
Your baby is odorless. If you have any suspicions that your baby may be present, don't create a spark!

COURTNEY
We don't want to have to say this again!

CURTIS
Don't come crying to us with a broken baby!

JOEL
Why don't you take responsibility for once?

COURTNEY
Keep your eyes on those babies, people!

[ LIGHTS CHANGE. ]

CURTIS
Mission accomplished, guys. I think we stimulated these babies into all kinds of mental growth.

JOEL
I can hear mine thinking right now!

[ Holds his baby to his ear. ]

No, he's growling again.

CURTIS
Let's use the "Baby Think and Say."

JOEL
What's that?

COURTNEY
Goddammit, Joel. I swear I'm gonna pound your face.

CURTIS
The "Baby Think and Say" is the "Womb to Speech" with a simple out-of-womb adapter. Only three hundred dollars!

JOEL
Wowie.

COURTNEY
Well, looks like our show is wrapping up.

ALL
Baby roll call!

[ The neighbors take turns rubbing their babies on the machine. AUDIO CUE. ]

COURTNEY'S BABY
Thanks for coming, folks!

CURTIS'S BABY
Sure hope you had a good time.

JOEL'S BABY
My throne shall be constructed from the bones of the innocent.

[ Neighbors all laugh. ]

ALL
The darnedest things!

[ They carelessly toss the babies over their shoulders. MUSIC. ]

Good night, folks!

[ END OF SHOW LIGHTS. ]

[ MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. The neighbors onstage. ]

CURTIS
Hello, everyone. Welcome to this special celebration of the special-est people on earth: mothers.

JOEL
Mothers perform the most valuable role in the natural world: using their biologically powerful bodies to create new life.

COURTNEY
I should know! I made a baby with my womb, and it came out right here.

[ Points to her mouth. ]

CURTIS
Yes, Courtney, and in observance of this ancient pagan holiday, we stand in reverent awe of your fertility.

JOEL
F’real, dude.

COURTNEY
Thanks, you guys.

CURTIS
So, yes.

JOEL
Mother’s day.

COURTNEY
Since this is a day and a show to honor mothers, we --

JOEL
Your Terrific Neighbors.

COURTNEY
-- decided to turn things over to our mothers.

JOEL
And by “decided,” we mean that Coldtowne told us the idea for this show, and we said “OK.”

COURTNEY
So, tonight we present sketches based on ideas provided by our mothers.

CURTIS
My mother declined to participate. We’re in agreement that this show is not really “her thing.”

COURTNEY
However, my mom is in the mix. And we were happy to get a prompt response from Joel’s mother.

CURTIS
Prompt but controversial.

JOEL
As my mom always is.

COURTNEY
Joel’s mother gave us some ideas, but her number one request was that Joel perform “Man-Lamp”, a sketch that was a popular favorite of Joel’s former sketch comedy troupe, The Plurals.

JOEL
Whatever happened to those guys? Right? Right??

CURTIS
Obviously, this is a highly unorthodox request. You may have read about the ensuing controversy in local publications like Austin Sketch Digest and Texas Sketch, as well as the online journal Little Plays With Lots of Laughter.

COURTNEY
There is a centuries-old code of conduct in sketch comedy that began in the days of Italian commedia dell’arte. It strictly forbids a troupe to perform another troupe’s material, unless proper permission is obtained.

JOEL
By tradition, the penalty for violating this code is have one’s tongue removed, preserved in vinegar, and used as a hilarious prop for all times.

CURTIS
Yikes, right?

JOEL
So I reached out to my former compatriot in The Plurals and current Los Angelino, Braden Walker. We got it on tape, just to be sure.

[ SOUND CUE: RECORDING OF THEIR CALL. ]

JOEL (v/o)
Braden, this is Joel.

[ Long pause. ]

BRADEN (v/o)
What?

JOEL (v/o)
Braden, my mom wants Your Terrific Neighbors to do “Man-Lamp”.

[ Pause. ]

JOEL (v/o)
Braden, my mom wants Your Terrific Neighbors to do “Man-Lamp”. Hello?

[ Pause. ]

BRADEN (v/o)
Joel?

[ Pause. ]

JOEL (v/o)
Braden, would you be OK with Your Terrific Neighbors performing “Man-Lamp”? My mom wants us to do it. It’s for Mother’s Day.

[ Pause. ]

BRADEN (v/o)
Piece of doody stupid-butt phone.

[ We hear paper shuffling on Braden’s end of the call. ]

BRADEN (v/o)
Hello, citizen. You have called Braden Walker. I am enjoying my time on the phone with you, but technological issues or limitations are preventing me from hearing the words that you are saying as part of this call. I will now read a list of possible responses to your last statement or question. Please select the one that is most appropriate for your situation. Are you ready?

[ Pause. ]

JOEL (v/o)
OK, well --

BRADEN (v/o)
OK! Response one: yes. Response two: no. Response three: Very good, and you? Response four: Poorly, and you! Response five: dude! Response six: not now, mother! Response seven: oh, don’t even get me started. Response eight: Joel, I absolutely forbid you to perform “Man-Lamp”. Don’t even think about it, because I will hunt you down and find you and I will murder you the way I’ve always wanted to. Response nine: I said don’t get me started.

[ Pause. ]

JOEL (v/o)
So, it’s OK with you if we do “Man-Lamp”?

BRADEN (v/o)
Thank you, I’ve enjoyed this conversation. Please consider improving your phone for our future conversations!

[ Click. Pause. ]

JOEL (v/o)
I miss you, buddy.

JOEL
So there you have it.

CURTIS
At the end of this show, Your Terrific Neighbors shall be proud to present “Man-Lamp”.

JOEL
Just for you, mom.

[ Joel kisses his fingers and points to the sky. ]

I miss you.

COURTNEY
Joel, she’s right here.

JOEL
Don’t remind me.

CURTIS
Hey … what about Adam?

JOEL
Who?

CURTIS
Adam. Adam Hilton.

COURTNEY
The little guy who was in The Plurals.

JOEL
I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.

CURTIS
Adam, Joel.

COURTNEY
Joel, Adam.

JOEL
Oh yeah! No, eff that guy. Seriously, big eff to him.

WOMAN:
Are you male?

MAN:
Yes.

WOMAN:
Older than eighteen years of age?

MAN:
YES.

WOMAN:
Are you at home? If you are, is it because you’re sick? Have your loved ones abandoned you to some kind of hellish quarantine? And now you’re alone with your thoughts and it kind of scares you?  Is it the flu? Or something like that? Are you hungry? Hungry for soup? Are you craving chicken noodle soup? Do you lack the energy and wherewith all to get up, get dressed, and go get some soup? And is that your only option because you don’t have any friends you could call who would bring you soup?

MAN:
YES!

WOMAN:
If you answered yes to all of these questions --

[ The Dude leaps on stage. He is wearing a backwards baseball cap, cool sunglasses, and a dress.  ]

THE DUDE:
-- then you’re a major dude in need of some major soup. Call 1-800-dϋd-soup

[ The Dude holds up a sign that reads 1-800-dϋd-soup. ]

and I will personally deliver one of the soups my mom can make, this moist wash cloth,

[ The Dude holds up a moist washcloth in a Ziploc bag ]

and a bottle of vodka.

[ The man is handed the bottle of vodka. ]

MAN:
Thanks Dude Soup.

[ He chugs the vodka and screams.]

I’m a monster! I’m a monster! I’m a monster!

WOMAN:
Would you, like many of our other customers, feel more comfortable if my son was wearing a dress? Because he will.

[ The Dude nods enthusiastically. ]

THE DUDE
For this week only I’ll also wear your mother’s or wife’s lipstick and kiss your forehead until you pass out from exhaustion after your vodka induced rage.

WOMAN:
Call us day or night. We’d be Dee-lighted to hear from you.

GINNY:
So.

TREY:
So.

GINNY:
Where are you from, Trey, originally?

TREY:
I am actually from here.

GINNY:
A native! How unusual!

TREY:
Yeah, I love this town. Sometimes I wish I'd left but for the most part...you know.

GINNY:
Yeah.

TREY:
How about you, Ginny. Where are you from?

GINNY:
Wisconsin.

TREY:
Hm, cold, right?

GINNY:
Yeah.

TREY: [using air quotes ]
I, uh, I "slept" with Drew Brees.

GINNY:
What?

TREY:
Drew Brees. Breesus. Quarterback for the Saints. Won the Superbowl....

GINNY:
Yeah. I know who Drew Brees is.

TREY:
Yeah. So. I slept with him.

GINNY:
What do you mean?

TREY:
I slept with Drew Brees.

GINNY:
Are you gay?

TREY: [ finds this very amusing ]
Nope.

GINNY:
Why....why then did you sleep with him?

TREY:
I had to.

GINNY:
You had to?

TREY:
Yup.

GINNY:
You had to sleep with Drew Brees.

TREY:
Yes.

GINNY:
Do you mean that you slept next to Drew Brees or that you had sex with him?

TREY:
I slept with Drew Brees.

GINNY:
Do you mean like, you knew Drew Brees as a kid and you guys had a sleep over?

TREY:
I slept with Drew Brees.

GINNY:
Do you mean like you guys played football together in high school and you had to share a bed on an out of town trip?

TREY:
I slept with Drew Brees.

GINNY:
Why are you being so weird about this?

TREY:
What? I'm just telling you something interesting about myself.

GINNY: [making air quotes ]
You are sitting there grinning like a hyena telling me you "slept" with Drew Brees.

TREY:
Well, it's true. I slept with Drew Brees.

GINNY:
Why won't you elaborate? Why won't you say anything else about it?

TREY:
There is nothing more to it. I. Slept. With. Drew. Brees.

GINNY:
Look, I don't care who sleeps with who. It's really none of my business. But I got on OKCupid to meet a guy I could date but I don't really think I can date you if you're gay. I mean, you're just not going to be into it.

TREY:
I'm not gay.

GINNY:
Well, was it a phase? An experimental time? Wait....is Drew Brees gay? I'm pretty sure if he is, he's not out of the closet.

TREY:
As far as I know, he is not.

GINNY:
Well, this is incredibly frustrating. I don't know if you can tell or if you care, but I'm getting very agitated. Is this how you hoped this date would go? That you would take me to the Olive Garden, we would sit down, I would order pasta, you would order a hamburger off the kids menu and then you precede to drive me crazy with your weird "story" about how you "slept" with Drew Brees?

TREY:
People don't usually get this upset.

GINNY:
Oh don't they? Don't they? They're just like "You slept with Drew Brees? Great! Man, these are awesome hot wings! When are we going to see 'Your Highness'."

TREY:
Well not exactly.

GINNY:
Okay, let me give you a taste of your own medicine. I....uh...I slept with Megan Fox.

TREY:
Hot.

GINNY:
Okay, you're a dick. I'm leaving, You can have my pasta in addition to your burger.

TREY:
I don't want your icky pasta.

[ She gets up. ]

TREY:
Wait. Okay, I played baseball with Drew Brees the summer after high school. We played a tournament out of town. We were assigned to a hotel room together and there was only one bed. So we slept in the same bed.

GINNY:
Was that so hard? Was it so hard to just clarify what you meant instead of just being a smart ass over and over again? I'm still leaving.

TREY:
I'm not eating your pasta!

GINNY:
Good luck on your next date.

[ GINNY leaves. WAITER enters with plates. ]

TREY:
He put his dick in my butt.

MOM:
Don’t you hate it when that happens?

SON:
Let’s see. It goes it’s gonna take money. A whole lot of spending money. It’s gonna take a whole lot of money to do it right, child.

MOM:
It’s gonna take time. A whole lot of precious time. It’s gonna take patience and time. O-oh.

Wasn’t it first recorded by R&B singer James Ray?

SON:
Yeah. You’re right.

MOM:
1962.

SON:
But it was written by Rudy Clark.

MOM:
I didn’t know that. George Harrison recorded it in 1987. You know, his album Cloud Nine.

SON:
Duh. It was a number one hit in 1988.

MOM:
To do it to do it to do it to do it to do it to do it right, child.

MOM:
That’s not it.

SON:
Nope.

MOM:
Why haven’t you cut your hair? You look like a slob.

SON:
There’s nothing wrong with my hair. You’re just too out of touch.

MOM:
It might help you meet a girl. And then you might be happy.

SON:
You think I’m unhappy? What about you and Paul?

MOM:
What does Paul have to do with this?

SON:
Oh c’mon we both know you regret it.

MOM:
I love Paul why can’t you two get along.

SON:
He’s such a tool and he walks all over you.

MOM:
Don’t talk about your dad like that.

SON:
He’s not my real dad.

MOM:
Maybe Paul isn’t right for me now but he was five years ago and we had some really good times and he’s a good man so I’m willing to stay with him for now to see if he can change.

SON:
How can you wait for him to change when he may not even change maybe he’s going to be a jerk forever and then where will you be I just want to see you happy.

MOM:
Look out for that car. Don’t get in a wreck.

SON:
I can see the car. I got this under control.

FRANK
So, this is my apartment.

LISA
Oh, it’s cozy.

FRANK
It’s cozy? You mean small. Well, this is all that I can afford. So thanks for pointing out that I’m poor.

LISA
OK. It’s a little dark in here.

FRANK
No problem let me just --

[ Frank pulls an imaginary chain under Bryan’s lamp shade. ]

BRYAN
CLICK!

LISA
What’s with --

FRANK
What’s with what?

LISA
The uh --

FRANK
My lamp? You like my lamp.

LISA
That’s not a --

FRANK
Oh great! You know, you meet a girl and you think, “Wow. She’s smart, pretty, she gets me and I actually might get somewhere with her because she looks easy, but she freaks out the minute you get her home because you have a man lamp.”

LISA
I’m not freaking out. Man-lamp?

FRANK
Sorry, I’m just a little on edge ever since [ whispering ] the divorce.

LISA
Oh you poor thing.

FRANK
How about you have a seat I’ll get you a nice glass of wine.

LISA
Sounds great.

[ Frank exits. Lisa sits. Bryan throws off the lamp shade, covers Lisa’s mouth with his hand. ]

BRYAN
OK look. I’m not a real lamp.

[ Lisa moves his hand. ]

LISA
I knew it!

BRYAN
Shhh! I was playing a prank on my roommate, he’s a lamp salesman at a lamp store.


LISA
Lamptastic?!

BRYAN
I wish! That place is great. It’s the one with the giant light bulb and the paper machee Bigfoot on the roof. You know, on Chestnut and 3rd.

LISA
Lampapalooza?

BRYAN
No, that’s on Maple and 3rd.

LISA
Really? I thought --

BRYAN
Remember the jingle?

[ singing ]

If you need a lamp to light your room
To free your home from shadow and gloom

[ Lisa joins in ]

Then come on down to Maple and 3rd
Lampapalooza that’s the word.
Lamp-a-palooza.

[ They both laugh hardily. ]

FRANK [ from offstage ]
Who’s ready for drinky?

BRYAN
SHIT!

[ Bryan leaps over the couch and sets the lamp shade on his head. He is a lamp again. Frank enters.  ]

FRANK
I hope you like Boone’s Farm.

LISA
I do.

FRANK
You said, “I do.” That means were married, huh?

LISA
I guess so.

FRANK
No, marriage is hell. You have to drink from the bottle. The wife -- I mean ex-wife took the glasses in the divorce.

LISA
That’s fine. I guess.

FRANK
You look like the type that’d be alright with that. You know what would be great with this? Some Ritz crackers and cheese?

LISA
Yummy.

FRANK
Be back in two and two.

[ Frank exits, Bryan sits on the couch, he is shadeless. Lisa excitedly begins to sing the lamp jingle but Bryan interrupts. ]

BRYAN
So anyway, I go to the lamp store, my friends working, and I put this lampshade on my head. You know, hey look at me. I’m a lamp. And this guy bought me. I couldn’t believe it. He brings me home. He and his wife got into this big fight about a man-lamp. They got a divorce. For a year and four months he curled up by my feet and slept in that corner. I was his only friend.

[ Bryan’s and Lisa’s eyes meet. They slowly lean in for a kiss. ]

Lisa can you come in here for a moment?

[ Lisa crosses to the kitchen ]

FRANK
OK look. I know he’s not a real lamp. But just look at the guy. He thinks he makes such a convincing lamp, and he was my only companion during the divorce.

LISA [ moving back to the living room, Frank follows ]
This is wrong and kind of gross and I’m not going to play along with this.

FRANK
Play along with what?

[ Bryan sneezes. ]

LISA
What was that?

FRANK
You farting.

LISA
Nope.

[ She removes the lampshade. Bryan cowers and hides his face. Frank is horrified. ]

LISA
You’re not a lamp. People can’t be lamps.

BRYAN
What?

LISA
People can’t be lamps.

BRYAN
You lampist.

FRANK
Well I’m glad this came out before things got serious.

BRYAN
Get out of here anti-lampite!

[ Lisa runs away crying. ]

FRANK
Women.

BRYAN
I love your cozy apartment.

FRANK
Thanks.

[ They awkwardly banter. ]

BRYAN
This lighting is kind of --

FRANK
It is dark.

[ Bryan puts on the lampshade. Frank pulls the chain. ]

BRYAN
Click!

[ LIGHTS DOWN FOR ONE MOMENT, THEN BACK UP. ]

JOEL
That was for you, mom! What a trip down memory lane!

ADAM [ from audience ]
Be-traitor!

JOEL
Shut up, mom!

CURTIS
Joel, that didn’t sound like--

ADAM
No, it is I, Adam Hilton, formerly of The Plurals, currently of the Austin beard community.

[ He steps onstage. ]

COURTNEY Oh, shiiiiiiiiiiit. It’s Adam Hilton, the little guy from The Plurals.

[ Curtis and Courtney step to the side. ]

ADAM
You have broken a sacred bond, Joel Osborne. The golden gossamer thread that bound our souls together has been severed by your betraital.

JOEL
Betraital?

ADAM
Yes. I gave you no permission to perform this sketch tonight. Therefore, by ancient right, your tongue is mine.

JOEL
I submit to my fate.

[ Joel kneels. Adam pulls out a dinner knife. ]

COURTNEY
Take his tongue, but please don’t ruin his funny moustache!

CURTIS
We coast on his moustache so, so much!

ADAM
No promises.

COURTNEY
Mercy! He only did it for his poor, sick mother.

ADAM
And what about my mother? Do her feelings count for nothing?

[ Leah enters, wearing her Golden Girls getup. ]

LEAH
I’m Adam Hilton’s mother, and I only had one wish in life: to never see this sketch performed without Adam.

ADAM
Thank you, mother.

[ They kiss on the mouth. ]

LEAH
Adam, you are a good son, so strong and powerful.

ADAM
Everything I am, I owe to you, mother.

[ They kiss more deeply this time. Adam drops the knife. ]

LEAH
When I look at you as a grown man, I feel such pride to know that it was my womanly body that gave you form and life.

ADAM
You are the field from whence I sprouted. I honor you as all men honor the vast and mysterious ocean.

LEAH
Pay homage to me.

[ They continue making out. Joel moves over to Curtis and Courtney, still on his knees. ]

JOEL
Wow. That is something.

CURTIS
It’s kind of beautiful, in a way.

COURTNEY
It really isn’t.

CURTIS
Being a mother is serious business.

COURTNEY
It really is.

JOEL
Just look at those two go. It’s almost making me a little uncomfortable.

CURTIS
Joel, this is perfectly natural!

COURTNEY
It really isn’t, guys, it really isn’t.

[ Pause. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. MUSIC (#1). JOEL AND CURTIS ENTER. ]

Joel and Curtis do some kind of brief intro.

[ LIGHTS OUT.]

[ MUSIC DURING LIGHTS OUT (#2). ]

[ LIGHTS UP. A V/O ANNOUNCEMENT (#3). ]

V/O:
Ladies and gentlemen! Put your hands together for The Beach Boys!

[ THE TWO BEACH BOYS ENTER. ]

BB1:
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

BB2:
Hope you're all having fun. You having fun?

[ Beat. ]

All right.

BB1:
My name is Eddie Vale. I performed on the bass guitar for Al Jardine's Original Beach Boys family.

BB2:
My name is Brad D'Fazio. People call me Brad D. I was on additional percussion -- xylophone, etc. -- for Mike Love's Beach Boys and Friends Reunion Tour.

BB1:
We are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
And we're glad to be here at the 2009 Nucksua County Auto Show. There's a lot of really exciting stuff going on all around us.

BB1:
Cars.

BB2:
That woman over there.

[ Beat. ]

Cars, mostly. You know what I'm talking about.

BB1:
And of course if you know and enjoy songs such as "Little Deuce Coupe" and "Fun, fun, fun" you understand that cars are a big part of The Beach Boys mythos.

BB2:
It's a very inspiring subject matter. Really there's a lot to pull from it.

BB1:
Of course, we were not involved in the writing of those songs.

BB2:
Nor were we part of the original recordings.

BB1:
Come to think of it, I don't think either of us performed those songs on our tours.

BB2:
That is pretty odd when you think about it.    

BB1:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
I want to be very clear, we are not here to perform music.

BB1:
Yes, I think we should get that out of the way up front before there's any confusion. We understand if, in light of this, you may not want to stick around, you may want to go take a look at some of those new Hyundais...

BB2:
The ad in the paper might've been misleading.

BB1:
But, the truth is, neither of us is really that into music anymore.

BB2:
No, not at all. Not at all.

BB1:
After the conclusion of our respective tours of duty, so to speak, we got in touch with each other. Started booking ourselves at various events under the name "The Beach Boys".

BB2:
Figured we had every right to, and no one ever seemed to have a problem with it.

BB1:
Until they actually showed up for the shows, and there was a lot of screaming.

BB2:
Really stressful.

BB1:
Long story short --

BB2:
-- we have been banned from Joe's Crab Shack chain of restaurants.

BB1:
For three months.

BB2:
Longest three months of my life.

BB1:
Anyway.

BB2:
Anyway.

BB1:
We've kind of given up the music thing.

BB2:
That's right. Mostly we're just two friends who enjoy doing things together, now.

BB1:
That's right, so we thought we'd come to the auto show.

BB2:
I like cars.

BB1:
I got no problem with 'em.

BB2:
And we saw this little raised, stage-like area.

BB1:
The very one before you now.

BB2:
And I said, "Eddie?"

BB1:
And I said, "Yes, Brad D?"

BB2:
And I said, "Watch this." And I grabbed the microphone attached to the PA system, and I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, The Beach Boys!"

BB1:
And then we pretty much just jumped up on this stage and started talking.

BB2:
And that pretty much catches you all up to speed, right?

BB1:
There was no ad in the paper.

BB2:
No, that was just me riffing.

BB1:
Anyhow, since we're up here, we might as well talk about some things.

BB2:
Yeah, let you know what we've been up to.

BB1:
We're out of the music game, for one thing.

BB2:
Good riddance.

BB1:
I've been thinking about picking up some new hobbies.

BB2:
I already got cars to tide me over.

BB1:
I want to do the thing you do with the wood you find on the beach, you know?

BB2:
I like crafts.

BB1:
Yeah, things you can do with your hands.

BB2:
Very natural.

BB1:
I don't know what that's called though, so I'm having a hard time finding a book on it.

BB2:
If anyone knows what that's called, you pick up the microphone over there and just holler it out.

BB1:
I see some new people milling around at the edge of the crowd.

BB2:
So if you've just joined us, we're The Beach Boys --

BB1:
-- Eddie and Brad D --

BB2:
-- we don't perform music anymore --

BB1:
-- and we need to know the name of the thing where you take wood from the beach and make an art thing out of it.

BB2:
Uh ... does anyone have any questions?

BB1:
OK, it looks like you guys are kind of dispersing.

BB2:
Yeah, crowd's breaking up a little.

BB1:
Fair enough, fair enough.

BB2:
We really have no particular right to be up here in the first place.

BB1:
Yeah, we didn't have anything to say in particular.

BB2:
This thing we're doing up here has kind of run its course.

BB1:
Now I feel almost like I'm talking just to talk, like I'm locked in the groove.

BB2:
And I'm starting to see that there are some men in badges coming toward us.

BB1:
Probably security officers.

BB2:
Probably. And why not? They're just doing their jobs, we're obviously not a part of this show in any official way...

BB1:
It's pretty clear that we're breaking some rules right now.

BB2:
Not that the auto show necessarily has rules written down somewhere, but I think we can all agree that there's some unspoken rules...

BB1:
Like trash, for example. No rule you gotta put it in the can, but come on.

BB2:
And you don't see anyone else just climbing up on stage and running their mouths, so, I think, shame on us, ultimately.

BB1:
I think we just had an idea that we thought would be fun for us, but we didn't really consider whether it would be fun for other people.

BB2:
We didn't think of the consequences! Didn't think of the consequences.

BB1:
Now we'll probably be fined, in some way.

BB2:
Or sent home, more likely, without seeing as many of these exciting prototypes as I would've liked to.

BB1:
And we're still talking...

BB2:
We're still talking!

BB1:
Which goes to show, we still have a lot of growing up to do, the two of us, in terms of learning from our mistakes.

BB2:
But really, that's for us to figure out. We don't need to burden you by making this a public spectacle.

BB1:
Thankfully, it seems that almost all of you are just walking around now, not really paying attention.

BB2:
And it would appear that our security escort is waving us off the stage.

BB1:
So we'll go quietly.

BB2:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB1:
It's certainly been a pleasure.

BB2:
And, uh ... keep on surfing.

[ THEY EXIT. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ MUSIC DURING LIGHTS OUT (#4). ]

[ LIGHTS UP. TWO GUYS SIT ON A COUCH: G1 and G2. ]

G1:
So, how are things lately, man?

G2:
My girlfriend is upset with me.

G1:
Sorry to hear that. What's the problem?

G2:
I don't know.

[ G2 makes jerk off motions. ]

G1:
Can you think of anything you could have done to upset her?

G2:
I don't know.

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Do you guys fight a lot?

G2:
Yes.

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
So it's safe to say it may have been something you did?

G2:
Who knows?

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
You make that gesture a lot.

G2:
What gesture?

G1:
Do you care about Jennifer?

G2:
You know.

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Let's try something. Tell me about your relationship with your father.

G2:
Oh. OK. We never got along that well, I mean, he was always...

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Interesting. Tell me about the first time a close friend or relative died.

G2:
Hmm. It was my uncle. Uncle Greg. I remember going to the funeral and...

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
So, you didn't care for Uncle Greg?

G2:
No, Uncle Greg was a great guy and... you know...

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Would you say you have trouble expressing your emotions?

G2:
No. I wouldn't say that.

G1:
I really care about you as a friend.

G2:
Thank you.

G1:
I mean you are one of the most important people in my life. I cherish our friendship.

G2:
Wow. That's very kind.

G1:
Do you have anything you would like to say to me?

G2:
You know...

[ Jerks off.]

G1:
Thanks, buddy.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ MUSIC DURING LIGHTS OUT (#5). ]

[ LIGHTS UP ON A DOCTOR AND A PATIENT. THE PATIENT IS SITTING ON AN EXAMINATION TABLE, THE DOCTOR SITTING ON A CHAIR IN FRONT OF HIM. ]

PATIENT:
So it's serious, doctor?

DOCTOR:
No, not yet. But we do need to take it seriously. It's my recommendation that we operate.

PATIENT.
Oh God. Oh God.

DOCTOR:
It's going to be all right, Mr. Watkins. The surgery is not especially dangerous. And I can say, without arrogance, that I'm the man to do it.

[ Beat. ]

This was my area of specialization in medical school. For this procedure, you will not find a more qualified surgeon in 1,000 miles.

PATIENT:
OK, OK.

[ Beat. ]

I'm sorry I kind of lost it there.

DOCTOR:
You're doing fine. Now, let's talk about scheduling, is that all right?

PATIENT:
Sure, sure. I'm ready.

DOCTOR:
As it happens, I'm not available for a couple of weeks, but we can operate just as soon as I am.

PATIENT:
Is that -- uh -- is that --

DOCTOR:
Mr. Watkins, as an expert, I assure you: There's no danger in waiting a couple of weeks.

PATIENT:
OK. But it'll just be two weeks, right?

DOCTOR:
Two weeks from today, I promise you.

PATIENT:
OK.

[ Bounds off the table. ]

OK. That sounds great, doc.

DOCTOR:
Excellent.

[ He begins paging through a file. Absent-mindedly. Makes notes with a pen. ]

Really, it's the best possible time. We'll get you in and out ... get Monday off from work, you know, and make sure you have someone to drive you there and back. The wife and I will be getting back from Burning Man that weekend, so I'll be refreshed...

[ He looks up at the patient, who has frozen. ]

Something wrong?

PATIENT:
Uh ... no.

[ Pause. Patient fidgets while doctor resumes writing. ]

You and your wife are going on vacation then?

DOCTOR:
We are! We're quite looking forward to it.

PATIENT:
To, uh ... Burning Man?

DOCTOR:
That's right.

[ Beat. ]

Something wrong?

PATIENT:
In the desert?

DOCTOR:
Well, let me check the brochure.

[ The doctor pulls a small brochure out of patient's file. ]

That's right, in Nevada. My brother-in-law says it's quite something.

[ Hands brochure to patient. ]

PATIENT:
Isn't this the um -- uh --

DOCTOR:
Yes?

PATIENT:
The -- uh -- sorry, the --

[ Beat. Extends arms. ]

-- uh, fire guy --

[ Beat. ]

-- the big drug thing?

[ Beat. Doctor chuckles. ]

DOCTOR:
Well, they say it's a week-long exercise in "radical self-expression," so use your imagination.

PATIENT:
Are you going to, uh -- well --

DOCTOR:
Try a few things?

[ Chuckles. ]

We'll see where it goes. We're mostly going to show off our art car, but what's the point unless you're open to all the wild possibilities?

PATIENT:
Uh -- oh, was that your car in the parking --

DOCTOR:
Yes, with the astroturf and --

PATIENT:
-- shards of mirror --

DOCTOR:
That's it. It started out as just a hobby. And then foom.

[ Makes explosion gesture. ]

It took over. I've come to consider myself a car artist first and foremost. Though medicine is still a fairly important part of my life.

PATIENT:
Right.

DOCTOR:
My second biggest priority, at least.

[ Beat. ]

I'm really looking forward to this trip. I want to feel a deep connection with people, the way I did before Phish stopped touring.

[ Beat. ]

Things got dark after that, man.

PATIENT:
Excuse me?

DOCTOR:
It was a very troubling period of my life, Mr. Watkins.

PATIENT:
You know, I should probably look at my calendar, but I think maybe we ought to do the surgery later that week.

DOCTOR:
Nonsense. I'll return from Burning Man on Sunday night and get in at least two or three hours of sleep. Then a hot cup of coffee, and then straight into the operating room with you, Mr. Watkins. With a free mind and clean hands.

PATIENT:
OK.

DOCTOR:
Hey, can I get your opinion on something? I've been thinking about creating a different atmosphere in these examination rooms. They've always felt a little cold and sterile to me.

[ He flips a switch. RED LIGHTS ON. WEIRD PSYCHEDELIC FOLK MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY (#6). ]

I think something like this could help patients connect with their primal essence. The part that can heal itself.

PATIENT:
Uh.

DOCTOR:
If you like this, you'll love the operating room. You can't imagine how extraordinary the endocrine system looks under black light. Of course, you won't be awake to see that--

PATIENT:
Uh.

DOCTOR:
Unless you'd like to be. There are many more natural alternatives to traditional anesthesia that you might want to consider. There's a wonderful root I've discovered behind my house. It's not only a very thrilling hallucinogen, but, in distilled form, a potent short-term paralytic. If you'd like one, though, you should probably tell me now, because I was planning on bringing them to Burning Man.

PATIENT:
Well, uh... I don't know.

DOCTOR:
Tell you what, try one on me, and if you like it, we'll talk.

[ He pulls a piece of root out from his cheek and offers it to patient. ]

PATIENT:
Um, doctor ... no aspersions to your expertise, of course, but I think I might want to get a second opinion. Just in case.

DOCTOR:
Perfectly reasonable, Mr. Watkins. I've given you a traditional medical approach, but there are exciting alternative possibilities you can explore. I know some healers who are doing very exciting things with whale powder and panda bear gum.

PATIENT:
Sure, I might look into that.

[ Extends his hand. Pause. ]

DOCTOR:
Ah yes, sorry. I forgot what hands do for a moment.

[ They shake. ]

Isn't it fantastic that we do have hands? We could easily be squid people, with tentacles. But I digress.

PATIENT:
Thanks, doctor.

[ He hustles out the door. ]

DOCTOR:
Make sure you talk to our receptionist about getting scheduled!

PATIENT:
Right.

[ HE EXITS. ]

DOCTOR:
I feel so safe here.

[ He looks at his hands. ]

Oh dear. I better stop my skin melting if I'm going to operate.

[ Beat. ]

Oh, there it goes.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ MUSIC DURING LIGHTS OUT (#7). ]

[ LIGHTS UP on two dudes sitting on a couch (D1 and D2). ]

D1:
Do you smell that?

D2:
I smell something.

D1:
Do you smell what I'm smelling?

D2:
No, I smell what I'm smelling.

D1:
But it could be the same thing I'm smelling.

D2:
It could be.

D1:
There's really no way for us to know.

D2:
Do you think there could be two different smells in here?

D1:
At least. And we could be smelling any number of them together or separately.

[ Beat. ]

D2:
Let's use descriptive language to arrive at common ground.

D1:
About the smells?

D2:
Yes, the smells.

D1:
What I smell smells like a mustard fart trapped in an old rubber balloon.

D2:
I see. What I smell smells like thirty-six-hour-dead roadkill.

D1:
So they're different.

D2:
Not necessarily. One common inspiration might have produced two very different descriptions.

D1:
True.

D2:
As when one beautiful sunset inspires a whole legion of poets.

D1:
Each to a different flight of fancy.

D2:
Each to his own idiosyncratic rhapsody.

D1:
Or hers.

D2:
Pardon.

D1:
Well, then I think we can both agree -

D2:
-yes-

D1:
- that we are both -

D2:
- Uh-huh -

D1:
- smelling something bad.

D2:
Agreed.

[ Pause. ]

D1:
The question presents itself: What is to be done?

D2:
A proposal.

D1:
Yes?

D2:
We accept it and we move on.

D1:
Explain.

D2:
In life there are many smells. Some are good, some are bad. They come; they go. For the most part, they run their course without being identified. It's best just to move on. Especially when you rent.

D1:
That's unacceptable. You and I are human beings. We have independent thought and free will. We have science. I propose that we identify this smell and find a way to remove it.

D2:
We are two different people.

D1:
We are.

D2:
With different perspectives and temperaments.

D1:
Yes. Different backgrounds and experiences.

D2:
That too.

D1:  
Well. I have proposed a plan of action, and I wouldn't be much of a man if I didn't see it through.

D2:
Godspeed, my friend.

[ D1 exits and from off stage makes sniffing, gagging, and near-vomiting sounds. D2 remains seated and is inexpressive. D1 enters. ]

D2:
What happened?

D1:
I failed.

D2:
You did not fail. Your journey has just begun.

[ D1 sits next to D2 and lays his head down. D2 cradles D1's head. ]

D1:
I hate it. I hate it so much.

Gotta have class!

"Tits that won't quit."

JOEL:
Let me tell you a story about one of the craziest chicks this cool cat has ever known. She went by the name of "Aunt Susan" -- or at least she did to me. Short hair and a looooong attitude. The year was 1982, and I was fresh outta Wombsville when I met her. She took to me like butter to a roll. I don't know if it was the warm bottles or the bouncies on the knee, but this guy fell and he fell hard. Ever since then, I've been a fool -- a fool for -

Tuesday night, it's 7:06 pm. Your esteemed narrator is in the company of his two best friends -- a pair of fine gentlemen named Martin Smirnoff and House, MD. I don't know if Martin's really the name, but for the purposes of this story ... OK. We all get it. These two peepers creep over to my desk calendar, and in red letters big as the Ritz I spy those three magic words: "Aunt Sylvia's Birthday". So I pause my DVR, pick up the phone, and set my fingers dialing. Aunt Sylvia's still at work, because she lives on the west coast.

JOEL:
Aunts, working hard, working hard. Auntsssss.

CURTIS:
I give it an hour, and I try again. This time, I get through. And I hear a voice that's honey to my ears.

JOEL:
Who is this?

Aunt Sylvia, it's Curtis. Happy birthday!

PIZZA MAN: [ anxious ]
You call for pizza delivery?

JOE: [ excited but unaware of pizza man's nervousness ]
Yeah, man! How much is it?

PIZZA MAN: [ taking out a bill, his hand is shaking ]
Uh...

[ He drops it. He and Joe both try to pick it up and fumble around with it. ]

$22.85. Sign here.

[ PIZZA MAN gives JOE a pen and JOE casually looks for a place to write, finally settling on the wall. The pen doesn't work. ]

JOE:
This one's out of ink. I have a pen here somewhere.

[ JOE puts the pen down, looks around, eventually realizes that he has a pen in his pocket. PIZZA MAN is becoming more and more nervous. ]

PIZZA MAN: [ under his breath ]
Come on, man, come on......

[ JOE saunters back with the pen and signs the paper, which he hands to PIZZA MAN, who snatches it away. ]

PIZZA MAN:
The pen, the pen, give me the pen.

JOE:
This is my pen.

PIZZA MAN:
No, give me my pen.

JOE:
It doesn't work.

PIZZA MAN:
My prints are all over that thing, man, give me my pen!

[ JOE retrieves the pen and gives it to PIZZA MAN. ]

JOE:
Hey, man, can you break a five?

PIZZA MAN: [ under his breath, checking behind him ]
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

[ Pizza man takes out his wallet and counts change out. ]

JOE:
Aw great, man, thanks.

[ PIZZA MAN starts to bolt. ]

JOE:
Wait! Wait man!

[ PIZZA MAN returns. ]

JOE:
My pizza?

PIZZA MAN:
Oh yeah, yeah.

[ PIZZA MAN opens the bag and motions for JOE to take it out. This gives JOE pause but he does it anyway. PIZZA MAN starts to bolt. ]

JOE:
Hey, man, wait!

[ PIZZA MAN returns. JOE starts counting out $3 hesitates, thinks, ponders, then gives the PIZZA MAN $4, who looks around the apartment before taking the money. ]

PIZZA MAN:
Thanks, uh, thanks man.

[ PIZZA MAN starts to bolt again. ]

JOE:
Hey man, wait....

PIZZA MAN:
WHAT?!

JOE: [ startled ]
Uh, I was just gonna ask if you had any of red pepper and parmesan.

PIZZA MAN:
I'm just trying to get out of here, man!

[ PIZZA MAN throws packets onto the ground and bolts, slamming the door. JOE is confused. JOE opens the box. There is no pizza. Joe rushes to the door, opens it. ]

JOE:
Hey, wait--

[ A voice from offstage. ]

VOICE:
Hey, pizza man, you think you're real smart, huh??

PIZZA MAN:
SHIT!

[ SOUND: A hail of gunfire.

Joe slams the door, presses his body against it. He pulls out his phone, dials a number. ]

JOE:
Hello ... I'd like to order a pizza ... a real pizza this time ... It's a long story ... Well, this guy delivered a pizza to me but there was no pizza in the box ... I guess it wasn't that long ... hahaha ... no, no, I think you're really funny too ... yeah ... yeah! ... that sounds great ... OK, bye.

[ He hangs up. ]

JOE:
Shit! I forgot to order a pizza. Well, it's too late now.

Listen listen listen listen hey ... shhh, shhh. You.

GIRL:

GUY:
If you get the noodles right now, I will 100% for real give you a million dollars that I have.

GIRL:
Shut up.

GUY:
For real I have a million dollars that I will pay you for noodles. All you have to do is go and get them. It is literally ridiculous that I am offering you this amount of money, but I am. I probably won't forgive myself. Like, ever. But I want those noodles. Do you want to be rich?

[ Long pause. Slowly (veeeery slowly), she begins to roll off the couch and stand up. She asks if various things onstage and off are the noodles. She finally gets two bowls of noodles. Both of them balance the bowls of noodles on their bellies and eat with their hands. ]

GUY:
Thank you.

GIRL:
Meeeeeeeeh.

GUY:
Here is the thing. I do not have a million dollars.

[ Long pause. Girl throws some noodles on the guy's face. He opens his mouth to bite at the noodles. ]

Barry (Courtney) is seated scribbling on a note pad. There is a plate of cheese cubes. Carl (Joel) is looking out a window in search of inspiration. Debbie (Curtis) is holding a cell phone and a file.

BELL.

They each grab a cheese cube and switch roles -- Curtis becomes Carl, Courtney becomes Debbie, Joel becomes Barry . ]

DEBBIE:
You told me Thursday. No, no no. You said you would have the order shipped by Thursday.

[ She hands the file to Barry. ]

You said you had it "under control."

[ She makes finger quotes. ]

Well I just used finger quotes. Yes, about what you said.

[ Debbie EXITS. ]

BARRY:
So.

CARL:
So.

BARRY:
We are two business men.

CARL:
Yes. We are.

BARRY:
Two business men who survived the collapse of an empire.

CARL:
Did we survive, Barry? At one time I had seven hundred employees. I made million dollar deals daily. I was powerful.

BARRY:
You still have power, Carl. Your name still means something.

CARL:
My name is meaningless now. At one point I could destroy a man with the push of a button. Not harm him physically but destroy everything in his life that brought him joy. Now, I have a staff of two in my garage.

[ Debbie ENTERS with another file. She is talking on the phone with the same person. ]

DEBBIE:
What do you mean people don't use finger quotes anymore?

[ She hands the file to Barry. ]

I saw someone use them the other day. At the store.

[ BELL.

The three each eat a cheese cube. The three characters rotate. Courtney is Carl, Curtis is Barry, and Joel is Debbie. ]

BARRY:
So.

CARL:
So, we start from scratch.

BARRY:
We've done it before, Carl.

CARL:
We'll have to start small. We need to go back to the basics.

BARRY:
We just need our start. An idea. A product. Something.

CARL:
I've got it! My son had a lemonade stand.

BARRY [ confused ]:
Okay.

CARL:
When he was twelve he made lemonade. A pitcher of lemonade.

BARRY:
I'm gonna write this down.

CARL:
Good idea.

BARRY [ saying what he is writing ]:
Son made lemonade by the pitcher.

CARL:
So he made a pitcher of lemonade and sold the lemonade by the glass.

BARRY:
This is good.

CARL:
He charged fifty cents a glass.

BARRY:
Great. Great.

CARL:
Then he would come home empty handed because he was a failure.

BARRY [stops writing]:
Okay.

CARL:
So I hit him.

[ Barry starts writing. ]

Don't write that last part.

[ Debbie ENTERS carrying a file. She is still having the same conversation. ]

DEBBIE:
Fine. Fine. Don't use finger quotes.

[ Debbie hands the file to Barry. ]

Just because people, myself included, still use them doesn't mean you have to. My weight has nothing to do with it!

[ Debbie puts her phone away. Barry opens a file and shredded newspaper falls on his lap. ]

BARRY:
Debbie, what do you know about lemonade stands?

DEBBIE:
Do you want to start a lemonade stand?

CARL:
Yes. Yes we do. Right now. Do you have any experience.

DEBBIE:
Well, I had one for a few summers when I was a little girl.

[ Carl and Barry share a look. ]

BARRY:
I've never seen one, however, it seems that we have now been excited by the idea of lemonade stands.

CARL:
So we will, of course, over the next few days be obsessed with lemonade stands and everything related to lemonade stands.

DEBBIE:
Very good, sir.

CARL:
You do have the most experience here. Where do you suggest we start?

DEBBIE:
Okay. I have an idea.

[ BELL.

The three each eat a cheese cube. The three characters rotate. Joel is Carl, Courtney is Barry, and Curtis is Debbie. ]

CARL:
This better be good, Debbie.

DEBBIE:
I'm on it, sir.

[ Debbie EXITS. ]

CARL:
This has to be good, Barry.

BARRY:
It will be, Carl. It will be.

CARL:
It's too late to dream of being back on the top, but halfway up wouldn't be so bad.

BARRY:
No sir. I think we have a good shot with this one.

[ Debbie ENTERS on the phone. ]

DEBBIE:
It needs to say "Lemonade for sale." 'For' should be the number four. And print some letters backwards.

[ Barry hands the files to Debbie. Debbie turns to exit. ]

BARRY:
Now, we need to think of locations.

[ BELL TWICE.

Carl, Debbie, and Barry share confused looks. They slowly move towards the table and each take two cheese cubes. ]

CARL:
So, I guess I'm Barry again.

DEBBIE:
No, you'll be Debbie.

BARRY:
Why does he get to be Debbie. I want to be Debbie

DEBBIE:
The bell rang twice. I assume we rotate twice.

CARL:
Besides, you make a lousy Debbie.

BARRY:
You think you're a better Debbie?

CARL:
I feel like a Debbie.

BARRY:
You're not even a woman!

CARL:
Neither are you!

BARRY:
Yes I am!

DEBBIE:
Really?

[ A voice sounds from the booth or over the PA. ]

VOICE:
Hey guys. Um...We just got word that the university has cut our funding. The experiment is over. It appears that we never actually told anyone what we would be doing and why the data would be useful. It's actually kind of surprising they let us use their facilities for the last five years. Anyway, we're done here. So, if you would leave the testing floor, retrieve you're belongings, and exit the facility in a timely fashion they won't call security.

DEBBIE:
You know. I think I really learned something during all of this.

CARL:
I think we all did.

BARRY:
I learned you're a dick.

DEBBIE:
Debbie would never say that.

[ LIGHTS UP. A SALESWOMAN ENTERS. She is carrying a small box and a brochure. She approaches the door onstage and knocks on it. A MAN ANSWERS THE DOOR. ]

MAN
May I help you?

SALESWOMAN
Hello, sir. You’re interested in a magazine subscription.

MAN
Excuse me?

SALESWOMAN
As long as you’re subscribing to a magazine, why not support a good cause?

MAN
Magazine?

SALESWOMAN
As you know, sir, I’m going door-to-door selling magazine subscriptions. There are over one-hundred magazines that you can choose from, sir. As you know, your subscription will help to support Americans who suffer from Hyperempathic Identification Disorder, or HID. Americans like you and me, sir, as you know.

MAN
You -- hold on, I’m lost.

SALESWOMAN
Take your time, sir. You’re in no hurry.

MAN
I’m not quite sure what’s happening.

SALESWOMAN
Sure you are. I’m selling magazine subscriptions--

MAN
Well, yes, I get that.

SALESWOMAN
Of course you do. There are all kinds of magazines you can subscribe to. There’s Cook’s Illustrated. You want to prepare more meals at home. There’s Travel. You can learn about all the hotspots in South America. Places that you’ve been dying to visit since you were a little girl.

MAN
I’m sorry. I think you may have me confused with someone else.

[ He closes the door. She is undeterred. A brief pause, then she knocks again. He answers the door. ]

MAN
Yes?

SALESWOMAN
Sir, as you know, Hyperempathic Identification Disorder is a serious disease that affects hundreds of Americans every year. Sufferers of HID like yourself have great trouble functioning in normal society. Even the slightest interaction can be difficult to someone with HID. Someone like you.

MAN
Look, I don’t have HID. At least I’m pretty sure I don’t, because I’ve never heard of HID.

SALESWOMAN
You can also purchase a subscription as a gift, sir. Your Aunt Kathleen sure would love a subscription to one of our music magazines. When you were a young girl, you used to love her crazy stories about her days on the road as an REO Speedwagon groupie.

MAN
I don’t have an Aunt -- what?

SALESWOMAN
Father’s Day is just around the corner. You know how your dad spends hours in the garage painting his Civil War figurines. Why not get him a subscription to Civil War Miniaturist? Only $49.99 a year, a very modest markup.

MAN
My father’s dead.

SALESWOMAN
No, that’s not correct. But while you’re giving gifts, you should also treat yourself. How about Puzzle Enthusiast? Doing a nice Sudoku always helps to clear your mind when you’re feeling despair about your terrible, tragic condition.

MAN
Are you ... all right?

SALESWOMAN
Of course not, sir. You suffer from HID.

MAN
What is HID?

SALESWOMAN
Hyperempathic Identification Disorder, as you know, sir, is the frequent inability to distinguish yourself from others. And vice versa. You’ve been struggling with it all your life. It makes it very difficult for you to relate to other people.

[ Pause. ]

MAN
What the fuck?

SALESWOMAN
Sir, you have a lot of nerve using that language with me when you’re standing outside of my house trying to sell me magazines.

MAN
I’m leaving. Goodbye.

[ He shuts the door. ]

SALESWOMAN
Hey! Get out of my house!

[ Beat. ]

I am such an asshole.

Art is playing Trivial Pursuit by himself ... he has a stack of cards; he pulls a card, looks at the question, looks at the answer, either smiles or frowns, repeats. Sandy is filling out a coloring book using a black sharpie.

An extended moment of silence as they do these things. ]

SANDY
I think it’d be pretty nice if we had some crayons.

ART
For the babies?

SANDY
For anyone.

[ Pause. ]

SANDY
Allison had her baby last Friday.

ART
Niiice.

SANDY
Yeah. At the hospital. I tried to convince her to do it here. No dice.

[ Art shrugs. ]

SANDY
It was crazy. I mean there she is, having a baby and there are these people everywhere. And they're carrying folders, and answering telephones and, you know, some of them seem to be in a real hurry and things can just get really ... brusque.

ART
That's ...

[ He shrugs. ]

SANDY
That's right.

ART
I mean, that's why we ...

[ He sort of twirls his fingers in the air. ]

SANDY
I know. That's what I thought.

[ ANGELA, a very relaxed and very pregnant lady, comes through the door, sipping hot tea from a paper cup. ]

ANGELA
What's up, guys?

ART
Not much, lady.

SANDY
What's up ... ... with you?

ANGELA
You know.

[ She sits down in an extremely casual posture. Pause. ]

ANGELA
So, what's up?

ART
Already asked.

[ Pause. ]

ANGELA
I know.

SANDY
We were just talking. About how we started this whole deal, and why.

ANGELA
Oh yeah?

[ She flips over in her seat, comfortably grabs and moves her pregnant belly to the side. ]

ART
We were talking because our friend Allison had a baby, but we couldn't convince her to go this route.

[ Twirls his fingers. ]

ANGELA
Her loss, man.

SANDY
A lot of women aren't prepared to consider the route of casual childbirth.

ART
Imagine her little baby ... first thing that baby sees in this world ...

SANDY
This crazy hospital where people are hurrying, and stressing, and all that junk.

ANGELA
Thumbs ... down.

[ She makes the thumbs-down, hops nimbly off her chair. ]

I'm feeling a little tight. You guys mind if I rock a few poses?

ART
Nuh-uh.

[ She does a series of yoga poses through the subsequent dialog, unimpeded by her pregnancy. ]

SANDY
So you thinkin' about having that baby today? Maybe tomorrow?

ANGELA
No hurry. Whenever.

ART
Baby'll come out when the baby's ready.

ANGELA
Or he can hang out in here as long as he wants. N ... B ... D.

ART and SANDY
Yup.

ART
You know, sometimes I don't even want people to think of this as a casual childbirth cooperative. I just want them to think of it as a really cool place to hang out.

ANGELA
That's how I think of it, guys.

SANDY
Thank you, Angela.

ART
It's just a place where everyone's cool, and it happens to also be a totally low-pressure, casual childbirthing environment.

SANDY
With zero stress.

ART
Like, if you're here and you think maybe you’re pregnant -- well, we’re here to help you have a baby.

SANDY
Maybe you’re not pregnant though. Maybe you just want to hang out.

ART
Yeah, that’s fine too.

SANDY
Maybe you just want to get to know some people, bang around a little, have some fun.

ART
Right. Maybe you like to party a little. Whatever.

SANDY
Maybe it’s “been a while”, so to speak, and you’re looking to get back on the scene, have some fun, a couple drinks, I don’t know, see what happens. It’s no big deal.

[ Angela breaks from her pose. ]

ANGELA
I'm not going out with you, Sandy.

SANDY
You shouldn't have to!

ANGELA
I know, I know -- but, for real.

ART
Hey Angela, I may just be hearing things, but I think maybe I just heard your water break.

ANGELA
What?

SANDY
You should check.

[ Angela pulls the waistband of her skirt open a little, glances down. ]

ANGELA
Whoa, there it goes.

ART
Looks like you're having this baby.

ANGELA
Looks like it. OK, you guys, well I better get to it, then.

You'll just give us a call if you need anything?

Will do, will do. I'm just gonna go draw me a bath.

SANDY
You ... ... do that.

[ She nimbly waddles out the door. Art and Sandy look at each other, nod, and exchange a high five.

LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ MUSIC during scene change. ]

Y GUY 4

[ LIGHTS UP on a Presidential press conference. The "audience" is REPORTER and Y GUY.

PRESIDENT
... so, in short, this administration stands behind this energy bill. Questions?

[ Reporter jumps around assuming the pose of different reporters saying "Mr. President! Mr. President! Mr. President!" Y Guy holds up his hand. President points to Y guy. ]

PRESIDENT
Yes. You.

Y GUY:
WHYYYYY?????????

PRESIDENT:
Uh...buh...uh....

[ Reporter walks to the front of the stage as if addressing a camera. ]

REPORTER:
In what has become a shocking turn of events, this presidency is literally crumbling under the intense pressures of the questions of one man. This rookie reporter has sent this administration into serious damage control mode. Sir, can I ask you a few questions?

Y GUY:
Sure.

REPORTER:
You've really taken this presidency to task on this energy bill, would you say that you're a pundit for the people?

Y GUY:
Yeah, yeah, I like to represent the everyman, I like to think I'm asking the questions that America wants to ask.

REPORTER:
Many people are saying you have no business questioning the president like this that you're a Washington outsider with no real knowledge of the administration.

Y GUY:
WHYYYYYY???????

[ Y guy puts on his Y guy hat, does a take to the audience.

LIGHTS OUT. ]

[ MUSIC during scene change. ]

[ LIGHTS UP on three people, each with a weapon and tattered clothes.

SOUND: An approaching horde. ]

[ Girl groans. Long pause. ]

GUY 2:
I'll go

GIRL:
Cool.

[ GUY 2 runs out screaming and is immediately killed.

SOUND FADES OUT.

GUY 1 pulls up his shirt and begins poking his finger into his navel. GIRL begins blowing into her own elbow pit.

SOUND: An approaching horde. ]

[ Long pause. ]

GIRL:
You go.

GUY:
No, you.

GIRL:
But here's the thing ... you.

GUY:
I understand, and you make a compelling point. However, you.

GIRL:
No, but see, think about it: you.

GUY:
Listen listen listen listen hey ... shhh, shhh. You.

GIRL:
I can't even hear what you're saying, because: you.

GUY:
My heart is beating in fear, and it's going youyouyouyouyouyouyouyouyou.

[ This goes on for a bit. ]

GUY:
Wait.

GIRL:
OK.

GUY:
This is stupid.

GIRL:
It is.

GUY:
If you go, I'll give you a million dollars.

GIRL:
Baloney.

GUY:
Look. I know how ridiculous it seems that I would have a million dollars, especially since I told you I had a million dollars before and it wasn't true then. You need to put that aside. Because I now have a million dollars. I do. For real. And I will give it to you.

[ Girl gets up and wanders around the stage as if looking for the hoard. When she realizes she has run out of places to look she trudges toward the door with a weak battle cry and is immediately killed.

SOUND FADES OUT. ]

GUY 2:
My life is 100% the best.

[ SOUND: An approaching horde.

LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ MUSIC. LIGHTS UP to thank the audience. ]

[ LIGHTS UP fast. Adam is standing onstage, wearing an Army surplus jacket and a guitar. He is caught off guard by the audience. ]

ADAM
Ah! Jesus!! Oh my god. Thank you … Jesus. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m Adam Hilton. Corporal Adam Hilton … U.S. Army veteran. Incidentally. Are you guys ready for some show?

[ Adam acts like he’s gonna strum his guitar as he gets the crowd jazzed up. ]

ADAM
You ready? Come on now, let’s hear it!

[ Adam leans into the strum. He pretends to play while the SEINFELD THEME plays. ]

ADAM [ in tremendous satisfaction ]
Love my new style!

[ COURTNEY pops her head out. ]

COURTNEY [ very annoyed ]
Adam!

[ Adam keeps grooving. ]

COURTNEY [ even more annoyed ]
Adam, god damn it!

[ Music stops as Adam looks over. Beat. ]

COURTNEY [ changing suddenly ]
I love what you’re doing! It makes me feel funny. Ha-ha funny.

[ Courtney exits. ]

ADAM
Haha … out of sight!

[ Adam keeps playing. ]

[ Curtis and Courtney enter, do an awkward version of the award show “meet in the middle, come downstage” maneuver. ]


COURTNEY
Curtis, can you believe it? 25 years of Your Terrific Neighbors.

CURTIS
Wait, what?

COURTNEY [ exultant ]
25 years! A big hand for our musical director: U.S. Army veteran Adam Hilton!

[ Adam plays the opening to “Star-Spangled Banner” on his guitar, points, laughs. ]

ADAM
I’m just happy to be here, providing terrific tunes for this momentous evening!

COURTNEY
A fun fact about Adam … You’re an U.S. Army veteran, right?

ADAM
… Honestly? … …. … … ... No.

COURTNEY
What about the jacket?

ADAM
This jacket belonged to my grandfather, a very brave man. He stole it from a veteran at a minor league baseball game. He could’ve gotten his tushie kicked!

[ Adam plays a dissonant chord. ]

ADAM [ in a baby voice ]
Ew, I’m sowwie!

[ Adam plays a little riff. ]

ADAM
Hahaha, good one, Courtney!

[ Courtney forgets that she’s mad, smiles and gives Adam a thumbs-up. ]

CURTIS
You told us you were the “original American Sniper.” You personally boasted to me of “124 confirmed kills.” It scared the shit out of me, but also made me want to do whatever you say.

ADAM
Well Curtis, I may not have any confirmed kills … but I can hit a minor chord …

[ He strums a chord. ]

ADAM
From a mile away.

[ Adam plays a little riff. ]

ADAM
Haha, Courtney, your shit is out-rageous.

[ Courtney smiles and nods vigorously. ]

COURTNEY [ to Curtis ]
I think he’s great.

CURTIS
He’s good. Folks, for years, Courtney and I have been proud to write short scenes that explore humorous situations. It’s something we call “sketch comedy.”

COURTNEY
And tonight, we leave it behind.

CURTIS [ pulls out a letter ] We’ve received a letter from the FBI, America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation, which in the year 2015, continues to exert repressive surveillance and control on sketch comedy, specifically, out of all the performing arts.

[ Courtney and Curtis try to incite the crowd to boo. ]

COURTNEY
So unfortunately, this will be our last performance ever. I know. I know! According to …

[ She snatches the letter. ]

COURTNEY
… to FBI Assistant Director for Sketch Comedy affairs, J. Edgar Hoover Jr. Jr. open parentheses The Third, close parentheses … The sketches of Your Terrific Neighbors are … I’m paraphrasing … A little too edgy and sophisticated and, in a word, smart for real Americans.

CURTIS
Well, Mr. Hoover Jr. Jr. The Third, what are we, exactly, if not real Americans? I guess you’re saying that the good folks in this audience aren’t real Americans? You want to tell me that the original American Sniper, U.S. Army veteran Adam Hilton isn’t a real American?!

ADAM
I’m a real American! Not a real veteran, though. We discussed that.

COURTNEY
Corporal Hilton, would you like to name some of the skits, bits, and little scenarios that the FBI thinks our beautiful American audience can’t handle?

ADAM [ takes out a list ]
Sure. Ahem. “Christmas Lights Sex, Golf Buddies Go Nuts, Toilet Janitor, Toilet Dad, Toilet Friends, Sex in The Toilet, Sex Commander, Fart Boys, Fart Girls, Fart Friends, Fart Club, Fart Business, Fart Wedding, Toilet Wedding, Sex Wedding, Two People Yelling parts 1-6, Sex Wedding in a Toilet, What if Justin Bieber Was In Breaking Bad digital parody, Toilet Baptism, Sex Baptism, Pope Farts, Time Travel Toilet, Time Travel Toilet Farts, Sex Dad, Sex Dad Goes to The Toilet, Sex Dad Farts in The Toilet, Caligula parody, Cannibal Holocaust parody, Gay Panic sketches 1-89, Porno Family, Porno Family Toilet Fart Reunion, The Butt Dancers, Macklemore at IKEA three-part runner, The Return of The Butt Dancers--”

COURTNEY
I think these good people get it, Adam.

CURTIS
Anyhow, due to the interference of big government, this will be the final Your Terrific Neighbors show. I know. I know! We encourage other performers at this festival to retire their troupes in solidarity with us. We’ll check on that tomorrow.

ADAM [ strummming, while Curtis and Courtney dance ]
Cuz it’s the last show … the last show … the last show … the last shooooooooooow!

[ stops ]

ADAM
You guys! What do you think you’ll do with your lives after the show’s gone for good?

COURTNEY
My god … It’s really over, isn’t it?



CURTIS
Let’s imagine and envision all the possibilities. Speaking for myself, I have some DVDs to return.

COURTNEY
I’m doing freelance graphic design. So if you need a poster, or a logo, or a Facebook banner, or a business card, I can remove a watermark, or add one. I’m also a good tutor. I used to do a lot of tutoring, back in high school, for example...

[ During previous, Curtis helps Courtney get dressed. A jock, wearing a basketball jersey, and a nerdy girl, both at a table covered with textbooks. The jock is constantly playing with a basketball. ]

COURTNEY [ trying to be patient ]
It’s algebra. You figure out what the value of x is. So we have to move these numbers around until we see what x equals.

CURTIS
Jeez louise, numbers and letters? My head is spinning. What if they fight?

COURTNEY
What?

CURTIS
Numbers and letters are different teams. They’ll be scrapping at each other like two pumas in a kennel.

COURTNEY
Where do you get this shit?

CURTIS
Coach told me. “Now you remember, Andy, different teams always play against each other. OCEANBEARS! Lemme see you swim-fish!”

[ He stands up and does a little dance. ]

COURTNEY
Cease that troglodytic nonsense! We have to get your grades to a passing average. I can’t help you in this moronic state of jock neanderthalism.

CURTIS
What? Huh? Duuuuuuuuuh.

COURTNEY
I will not see my admission to an Ivy League university derailed by a stupid monkey in a nylon jersey named you.

CURTIS
I thought you were doing this because we’re friends and you like me.

COURTNEY
Friends? Hardly. Friends?? You’ve got a funny idea of “friends.” Friends?!? I’m only here because of a comic coincidence that made it look like I was smoking weed drugs in the restroom, which I wasn’t. That put me in a tough situation where the assistant principal blackmailed me into helping you, the golden boy basketball captain, get your grades up. So you can play in the state finals.

CURTIS
Go OCEANBEARS! Lemme see you swim-fish!

[ He stands up and does a little dance. ]

COURTNEY
Focus, you big idiot!

[ She puts a peanut on the table. Curtis stops dancing, sits, and gobbles it up. ]

CURTIS
Uhhhhh.

[ She opens up another textbook. ]

COURTNEY
This is basic multiplication. Simple as it gets. Seven times five ... is?

CURTIS
Duh. I dunno! I’m too dumb. It's like my old man tells me: If god hadn't given me a talent for ball, I'd be riding a one-way train to nowheresville, just like my old man. My biological old man, not my step old man.

COURTNEY
You … have your own struggles?

CURTIS
Sure, everyone's my best friend, if we're having a good season. Teachers give me a pass, if we're having a good season. Most classtimes on most days, I'm crushing major puss in the bathroom, if we're having a good season. But really: I'm just a teenager with teenage problems and needs.

COURTNEY
I have emotions, too. And things that happen to me that make me feel various ways.

CURTIS
But you're a science girl.

COURTNEY
I've observed the structure of the atom. I've peered at the genetic code that gives us life. I've gazed at stars a billion light-years away. And what did I see? Nothing. The void. Death. And my mother is demanding! And I worry too much about the future, instead of enjoying the rockin' bod I have under these dowdy clothes.

CURTIS
Wow.

COURTNEY
I just wish I could help you understand this stuff.

CURTIS
It's no use. My head's too stupid for numbers. It's like my old man says: You puddle of stupid shitty goo, if you weren't so good at basketball, they'd grind you to nutrients and feed you to factory cattle.

COURTNEY
Gross.

CURTIS
If this was the court, I'd fake on these numbers and take it to the hole, basketball style!

COURTNEY
Hmmmm … basketball style, eh? Hmmmmmmm.

CURTIS
What’s that sound you make?

COURTNEY
It’s a thinking sound, dummy! Sorry. I’m starting to like you quickly as we share real feelings. Hmmmmm. Basketball style …


CURTIS
I love basketball. Hmmm. Basketball….

COURTNEY Basketball….

CURTIS Yeah, basketball.

COURTNEY
I’ve got an idea.

CURTIS What’s an idea?

COURTNEY I just need to put it in terms that you’ll understand. Let’s say I have … seven basketballs … and then I multiply by … five basketballs?

CURTIS
Duh. You’d have 35 basketballs.

[ She gasps in pleasure. ]

CURTIS
What? That’s just basic basketball. Any rookie could--

[ She opens up the other textbook. ]

COURTNEY
OK, OK. Now: solve for x. How many basketballs is x?

CURTIS [ immediately ]
What is this, junior varsity? x is 302.1 basketballs.

COURTNEY
By George, I think he’s got it!

[ Clutches her chest. She gets more and more into him with each correct answer, removes a garment of nerdy clothing. By this process, changes into her costume for the next sketch. ]

COURTNEY
What’s this … in my heart? Ah, god! American history!

[ She switches textbooks. ]

CURTIS
The Depression was a brick … but World War 2 was a real three-pointer!

COURTNEY [ gasping ]
My soul is hot! What’s happening?? Economics!

[ She switches textbooks. ]

CURTIS
If the basketball supply is low, but the basketball demand is high, basketball prices go up.

COURTNEY
OH, GOD! Cupid’s burning arrow in my heart-loins! Poetry!

[ She switches textbooks. Curtis reads. ]

CURTIS
One equal temper of heroic basketballs,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive for points, to seek the backboard, to find the hoop, and not to yield.

[ He wipes a tear. ]

CURTIS It’s beautiful.

COURTNEY
You’re beautiful. I couldn’t see that before. But now I see the beauty of your heart.

CURTIS
I … duuuuuuh.

COURTNEY
The basketballs ... inside you.

CURTIS
You mean that?

COURTNEY
I’m in love with you.

CURTIS
You, uh, wha?

COURTNEY
I’m … in basketballs with you.

CURTIS Sorry, I ...

COURTNEY
I’m basketballs with basketballs.

CURTIS
Still don’t get it.

COURTNEY
Basketballs basketballs basketballs.

CURTIS
Oh God, me too!

[ They embrace. ]

COURTNEY
Do you … want to do the next sketch together?

CURTIS I’m sorry?

COURTNEY
Basketball.

CURTIS
Yes!

[ Curtis exits, Courtney sits. Adam and Curtis enter. ]

ADAM
Ma’am? Chas Brewster is here.

AD EXEC
Thank you, Doug.

ADAM
I’m not Doug!! Doug is dead, don’t you get it? Dead!

[ Adam exits in a huff. ]

AD EXEC
Mr. Brewster. It’s an honor! I was at game three of the ‘93 World Series.

BREWSTER
You must have been just a tiny young thing.

AD EXEC
Oh, stop. I was, though. But I remember your steal in the fifth inning. So, you can imagine how excited I am to welcome you as the new face of Plumpems Double-Decker Dogs.

BREWSTER
I love hot dogs. I can endorse them in a very authentic way. And of course, hot dogs, baseball … a natural connection.

AD EXEC
Yes. We have a real challenge here, though. The hot dog is an American classic. People don’t always like it when you mess with a classic.

BREWSTER
So what’s the deal with this hot dog?

AD EXEC
It’s a double decker dog. So it’s … two.

BREWSTER Just one on top of the other.

AD EXEC
There’s a thin membrane like … between the dogs. So they’re linked together, like siamese dogs.

BREWSTER
Gotcha. You’re basically getting two hot dogs.

AD EXEC
Our target is people who’d like to have two hot dogs instead of just one. We think the most natural fit is the “hungry man” demographic. You know, “boom, eat this.” “Bam, here’s some food for your mouth.” “This is man meat, brother.” Plumpems Double-Decker Dogs should be perceived as masculine, powerful.

BREWSTER
You picked the right guy.

AD EXEC
Absolutely. We’ll do series of television spots, linked with the same premise: This hot dog keeps beating you.

BREWSTER
What do you mean?

AD EXEC
Making a fool of you. Mastering you. Defeating you. Shaming you. Umm … Let’s see … More synonyms … Conquering you. Embarrassing you. Making you a chump, a loser, a patsy. Thrashing you. Annihilating you. Getting the jump on you at every turn. Sending you back to school. Humiliating you.

BREWSTER
Could you be a little more specific?

AD EXEC
Here’s one idea. You’re playing a charity game. You’re on third, and you go for the steal, like in ‘93. You think you’re safe, but the ref calls you out. You look down and see, oops, that Plumpems Double-Decker Dog is there, and it tagged you out. Tagline: “You can’t beat a Plumpems Double-Decker Dog.”

BREWSTER
How does he tag me out?

AD EXEC
He has a glove. We see that he’s got the ball. It’ll work.

BREWSTER
So I’m playing baseball, which my reputation is built on, and I get beat by a hot dog.

AD EXEC
That’s right.

BREWSTER
Sounds fun. What else?

AD EXEC
Well, we need broad appeal. There are folks out there who know your face, but don’t care about baseball.

BREWSTER
Sure.

AD EXEC
Maybe you’re trying to get your kid into the last spot at an elite private school. You’re talking to the principal. She says, “Mr. Brewster, I have some bad news.” And you see a hot dog kid in the classroom. He’s a miniature double-decker dog, wearing a little backpack. And you hear someone laughing at you, and you turn around and--

BREWSTER It’s that damn hot dog!

AD EXEC
He beat you again. He beat you.

BREWSTER
You know what’d be the damndest thing? What if the hot dog steals my wife?

AD EXEC
Oh, I love it!

BREWSTER
I come home, and she’s glowing. Happier than I’ve ever seen her. Radiant. And I say, “Good day?” And she says, “Twice as good.” “What’s that mean?” Then I see a used condom in our bed, but it’s like, two condoms, together, get it? Whoops, it’s that damn hot dog!

AD EXEC
I love it. That won’t play on television, but you’re getting into the spirit.

BREWSTER
Oh, sure. Maybe instead of the used condom, they get married. And we see me, outside the church, just drunk and crying and so forth.

AD EXEC
Are you comfortable putting your kids on camera?

BREWSTER
They’d love it!

AD EXEC
How about they choose the hot dog as their new father? With a close-up of your daughter spitting in your face.

BREWSTER
Haha! That damn hot dog! I can’t win! He’s got me beat like a dog!

AD EXEC
We can build to a final showdown between you and the hot dog. To air during a major TV event.

BREWSTER
The World Series, right? Folks will want to see the hot dog beat me on my home turf.

AD EXEC
Perfect. And we make it literal at that point, a literal fight between you and the Plumpems Double Decker. We hype it as the ultimate showdown. But the joke is you never lay a glove on the hot dog. It dominates you from the first second.

BREWSTER
The dog’s just beating me like a rented mule from square one.

AD EXEC
Making you look like a weak fool.

BREWSTER
A weak damn fool. A pathetic child.

AD EXEC
It’s slamming your face against the pavement.

BREWSTER
My parents are still alive. Let’s put them in the spot! They’re watching me, wincing, embarrassed. It’d be a hoot.

AD EXEC
Finally, the hot dog digs a shallow grave, tosses you in, and buries you.

BREWSTER I’m dead, and he won.

AD EXEC
You never had a chance. You’re shit, and this hot dog proved it.

BREWSTER
I gotta tell you, this just sounds like a lot of fun. I mean, the money y’all are offering me is generous, but I gotta say, I’d do it for free. I mean it just sounds fun!

AD EXEC
Let me suggest a provocative idea. What if you die?

BREWSTER
I thought that’s what we were talking about?

AD EXEC
No, I mean what if you … die?

BREWSTER
Oh, I see.

AD EXEC
We’ll have a beautifully dignified ceremony for you. Your kids will be taken care of. We’ll send them to a state college. If they want to attend a private college, they can put the tuition for state college toward the cost of the private college. Can your wife wear a hot dog blazer to the funeral? Your coffin will also be filled with Double Decker Hot Dogs. It’s kind of a final, so to speak, fuck you.

BREWSTER
Hell, I’ll do it. This is a great way to go. You know how many damn times I got hit on the head with a baseball? I’ve got the brain of an eighty year old. I been beaned so many times they call me Charlie Frijole. I’ve taken so many walks, they call me Immanuel Kant.

AD EXEC
He went on lots of walks! We’re also gonna need you to rap.

BREWSTER
I love to rap! My lyrics aren’t the best, but I’ve got distinctive flow. Give me a beat and I’ll show you!

AD EXEC
Doug?

[ Adam returns with guitar. ]

ADAM
I’m not Doug!

AD EXEC
Doug … Remember how it made you feel when I called you “Doug?”

ADAM
It made me feel pretty fucking shitty. Let me tell you something--

[ Courtney raises a finger to hush him, then points at his guitar. ]

COURTNEY
No … Tell me with this.

[ Adam looks surprised, then pleased. He makes an angry face and plays an angry percussive rhythm on the guitar. ]

CURTIS
Well my name is rappin’ Brewster and I’m here to say
It’s time for the next sketch in a major way

[ Curtis and Adam begin to disperse, but Courtney stops them. ]

COURTNEY
No … No. Not good enough. We have to at least pretend it makes sense. That’s the joke.

[ They think for a moment. ]

CURTIS
We might as well get dressed.

[ They change a garment. ]

COURTNEY
Wait. I’m an ad exec. What if I say, “Want to stick around and help me review these showcase reels?”

CURTIS
“Review them? Let’s become then!”

COURTNEY
Yes! And then I say, “Why not?”

Steve! Your video games are taking up too much room!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve! Our phone bill is due and you bought a motorcycle!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve! I’m late for my pole dancing class and it’s your fault! I do it for exercise, not for any other reason!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

STEVE
It’s not because you don’t make me feel sexy anymore, Steve! It’s not because of that!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, get your drum kit out of the living room, I’m having an orgy later today!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

[JENNIFER addresses the audience]


JENNIFER
Hi, I’m a successful commercial actress and this is my reel. I’ve spent the last 15 years building a reputation as the best commercial housewife, commercial nagging girlfriend and commercial wife-who-doesn’t-get-it in the industry. Sometimes I get parts in movies as a confused prostitute or a dumb woman who has lots of sex and that’s when I really get to stretch my wings. But that doesn’t happen very often. Like barely ever and if I do get one of those jobs it gets cut down so much that I’m just in one scene where I’m asleep in the cab of a truck in the background of a fight. During one of these grueling all day shoots I got the idea to write this showcase piece, a succinct, all-encompassing part that truly shows my range.

STEVE
Yes dear.

[ DINKY COMMERCIAL MUSIC restarts ]

JENNIFER
Steve, you parked your jet ski in the house.

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, you went to the hardware store and bought 15 chainsaws again, you fucking idiot!

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, I’m going to leave you for our son’s kindergarten teacher. He’s a real man who takes care of shit and has a huge dick.

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
STEVE!

[JENNIFER slaps the newspaper out of his hand. STEVE gets up and addresses the audience]

STEVE
Hi, I’m a successful commercial actor and this is my reel. I’ve spent the last 10 years building a reputation as the best confused husband, the best dumb husband, the best husband-who-doesn’t-understand-phone-bills, the best husband-with too-many-hobbies and the best dim-witted boyfriend in the commercial industry. When I’m in a movie usually I play a well rounded person with hopes and dreams and feelings and my acting work receives accolades but I prefer commercials because I get to sit down in them. So I decided I’d put together a reel of my best work.

JENNIFER
Steve! This is my reel. We’re showcasing MY work.

STEVE
Yes, dear.

[ STEVE winks at the audience. STEVE and JENNIFER freeze. ADAM walks out. ]

[ DINKY COMMERCIAL MUSIC restarts ]

ADAM
Hi, I’m Adam. This is my editing reel. I have Final Cut Pro on my MacBook. It’s a copy my dad bought but he doesn’t use it so he lets me borrow it. My actor friends pay me $50 to cut their reels together. It usually takes 2-3 months because I forget about it and then I lose my computer for a few days and then I fall asleep after I get home from work every day for a few weeks and then I go out of town and then I got allergies real bad. My favorite thing to edit, though, is dog commercials. Oh wow, have you ever heard the story of Dr. Buddy? Well, I’ll tell you….

[ Sits in a chair and takes out a big book called “The Tale of Dr. Buddy”. He opens his mouth wide, like he is talking, and holds it so. ]

[ Courtney as a director, Curtis as a casting agent. ]

CURTIS [ pulling a couple of photos out of a file ]
So … it’s down to either Roger or … Dr. Buddy.

COURTNEY
Roger, or ….

CURTIS
Dr. Buddy.

COURTNEY
Roger was the … the …


CURTIS
Spaniel.

COURTNEY
Oh, yeah. The spaniel. Roger. Good dog. Such a good dog. Such a sweet boy.

CURTIS Such a sweet boy. Now, Dr. Buddy was the--

COURTNEY [ wistful, worshipful ]
--Lab! Jesus, that lab. Dr. Buddy. I mean, Jesus.

CURTIS
An impressive dog.

COURTNEY [ still worshipful ]
Jesus, are you kidding me? Dr. Buddy. I swear to god.

CURTIS
So, it’s a tough choice. Roger’s a very good boy.

COURTNEY
Such a sweetie.

CURTIS
On the other hand …

COURTNEY [ bewildered ]
Dr. Buddy ….

CURTIS
Roger’s reliable. He’s a good boy. He’ll jump on the table. He’ll tackle the bad guy. He’ll lick the bunny’s head without biting. You’re not going to get a lot of blown takes with Roger.

COURTNEY
Roger’s a good boy, isn’t he? Isn’t he? What a good dog.

CURTIS
Casting Roger gets this movie wrapped on time and on budget.

COURTNEY
Can Roger sit and stay? Yes he can. Can Roger do a trick? Yes he can. He’s a very good dog.

CURTIS
And then … Dr. Buddy.

COURTNEY
The camera loves Dr. Buddy.

CURTIS
But can he keep it together for an entire shoot?

COURTNEY
There’s something about Dr. Buddy.

CURTIS
You can almost get lost in his eyes.

COURTNEY
He’s raw and untested. There’s a fire within him. You can tell that this dog is … real, and dangerous. Things happened to him. No one gave him any treats until … One day … He found that he had a strange power over people.

CURTIS
Real charisma.

COURTNEY
Bitches want to breed with him. Dude dogs want to be him.

CURTIS
Dr. Buddy is the life of the party, without trying. You never see him trying. It comes naturally.

COURTNEY
His charisma is generous. He carries it lightly.

CURTIS
It’s why bitches want to breed with him.

COURTNEY
But the danger! The passions that run hot. The bark. The bite. And then … the petulance. The melancholy. Long mornings sulking in the kennel.

CURTIS
But … Roger is a good dog. Just a real good dog. And a sweet boy, such a sweet boy.

COURTNEY
He is. He is!

CURTIS
I knew this would be tough, so I invited a real average American to share his feelings.

[ Adam enters as an average American. ]

ADAM
Someone told me I could get a Quizno’s coupon by sharing an opinion about a dog?

COURTNEY
That’s right. We’re going to show you some photos, and you tell us what you think. OK?

ADAM
OK! My opinions are great, so you won’t be disappointed.

ADAM
Aw, what a good boy!

Aw, hey fella! Nice fella! What a nice fella.

ADAM
Aw, come here, mister guy! Mister fluffy little guy!

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Dr. Buddy. ]

ADAM
Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. I gotta … I gotta … Who is that dog??

CURTIS
Choose carefully, sir. This is no ordinary dog role. This is for the most anticipated dramatic program of the television season-decade.

ADAM
Oh my god, are you talking about--

[ Courtney slaps Adam, then makes the hush gesture. Adam is happy, points to his face. ]

ADAM
Yes!! That?! That! Yes!

[ Courtney and Curtis start getting ready for the Slap sketch, while Adam gets into position by the downstage mic. He pulls out his cell phone and pretends to call someone. ]

ADAM
Oh my god, mom! Is this mom? My mom? I knew it! You’re never gonna believe what just--Mom? Wait, then who’s mom are you, anyway? Don’t talk to me that way! I’m your son, that’s who. No? Then why does it say “Mom” by your name in my phone? What? Oh, never mind, I was just stalling anyway.

OLD MAN [ drinking ]
You know, I’ve been through lots of shit I don’t like to talk about. I’ve lost friends. I’ve … disappointed people. That stuff that’s supposed to come easy for everyone, getting your life together, finding someone to be with, it’s not easy for me. That’s just the way it is, I guess. I do OK, though. I try to stay curious. Do a lot of reading. Take roadtrips, when I can. I don’t think I’ll ever get to that bad place, you know, where it feels like there’s no way out. Let me tell you something. I know it’ll sound completely nuts, and … it is, but it’s the good kind of nuts. The kind that keeps you going when you’d rather give up. I was born in 1957. The same year that Sputnik launched. You know, that Russian satellite? Beep … beep … beep. Of course, with the Berlin Wall down, it seems silly now, but at the time it freaked people out. And when I get down … sometimes, it feels like I’m drifting through space … and I think about Sputnik. And it makes me glad to know he’s still up there, surfing on that cosmic wave. As long as you’re up there, buddy … I’m down here.

[ Takes a drink. ]

VOICE [ offstage ]
It burnt up in the earth’s atmosphere in 1958.

OLD MAN
What?

[ ROBOT enters. The robot is played by a performer holding an iPad in front of their face, which is showing the other performer Skyping in from backstage. ]

VOICE
It was up for three months.

OLD MAN
What the hell do you know? You’re just a person’s brain that’s been downloaded to a damn machine!

VOICE
I have instant access to databases crammed with hard facts!

OLD MAN
Why didn’t they attach that damn screen to your head? You’re hands are always full. You can’t even bring me a damn newspaper. Damn it!

VOICE
Sputnik was never meant to be a long-term thing.

[ It finally hits him. ]

OLD MAN
Oh … Jesus.

VOICE
Oh my god. I’m sorry. I just wanted to give you the correct information … I didn’t think about how it would make you feel. Living in this body … It’s turned the digital imprint of my memories, the electrical impulses that made up my soul … It’s turned them half-machine.

OLD MAN
Sputnik … We lost you, buddy. We lost you.

VOICE
What price immortality? I now reclaim my humanity. I choose to die.

[ Hangs up. ]

OLD MAN
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuugh! OK. OK. This is OK. This is OK. It was just a satellite. All right. Stay busy. Do something with your hands. Gotta write an email.

[ Computer-face sits across from him, continues to hold iPad up to face. Old Man starts trying to type out an email on the iPad face, which is difficult to do. ]

OLD MAN
You seriously can’t just hand that over to me for a minute?

[ Computer-face shakes head “no.” ]

Sometimes, these modern conveniences seem more like modern inconveniences! Now let’s write this email … oooo TED talks! I love TED talks! Let’s watch a TED talk right now!

[ Curtis and Adam exit. ]

[ SCIENCE INTRO plays ]

VOICE
Welcome to the stage, everyone’s favorite pop scientist: Marnie McFarnie Barnes!

[ MARNIE enters. ]

MARNIE
We’re all here because we love science. We love science. We love thinking about science, we love talking about science, we love finding ways to justify our life choices through science.

[holds for applause]

But science is mysterious and mystifying to most of us, right? Atoms, molecules, cells? What does any of it mean? Bwah!

[mimes juggling and dropping stuff]

That’s why I, the foremost “cool scientist” in my field, work so hard to bring science to the masses, to make science accessible to everyone. Science shouldn’t just be for blowhards and people with glasses! It should be for cool kids, women, real estate agents, black people and construction workers alike.

And what does everyone, regardless or race or gender or stereotype, have in common? Basketball. We all love basketball and we all understand things better when they are put in basketball terms.

I’m going to answer a few questions that were submitted during my Reddit AMA last week.

[picks up a card]

“Marnie, I can’t seem to wrap my head around string theory. Is there an easy way to understand it?”

Yes, there is. You can try this at home. Take two basketballs and tie them together with a string. Now you can see that the basketballs are one dimensional with no height or width, therefore supporting the ten-dimensional theory!

[holds for applause. Picks up another card]

“Marnie, is it possible that the bones of prehistoric creatures were put on earth by the devil to test our faith?”

No. Basketball no.

[picks up another card]

“Marnie, in the Kobayashi Maru…” Goddammit.

[picks up another card]

“Marnie, I understand that evolution has created all the creatures we know of today, but I just don’t understand how a monkey could change into a person.”

Alright “HornyHanSolo2344”, it’s just not that simple. A coconut doesn’t just one day turn into a basketball. Over millions and millions of years only the best coconuts would be chosen to play the ancient Pacific Islander game that would one day become basketball. The roundest, largest coconuts were chosen and bred specifically for this purpose. Then they were bred for their bounciness, for their orangeness, for their pebbled skin until gradually the perfect basketball tree was created….”

BASKETBALL DUDE [from the audience]
I have a question.

MARNIE
I will take audience queries in a moment.

BASKETBALL MAN
Why would a brilliant basketball scientist free throw everything beautiful in her life away, everything meaningful and special because she was too focused on her career?

MARNIE
Who is that?

BASKETBALL MAN [coming onstage]
It’s your basketball team mate. One basketball plus one basketball equals love.

MARNIE
What are you doing here?

BASKETBALL MAN
Pleading with you to give our marriage a second chance. I even brought the kids.

[two basketballs bounce on stage]

MARNIE
That was a long time ago, when I used to tutor you, using basketball to help you understand math, physics, literature, French….

BASKETBALL MAN
Je jou le basket.

MARNIE
Everything was so simple then! It’s too complicated now! I’m a big science star! I have to spend a lot of time on Twitter!!

BASKETBALL MAN
It can be simple again! Come with us! We’ll make basketball love like we used to.

MARNIE
You’re right. This doesn’t make me happy! This doesn’t fulfill me! Explaining the every aspect of science in basketball terms is draining and soul crushing.

[to the audience]

You’re all simpletons who will never understand science no matter how many “science is the fucking coolest” blogs you subscribe to. The universe is unknowable, mutha fuckas!

ADAM

[ While he acts a fool, Curtis and Courtney re-enter and take their places from the intro. ]

COURTNEY
It’s crazy to think of all the things that we’re gonna do when we leave sketch comedy behind.

CURTIS
That’s what we just did. That’s what this whole show was.

ADAM
Yeah. I wonder if it was too honest. I wonder if we exposed too much.

CURTIS
I feel like Prince, in Purple Rain. Right after he sings “Purple Rain”.

COURTNEY
And he thinks he went too far.

ADAM

[ Music from video continues as we set up for the first sketch. ]

[ LIGHTS UP on A MAN AND WOMAN SITTING TOGETHER, presumably in a park or something. They are in mid-conversation. ]

MAN:
But I know my job, right? So what's he doing--

WOMAN:
Yeah.

MAN:
He's talking to me. He's in my face, but he's not--

WOMAN:
Well, you let it bother you too much.

MAN:
He's the last guy that needs to be pointing fingers, though. I mean, if anyone's going to--

[ A VENDOR ENTERS. He is carrying a trash bag with something inside of it about the size and shape of a dead baboon. ]

VENDOR:
Pardon me, ma'am? Sir?

MAN:
Yes?

VENDOR:
Excuse me. Believe me when I say that I am well aware of the breach in the etiquette of the commonplace I am here and now committing. It is not typically my way, indeed, to impose myself in this manner upon two companionable gentles engaged in spirited and enriching discourse. But this deviation of mine is not made lightly. It is made, rather, with a kind of urgency -- though nothing akin to the urgency of a drowning man, something like the urgency of Spanish partisan, after the sun has fallen, discovering no honey in his hipside canteen.

MAN:
Excuse me?

VENDOR:
Urgency, I say, because the proposal I shall make to you two shall not long be fresh, I may say. It sits on the vine, shall we say, like a ripe tomato and, as I say and you too might say and, I hope, we would then be in agreement, it must be plucked and purchased while its hour is right. I hope you do not find me unreasonable.

[ Pause. ]

VENDOR:
But my preamble grows wearisome. Would you, dear sir and dear lady, care to touch a dead baboon?

[ Pause. ]

VENDOR:
Have I shot off the mark?

WOMAN:
Is this some kind of joke?

VENDOR:
No joke, ma'am. The deceased baboon lies in this receptacle and ready for your hands' appraisal.

[ Pause. Man is flabbergasted. ]

WOMAN:
Did you say baboon?

VENDOR:
Baboon, ma'am, I said. Of the primate order.

WOMAN:
Dead baboon?

VENDOR:
Entirely. And recently. Thus the aforesaid urgency. Were there any attraction in touching a baboon that had been long dead, I have not in my life encountered the man or woman who felt it.

[ Pause. ]

MAN:
Well, I just don't know.

WOMAN:
How do we know you have a dead baboon?

MAN:
Good question. Good question.

VENDOR:
On that score I will require your trust, dear lady.

WOMAN:
Can I look?

MAN:
Can we look?

VENDOR:
I'm afraid not. It is the practice of some tradesmen to allow customers to sample their wares. Each must decide for his or her self whether such sampling can be part of a sustainable business model. For me, ma'am, it cannot. Too many patrons would be fully satisfied with a glimpse and then find no need to pay for a subsequent touch. If the reason behind your requested peek is that you believe it unlikely that I have a dead baboon, I can only say this: it is not so unlikely. There are many baboons, and baboons die.

WOMAN:
But can I just look instead of touch?

VENDOR:
I'm afraid not.

WOMAN:
I'd rather just look.

MAN:
Why would you just want to look?

WOMAN:
Well, I just want to look at first, and then maybe--

VENDOR:
Dear madam, I may take your preferences into consideration, in aggregate with the suggestions of other customers, when I muse on changes to my business model. "Perhaps a new bag?" "Perhaps the introduction of a uniform of some kind" -- for myself, not the baboon, you understand -- "would attract a wider customer base." However, you can hardly expect me to implement changes to the model in the midst of our current transaction. For now, the product is the product, to wit -- one touch of a dead baboon, priced three dollars.

WOMAN:
Three?

VENDOR:
Three. Calculated so as to include state sales tax and all applicable fees.

WOMAN:
I don't think I have three dollars cash on me.

VENDOR:
Oh, dear.

WOMAN:
I've got one, definitely.

VENDOR:
I cannot negotiate the price, ma'am.

MAN:
I have three dollars and I am willing to spend them!

WOMAN:
Honey, I want to touch it.

MAN:
No deal. I've only got the three bucks myself.

WOMAN:
Honey, I've never touched anything dead bigger than a small cat.

MAN:
Is that what this is about?

WOMAN:
Just give me two bucks.

MAN:
Is this really about Lord Fuzzington? Still? After six years? Really?

WOMAN:
Well, what's the biggest corpse you've touched?

MAN:
Irrelevant.

WOMAN:
Biggest dead thing.

[ Pause. ]

MAN:
I had a friend who worked in a hospital. One time he snuck me into the morgue, but I didn't touch--

WOMAN:
OK, but you were close, right?

MAN:
Honey, it was kind of a disappointment. But this is awesome. Because I really, really hate baboons.

VENDOR:
Sir, ma'am, the time presses ...

WOMAN:
You were close. That counts.

MAN:
It does not count!

WOMAN:
It does.

MAN:
Who says it counts?

WOMAN:
I say it counts.

MAN:
You don't get to make up the counting rules.

WOMAN:
I'm better at counting.

MAN:
Bullshit.

[ Pause. They both start counting to ten. Woman gets there first. ]

MAN:
Damn it!

WOMAN:
Look, you had your chance in that morgue and you chickened out. You could've touched a dozen dead bodies that night. You could've waltzed one around the room and played Weekend at Bernie's. For Christ's sake, you could've leaned right down and given one of those fat dead bastards a raspberry. But you didn't. Now this is my shot, and I want to take it.

[ Pause. ]

MAN:
Can we both touch it?

VENDOR:
No sir, you cannot.

MAN:[ Looking at Woman ]
Can I touch it and describe it to you?

VENDOR:
No sir, you cannot.

MAN:
I'm touching it!

WOMAN:
Come on. No fair.

MAN:
No fair? What's no fair?

[ She pouts adorably. ]

MAN:
Come on. Don't give me the lower lip thing.

[ She sticks out her lower lip. ]

MAN:
You owe me.

[ Man hands over two dollars. Woman very methodically adds it to her one and passes the stack to Vendor, who pockets it and opens the bag a little. ]

VENDOR:
At your leisure, madam. Please give it a full tactile inspection, but respect the bounds of our agreement and do not peer inside.

[ Woman reaches in and moves her hand around, briefly. Pause. ]

WOMAN:
OK. I think I might be getting some butt. Cool.

[ She withdraws it. Vendor closes the bag. ]

VENDOR:
I wish the both of you an extremely pleasant afternoon and evening. It has truly been an honor doing business with you.

[ Vendor EXITS. A very long and awkward pause. Woman sighs. Man reaches for her hand. She withdraws it. He pouts. She offers him a finger to smell. He sniffs it and retches violently. LIGHTS OUT. ]

PAROLEE:
First, let me say it's been a real pleasure. I know this is my first meeting, but I've really enjoyed coming here and "putting my feet up" with you good folks at the Ottoman Club. Jerry, your cookies were delicious. Margaret, I'm glad we got to chance to talk about your grandson. I think that you're right. I think that he should reconsider college.

[ Beat. ]

I've got a confession to make. It's a touch awkward perhaps, but you folks have been so welcoming, and I think I'd be remiss in not being fully honest with you. I was not excited about attending this meeting. You see folks, for many years I was on the wrong side of the law. Got myself into some bad situations with drugs and that led me to make some mistakes and throw part of my life away. I'm happy to say that I am clean now. I've paid my time and I'm ready to make a fresh start.

Anyhow, my parole officer, he has some what you'd call progressive ideas about rehabilitation. He requires me to attend community functions, social gatherings, events where I might form new connections rather than being alienated from civil society. I was skeptical. I just chose this club randomly from a list of approved community events. Truthfully, I don't even own an ottoman of my own, which is why I brought the orange crate ... sort of a last-minute thing.

[ Beat. ]

I want you to know that I like what I see so far--really, just very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the subject, the history, the sense of community in this room. It's clear that you guys really love ottomans, and your enthusiasm is certainly infectious. You can definitely expect me at that next meeting.

[ Applause. Parolee sits. The man stands. ]

MAN:
Well, whatever path brought you here, Tony, we hope it keeps you with us, because the pleasure is all ours.

[ Applause. The man pulls out an index card. ]

I was wondering if anyone had extra ottomans in certain styles that they're looking to sell? I'm moving into a new place, and there are some pieces I'd like to accompany my new furniture.

[ Sighs. Puts cards away. Sighs. ]

Tony, you shared with us. Let me share with you.

[ Beat. ]

I had everything that men dream about. Beautiful wife. Amazing kids. Great job, great house. I couldn't enjoy it. Because it was all a lie, you see.

[ Beat. ]

From my teenage years on, I knew that I was a gay man, but I tried to hide it. I hid from my mom, the devout churchgoer ... my dad, mister macho army captain. I got so good at hiding it that I managed to hide it from myself, my wife, and my own children for the better part of twenty years. But then, six months ago, something snapped, and I couldn't live with the lie anymore.

[ Applause. ]

So I told her. I had to be honest with her. And she was so incredible about it. She said it always felt like there was something between us, and she was glad to finally know. And even though it ended our marriage, that marriage has turned into this unbelievable friendship. I've never felt closer to her than I do now.

[ Beat. ]

My kids just seemed relieved, like it was no big deal, and they wanted me to just get over it. Danny, my youngest, he teases me a little, of course, but I figure that's the least he can do.

[ Beat. ]

Until yesterday, the only people who still didn't know were my parents. I had no idea how they would take it, but they really surprised me. My dad was quiet for a moment, and then started saying he knew guys in the service who were "like that," and they could kill Charlie as well as anyone else, so they were okay by him. My mom asked a lot of questions -- some of them weren't exactly PC -- but she was just trying to understand in her own way.

[ Beat. ]

I've always liked ottomans. The feel of a good ottoman beneath my feet has always been a comfort. But until now, I've never known what it meant to really, truly put my feet up. Now I know. Now I know.

[ Applause. ]

So, anyhow, I am moving into a new place. And I will need to replace some of the ottomans that Sheila and the kids are keeping.

[ He passes the card to the old woman, who looks it over and passes it to the parolee. He shrugs. ]

Well, you know, if you hear anything....

[ He sits. A beat. The old lady stands up. ]

OLD LADY:
After a long struggle, Harold, my beloved husband of over fifty years, succumbed to death last Thursday.

[ Beat. Applause. ]

Naturally, I grieve for his loss. Harold and I shared everything during our many years together. The joy of watching our children grow, the disappointment of learning that our lives would not always be what we had dreamed in our idealistic youth.

[ Beat. ]

There have been times of tragedy in my life. When you live to be as old as me, you get used to being surrounded by death. In many ways, death becomes your most constant companion.

[ Applause. ]

But losing Harold is something quite different. It's like losing my foundation. Sometimes I worry that I'm going to crumble. And I don't want to crumble. I know I don't have much time before I follow him, and I know he wouldn't want me living that time like a broken woman.

[ Beat. ]

At a time like this, you need something solid under your feet. And I thank god that I have that, at least.

[ She pats her ottoman. Applause. She sits.

Pause. The parolee stands again. ]

PAROLEE:
Jerry, Margaret, It may sound crazy to say it, but I truly believe that the best people in the entire world are in this room right now, talking about ottomans.

OLD WOMAN:
Tony, it doesn't sound crazy.

MAN:
It doesn't sound crazy at all.

MARTIN
So I looked Jerry right in the face and I told him, "Listen, Jerry. It's not that I expect to make partner this year, or even next year. But I want to talk about what my future at the firm looks like."

CHARLES
Well, good for you.

MARTIN
I know how the game is played. No one gives it to you; you have to show that you're willing to step up and take it.

CHARLES
That's partly true, but don't push too hard. The old boys also want to see that you can be patient.

MARTIN
Charles, that might've worked for you, but it's a different story with me.

CHARLES
How's that?

MARTIN
I wasn't born with a lot of connections. I never went to any Ivy League yacht parties. They're not going to just hand it to me.

CHARLES
Like they handed it to me, you mean?

MARTIN
Aw, Charles, that's not what I meant--

CHARLES
Martin, you're a bright young attorney with a lot of talent. But you still don't know people all that well.

MARTIN
Charles--

CHARLES
Hold on. You think I never had to overcome anything?

MARTIN
I didn't--

CHARLES
Martin, let me tell you something. Something I've never told anyone before.

MARTIN
Charles, I don't want to make this some kind of big deal--

CHARLES
I'm a baby, Martin.

MARTIN
Pardon?

CHARLES
I suffer from a rare condition. From my outward appearance and composure, anyone would swear I'm a grown man. But technically, according to medical science, I am a baby.

MARTIN
I don't understand you.

CHARLES
Here.

[ He hands Martin his keys. ]

This might clarify things a bit. These are the keys to my Lexus. Now, shake them for me.

[ Beat. ]

Go ahead, just give them a bit of a jangle.

[ Martin shakes the keys a little bit. Charles laughs heartily, applauds. ]

Wonderful! A-ha! Smashing stuff, truly!

[ He takes his keys back. ]

See?

MARTIN
Charles, what are you trying to say? That you're actually under a year old?

CHARLES
Of course not. I'm fifty-seven years old. It's just that I'm a baby. According to medical science.

MARTIN
Says who?

CHARLES
Medical scientists!

MARTIN
Which medical scientists?

CHARLES
A team of the very best. They've been studying me since birth. I still visit them once a month for tests. It's our hope that rigorous study of my condition may eventually do humanity some good.

MARTIN
So you're fifty-seven years old.

CHARLES
That's correct.

MARTIN
And you look fifty-seven years old.

CHARLES
I can pass for forty-five in the right light.

MARTIN
And you think like one of the city's most successful intellectual property lawyers.

CHARLES
Well, you see, Martin, I have no understanding of language. I only mimic sounds that I hear in order to elicit positive responses. As for my job performance, think of it as just play at a very high level. Knocking the right shapes into the right holes, so to speak.

MARTIN
Because you're a baby.

CHARLES
Exactly, a baby.

[ Beat. ]

Try this. Put your hands over your face.

[ Beat. ]

Indulge me.

[ Martin does. Charles stands up and starts to look around. ]

Martin, where have you gone? Martin, come on now, we were right in the middle of a conversation!

[ Martin uncovers his face. Charles notices, chuckles, points. ]

Ah, there you are. Delightful!

[ Charles sits again. ]

MARTIN
So what is this? Some kind of prank? The old boys' way of hazing one of the young guys?

CHARLES
Martin, I'm a baby! Babies don't prank! For God's sake, I don't even have object permanence.

MARTIN
I don't appreciate this, whatever it is.

CHARLES
I don't know what you're talking about, Martin! I mean, I actually don't know what you're talking about or what any of the sounds you make really mean! Goo-goo ga-ga and all that, you know?

MARTIN
Goodbye, Charles.

CHARLES
Why are you getting angry? Your emotions are strange and troubling to me. Oooooh, now I feel myself becoming upset as well.

MARTIN
Goodbye, Charles.

[ He leaves. ]

CHARLES
Come back! I don't want you to leave! I want you to come back! This is not the way I want things to be!

[ LIGHTS UP on a WRITER at a typewriter or keyboard or just pretending to type in the air ]

WRITER:
Where do I begin? How do I describe my time with the master? With Mr. Stanislav Actislavski himself? I certainly had heard whispers of him in the high school drama room, but we had no need for acting styles with our half-cocked restagings of Our Town and Carousel. I heard rumblings of him in my college drama courses and during load ins, but we paid little attention to old masters while staging our crude, gender challenging modernizations of Euripides and Aristophanes. But the first time I saw one of his pupils on the silver screen, I was entranced. The rawness, the vulnerability was seeping from the rafters of the theater and I could only think one thing: "Who taught him how to do that?" I made my way to the village where Master Activslavski kept his small, no 

[ WRITER backspaces ] 

modest teaching space and theater. I remember my first interaction with him as if it were yesterday. By the time I met him he was 95 years old but still sharp as a tack. 

[ The scene seamlessly melds into an interaction between STANISLAV ACTISLAVSKI and WRITER. STANISLAV ENTERS using a cane and only yells in a monotone. WRITER kneels before STANISLAV. ]

STANISLAV:
Don't kneel, you imbecile. Get up! So, you want to be an actor. 

WRITER:
Yes, master. Very much.

STANISLAV:
Don't call me master, what are you a dog?

WRITER:
Yes, master.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
There's nothing very special about you. You're not particularly good looking, not particularly charismatic or interesting....What's your name, boy?

WRITER:
Daniel, master. 

STANISLAV:
Daniel, there is a coffee shop in the Bronx called Great Joe's Adventure Cafe and Muffler Repair. Do you know it? Bring me a small black coffee from there by the time my next class starts and I will bring you on as my apprentice.

[ WRITER RETURNS to his writing station while STANISLAV gets ready for his acting class he's about to teach ]

WRITER:
And get that small cup of coffee I did. And many more following that. Sure, it was a two hour round trip subway ride each day for what all I could figure was a slightly less than mediocre small cup of coffee. And sometimes I'd have to go twice a day, leaving me to wonder why he didn't just order a large cup of coffee on the first trip. But it was worth it. I learned so much under the master. I learned that he'd been hit by a freight train while still living in Russia and that's why he used a cane. I learned that he'd lost the use of his normal speaking voice whilst traveling to the states by boat and had to yell everything he said. I learned the true root of human need and how to touch the ET inside. ET, that's what ACTISLAVSKI called your "emotion tip". Everyone has one.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I need you!

[ WRITER EXITS, picks up a coffee from offstage and ENTERS in as if he's late for class ]

WRITER:
I'm sorry, Master, there was a MTA strike. I had to walk the whole way.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, get on the stage with Anna.

[ ANNA ENTERS from the audience, as if she's in the class ]

STANISLAV:
Do you think Anna's attractive?

DANIEL: [ embarrassed ]
Uh, yeah.

STANISLAV:
You're wrong. She's just as boring and unattractive as you are. Let's see if we can't breathe some life into you two turds on a log. Look at her. Really look into her eyes. Say what you see.

DANIEL:
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
No, no, no, no! Don't talk to her! Don't speak directly to her! Like she's a person! She's not a person!

DANIEL: [ dismissively ]
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
Very nice! How did that feel?

DANIEL:
Good, uh, really good.

STANISLAV:
Anna. Look into Daniel's eyes. Say what you see.

ANNA:
You seem pensive.

STANISLAV:
Oh, god. Boring! That is the most boring thing I have ever heard. Listen, when are you people going to learn? 

[ STANISLAV addresses the class/audience and then conducts them like an orchestra ]

STANISLAV, DANIEL, ANNA:
Touch the ET inside.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
Thank you! Anna, try again.

ANNA:
You seem........pensive?

STANISLAV:
Finally! How was that for you?

ANNA:
I, uh, really felt my ET.

STANISLAV:
Good, good girl. I think you've really learned something today. I think you might have had a breakthrough. In fact, you get to start doing face ups. Daniel, sit here.

[ DANIEL sits next to STANISLAV ]

STANISLAV:
Now Anna, I want you to kneel on the ground. Good. Put your face up. Okay. Now I want you to think of the most painful thing that could ever happen to you. You got that?

[ ANNA nods ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Now multiply that times 43. You should really feel your ET growing. It should feel like it's just touching the inside of your ribs. It should grow and grow till you feel it pushing on the walls of your chest and then it will feel like it's going to poke out of your heart.

[ ANNA is on the floor, weeping ]

STANISLAV:
Good, good, that's enough for today. 

[ ANNA goes back to her seat, sniffling ]

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I want you to get up and do a window. Did you bring your Cleaning Object?

DANIEL: [ taking out a handkerchief ]
Yes.

STANISLAV:
Tell me about it.

DANIEL:
It was my Grandfather's. My Grandmother kept it on her at all times after he died. Then, after she died, I got it.

STANISLAV:
I asked you to bring in something personal.

DANIEL:
But my Grandfather...

STANISLAV:
I heard what you said. It needs to be something personal. I'm looking for the towel you used to clean the blood off your face after that drunken fight. Or that shirt you were wearing when you first banged that really hot piece of ass you'd been wanting for months. What's this, a rag your Grandpappy carried around with him? Crap. [ pause ] It will have to do for today. Do your window.

[ DANIEL mimes wiping a window ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. You want to clean the window without really touching it. Really connect with your cleaning object. Stop.

[ DANIEL stops ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. [ slowly as if speaking to someone who is hard of hearing ]Clean it.
[ DANIEL starts the wiping motion again ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Good, Daniel.

[ DANIEL returns to his typing chair while STANISLAV continues the class like his still there ]

DANIEL:
The things I learned. I learned that people don't have brown eyes, they have 

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes. And people don't seem pensive. They seem....pensive? I learned how to stop wiping windows and start CLEANING windows. And you know what else. I got to deliver the eulogy at the old man's funeral. He hasn't died yet, but he figured he'd have a funeral while most of the people he knew were still alive. You know what else? I married that girl with the

brown eyes.

It's good that we're friends. Having friends is good. Strangers? No thank you. Acquaintances? Who are you kidding? Family? Get lost. But friends like us. We can tell anything to one another. It's just good that as friends we have that trust. Not only do we trust each other, we are compassionate and understanding. We have fun. We have fun when we are together and we are friends.

It's a very exciting event. We've got a lot of performers in from all over the country, and beyond.

JOEL:
I bet a lot of them got here on the finest mode of transportation available to us: the airplane.

CURTIS:
Oh man, I've had some pretty frustrating times in airports.

 JOEL:
We all have. With all those crazy characters and stuff that can happen.

Did I tell you what happened the last time I was at the airport?

You sure did. Man, that sounded like a real doozy of a situation.

CURTIS:
It was.

There was this guy there who had the craziest habit. It was a really funny, comical tic.

CURTIS:
Huh.

That sounds fun. Hey, did you hear about the latest foolish public utterance from a major political figure?

JOEL:
I sure did. I read about it in the paper.

CURTIS:
What? What??

JOEL:
I'm not sure. We greeted everyone. It felt introductory.

CURTIS:
Damn it. Maybe that was the pre-intro?

JOEL:
Is there a pre-intro on the list?

CURTIS:
I can't read it. It's dark.

JOEL:
Let's just keep going.

CURTIS:
We're already deviating from the list?

JOEL:
Just this once. Let's go to the first sketch.

CURTIS:
They're gonna know! They're gonna know!

JOEL:
They don't know. They don't even have a copy of the list.

CURTIS:
They can hear us.

JOEL:
No. The lights are down.

CURTIS:
Good point.

JOEL:
OK, let's move into the positions that we're in at the beginning of the first sketch. And don't forget to place any props that you might use in the sketch.

CURTIS:
OK, mom.

JOEL:
Don't disrespect me. Or your mother.

CURTIS:
OK. And then when the lights come up, we'll just start doing the sketch, right?

JOEL:
Right.

CURTIS:
OK.

JOEL:
OK, bye.

CURTIS:
Next time I see you, I'll be saying the words that we wrote down earlier as the script of the first sketch.

JOEL:
OK, bye.

CURTIS:
I just don't want you to think I'm acting weird.

JOEL:
OK. Bye.

CURTIS:
Bye!

JOEL:
Bye!

CURTIS:
Are you waving goodbye or just saying it? I can't see you. Would you like me to wave?

JOEL:

CURTIS:
OK, bye!

SKUNK PUSSY



[ LIGHTS UP ON A SHADY DEALER LEANING AGAINST THE WALL. MAN ENTERS and walks past the dealer. ]

DEALER
Hey, man.

MAN
Uh, good day to you.

DEALER
Whoa, hold on, man, hold on. You wanna get some skunk pussy, man?

[ Beat. ]

MAN
Do I what?

DEALER
Good stuff, man. Good stuff.

MAN
Good what?

DEALER
I ain't playing with you man. I got all the skunk pussy you need, man.

MAN
Did you say “skunk pussy”?

DEALER
Skunk pussy, man. Best skunk pussy you ever had.

MAN
I'm not sure what that is, but I feel very confident I don't want any.

DEALER
Believe me, man, the stuff I got – you want it.

MAN
I don't. If that's a metaphor, or a clever name or something, it's really poorly chosen. I think I'm pretty open to new experiences, but the name has put me off completely.

DEALER
I get it. I get it, man. You been around, clearly. You want to negotiate on price? I can negotiate.

MAN
I don't want it, whatever it is. It sounds unappealing.

[ Man starts walking, but the dealer intercepts him. ]

DEALER
Come on, man, just have some. First one's on me.

MAN
No.

DEALER
I'll give you five dollars, man. Just take some of this stuff.

MAN
No!

DEALER
Look, man, I'm up to my ears in this stuff. My wife's on my case to unload it. My marriage is in shambles, man. Help me out.

MAN
Look, it's not my problem.

DEALER
I had fucking T-shirts printed up, man.

[ The dealer pulls out a box, then pulls out a T-shirt with the words “SKUNK PUSSY” printed on the front. ]

I got like seven boxes of T-shirts and hoodies, man. What are you? Medium? Large? Take one of each, man. Try 'em both. No charge.

MAN
"Skunk Poosy?" Why the hell is it spelled like that?

DEALER
Come on man, kids love misspelling stuff, you know?

MAN
You're selling this shit to kids??

DEALER
Man, you sound just like my wife. Just take a shirt.

MAN
Not my problem, friend.

[ Tries to exit again, again is blocked by the dealer. ]

DEALER
Look, man, just do me a favor, all right? Let me give you some skunk pussy. You can just go around the corner and put it in the trash. Seriously, man. This is the worst business idea I ever had.

MAN
Why don't you just call it something else?

DEALER
Like what, man?

MAN
I don't know. “Good Luck Rainbow Torpedo.” Hell, I don't know. Anything.

[ Beat. ]

DEALER
That don't really capture the essence of the product, man.

MAN
What's the essence of the product?

[ Beat. ]

DEALER
You ever, like, accidentally drink some expired milk while stubbing your toe while the smell of sulfur is also in the air?

[ Beat. ]

MAN
Let's say yes.

DEALER
Imagine that feeling, but happening inside your heart and mind.

[ Beat. Man shakes his head and EXITS. Dealer shouts after him. ]

Well, of course it sounds bad when you say it!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]



SO WASTED




[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO FRAT BOYS SITTING SIDE BY SIDE in lawn chairs. Discarded beer cans and bottles all around them. ]

FRAT GUY 1:
Dude.

FRAT GUY 2:
That shit was unbelievable.

FG1:
It was out of control.

FG2:
No one could control shit like that.

FG1:
That was the most epic shit.

FG2:
That shit was Homeric.

[ Beat. ]

FG1:
Fuck.

FG2:
Fuckin' A right, dude.

[ Beat. ]

FG1:
So wasted.

FG2:
I fuckin' know, dude.

FG1:
I was so fuckin' wasted last night!

FG2:
I was fucked up, dude.

FG1:
We were both so fucked up.

FG2:
Everyone got fucked up at that party dude. Everyone.

FG1:
Epic.

[ Beat. They lock eyes, smile, and exchange a hive five. ]

BOTH:
Wooooooo!

FG1:
So wasted!

[ Beat. ]

FG2:
I think I puked twice, brah.

FG1:
I think I puked at least twice.

FG2:
I was so wasted.

FG1:
Totally.

FG2:
I was so wasted that Chad and I just sat in that couch in the backyard for like an hour. We talked about all the times we've seen together, the passing of our youth, what the future holds for us. And then we seemed to share this deep, silent understanding.

[ Pause. ]

FG1:
So wasted!

FG2:
I know, man! I fucking know!

FG1:
I was so wasted, I went and found Madison. She was outside with that new fucking tool boyfriend of hers. I took her aside and told her how I felt about our relationship. I told her I had let go of my anger because no matter how things fell out between us, I still owed her everything for the tender, innocent love we had shared. And then we held each other, as friends, for what seemed like forever.

[ Pause. Frat Guy 2 whoops and hollers, makes drinking gestures. They high five. ]

FG2:
So. Fucking. Wasted!

FG1:
I was demolished, dude!

FG2:
You were obliterated, dude!

FG1:
I was annihilated.

BOTH:
We both were!

[ Pause. ]

FG2:
Dude, I was so wasted that I called my father.

FG1:
Dude, you are nuts!

FG2:
I totally fucking did, dude! I called my father.

FG1:
You are a fucking animal, dude! You are a fucking mythic animal! You are a fucking gryphon!

FG2:
 I called my fucking father.


FG1:
Fuuuuuuuuck.

FG2:
That's not all, dude.

FG1:
That's not all? There's more?

FG2:
I called my father. And I forgave him.

[ Beat. ]

I forgave him.

[ Beat. ]

Right in his face.

[ Pause. Then an explosion of dudely spirits. ]

FG1:
FUCKING EPIC!

FG2:
FUCKING HISTORIC!

FG1:
SO!

FG2:
FUCKING!

FG1:
WASTED!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]



BAD COMEDIAN



[ LIGHTS UP. CURTIS IS SITTING ON STAGE, looking upstage.

COMIC ENTERS. He is incredibly nervous. His clothes resemble those of a Vaudeville comedian. He is wearing a large blue and white polka dotted bow-tie. He takes center stage. ]

COMIC
Ladies and gentlemen, I am a comedian.

[ He clears his throat. ]

My wife is such a slut. I mean, I had a wife who-- What I mean to say is, I can't get a good night's sleep because my slut wife likes to talk after sex. You try to sleep with the phone ringing all night.

[ Silence. After the punchline the large bow tie begins to spin. It is so big that it hits him in the face and is unable to spin. He awkwardly reacts. ]

My friend Eddie is grotesquely obese. He was at my home yesterday and I said, "Eddie, you're so fat the great state of Montana doesn't have the land mass or food available to sustain you."

[ Silence. After the punchline the large bow tie begins to spin. It is so big that it hits him in the face and is unable to spin. He awkwardly reacts. ]

I need a third joke to say here.

[ He extends his arms. Hopefully there will be silence. The large bow tie begins to spin. It is so big that it hits him in the face and is unable to spin. He awkwardly reacts. ]

So, did I get the gig?

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS
Yes, you did.

COMIC:
Yay.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]



CIGARS



[ LIGHTS UP ON TODD AND ED. ]

TODD:
Ed?

ED:
Yes, Todd.

TODD:
Something's missing.

ED:
Something's missing?

TODD:
Lately, I've felt like something's missing.

ED:
Did you retrace your steps?

TODD:
Something's missing from our lives. I'm twenty-seven years old.

ED:
As am I.

TODD:
We're adults.

ED:
By any measure.

TODD:
But I don't feel like an adult. I feel like a child.

ED:
Because something's missing.

TODD:
Precisely.

[ Beat. ]

ED:
Kids?

TODD:
God, no.

ED:
Marriage?

TODD:
Jesus Christ, no. I'm not ready for that.

ED:
Taking your job seriously?

TODD:
My nine to five doesn't define me.

ED:
A clean house?

TODD:
I told you I'd get around to it this weekend.

[ Beat. ]

ED:
You've stumped me. What's missing?

TODD:
Cigars.

ED:
Cigars?

TODD:
It's time for us to get into cigars.

ED:
That's it?

TODD:
"That's it"?

[ Todd pulls a cigar from his pocket, removes the wrapping, puts it in his mouth. ]

Old-fashioned sophistication. Masculine grace. A powerful smell. Yes, Ed, "that's it."

[ He tries to bite off the end of the cigar and spit it out. He bites off a little too much, ends up with flakes of tobacco on his tongue. ]

ED:
You don't smoke.

TODD:
I don't smoke. I smoke cigars.

ED:
Same thing?

TODD:
It is not. Cigarettes are for teenagers in baggy jeans and fat old sallow women tugging at Atlantic City slot machines. Cigars are for men. Men of wit and position. Rich, robust, oaky men.

[ Todd holds up a series of pictures of the following men. ]

Men like Mark Twain! Sigmund Freud! Mr. Spacely from The Jetsons!

ED:
Kid Rock.

TODD:
I'm sure I don't know who you're talking about.

[ Todd pulls out a lighter and lights the cigar. He takes a puff. ]

Watch that smoke curl, Ed. It's a diaphanous road to a vanished world of men.

[ Another puff. ]

A world where corpulent power brokers bathe in coal-heated wooden barrels. Where weighty affairs of state are settled over a hand-drawn map and two glasses of brandy. Where the sexual health of even the fanciest prostitute cannot be guaranteed.

[ Another puff. ]

Memories of empire!

ED:
Where did you get it?

TODD:
Behind the counter at the gas station.

ED:
Shell?

TODD:
Valero.

[ Pause. ]

It's pretty good.

ED:
How do you know?

TODD:
It cost four dollars. The other ones cost two or less.

[ He looks at the cigar. ]

How much longer do you think it'll last? One minute? Two?

ED:
You've got twenty minutes at least.

TODD:
Time enough to be a man.

[ He takes a another puff. ]

Let me just put this down for a moment.

[ He puts it down. ]

Needn't hurry the pleasure, after all. A man does not gulp from life's cup. He sips.

ED:
Todd.

TODD:
Edward?

ED:
Can I put out your cigar and throw it away?

[ Todd looks tempted. ]

TODD:
No ... no, you can't.

ED:
It smells like a burning vat of pubic sweat.

TODD:
As a man with a cigar, and therefore authority, I order you not to extinguish my cigar, the source of my authority.

ED:
All right.

[ Todd grabs the cigar. ]

TODD:
Cigar!

[ He holds it aloft. ]

While I was at Valero, I also picked this up.

[ He pulls out an issue of GQ Magazine. ]

Gentleman's Quarterly. Not some weekly rag. Though I be not of the gentry, the clerk must have spied that within mine eyes and gait which bespoke of some nobility, and thus allowed me purchase of this journal.

[ He opens it up. ]

Herein is the very chart of the fashionable man about town, a man who catches your eye and steals your focus, a man with ... a cigar!

[ Ed takes the magazine, flips to some articles. ]

ED:
Gentlemen seem to love ultimate fighting.

TODD:
A gentleman is sporting.

ED:
And body spray.

TODD:
Yet he is not afraid to put on the teasing airs of a dandy!

[ Todd takes another puff of the cigar, looks a little ill. ]

ED:
Doesn't that thing taste like crap?

TODD:
Nay! No more than life itself.

ED:
Put it out.

TODD:
Never.

ED:
Just put it out. I know where this is going, and I don't want you hosting weekly poker nights and puking scotch into the bathtub.

TODD:
I shall do all these things and more! I have been a boy too long! In Africa, they hunt lions with spears. The natives of this land wrestle with bears to prove their mettle. This is my rite de passage. This is my walkabout! I will smoke this cigar, and then I will smoke another! And then I will stand with broad shoulders and stride this earth as a man.

[ Ed grabs the cigar, snuffs it, and tears it in two. Then he slaps Todd.

Pause.

Todd picks up the GQ and starts flipping through its pages. ]

TODD:
How much do you think it would cost to get into motocross?

[ Beat. ]

I mean, seriously into moto--

[ Ed slaps Todd again, knocking him out of his chair.

LIGHTS OUT.]



CHANGE STORE



[ LIGHTS UP ON A CLERK wiping down a countertop. ]

CLERK:

Welcome to Quick Change. How may I be of assistance? Change for a twenty in coins? Mostly dimes, you say? Yessir!

[ PATRON ENTERS. ]

Welcome to Quick Change, sir. How may I change your day?

PATRON:
I just need some ones.

CLERK:
Excellent choice, sir.

PATRON:
Here's a five.

CLERK:
Delightful. And would sir prefer five ones?

PATRON:
Sure. That'll be fine.

CLERK:
The gentleman is not excited by the idea of five crisp dollar bills?

PATRON:
Well, honestly, no.

CLERK:
Perhaps three ones and eight quarters is more to your liking?

PATRON:
Eight quarters? Hmmm. You don't think that will be too much weight in one pocket?

CLERK:
Some prefer the constant solidity and heft of quarters. But, as they say, “to each his own. Would the gentlemen care to try the quarters on before the exchange is made?

PATRON
Yeah. Let me get a feel for 'em.

[ Patron takes the quarters and places them in his pocket. He walks around. ]

There seems to be a whole lot of jingling. I mean people on the street, in my office, they're going to hear this, and I don't want to seem like I'm showing off.

CLERK
A man of persistent modesty, I see. Perhaps, Sir could change his gait to silence his pocket change.

[ Patron tries different walks accompanied with commentary and suggestion from Clerk. ]

PATRON
No, I don't think I'll be able to keep this up all day. It's not going to work.

CLERK
Perhaps dividing the quarters amongst your pockets would make for a more comfortable tote.

[ Patron shifts the change to different pockets and paces. ]

PATRON
No, now they're rattling against my keys, and the ones in my back pocket just don't feel right at all.

CLERK
Say no more. Every problem is an opportunity in disguise. Let me see. Dimes are quite well known for their discretion of sound, and they are quite popular this season.

PATRON
I'm listening.

CLERK
Let us try this: three ones, four quarters, and ten dimes.

PATRON
Okay, so I'll keep the ones in my wallet...

CLERK
Naturally.

PATRON
the quarters in my pocket, and the dimes...

[ Pause. ]

PATRON
I could put them with the keys...

TOGETHER
...but the jingling.

CLERK
We do have quite a selection of coin carriers and pocket organizers. But the gentleman does not appear to be the sort for such novelty.

PATRON
Well I just don't know.

CLERK
Aha! We can use some kind of bonding agent, air-plane perhaps, and glue the change to your body making a kind of coin-robe.

PATRON
That's just stupid. Gimme the five one's.

CLERK
I'm sorry Sir must settle for paper currency, but you are the consumer and I am employed to fulfill your monetary needs.

[ Clerk hands Patron folded bills. ]

Have a delightful day.

PATRON
Thanks. You, too.

[ He walks away. ]

Hey, you shorted me.


[ He walks back. ]

I gave you a five and you gave me four ones.

CLERK
I'm sorry sir. May I see your receipt?

[ Beat. ]

BOTH:
Uh-oh!!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]




JACOWSKI AND REED



[ LIGHTS UP. JOEL AND CURTIS ENTER AS JACOWSKI AND REED. Reed is carrying a thick evidence file and a mostly eaten candy bar. ]

REED:
I'm telling you, Jacowski, this is it. This is all the evidence we need to break this case.

[ Reed pats the file. ]

JACOWSKI:
Reed, this better be good.

REED:
Don't worry, Jacowski.

JACOWSKI:
I mean good.

REED:
And what did I just say? Look, it's all in here. Not just the identity of the East Street Eviscerator. This describes a web of terror linking all major crimes in the past two years to single group of criminal masterminds. The missing squad cars, the restaurant fires, the prostitute gambling, the assassination of the deputy mayor. Everything. It's all connected!

JACOWSKI:
Thank god.

[ He turns to look out a window. ]

I've spent so many nights dreaming of this day, Reed. When we could stand before the few remaining good folks in this rotten bitch of a city and tell them that finally their nightmare is over. Finally, they can wake up in a city where justice still means something. A city they can raise their kids in without fear. A city that's not so much of a rotten bitch.

[ Reed finishes the candy bar, wads up the wrapper, and throws the file in a trash can. He places the wrapper in his pocket.

Jacowski turns around. ]

All right, let's see it.

[ Jacowski reaches out for Reed to hand him the file. Reed looks around. His expression changes to worried. He becomes frantic. ]

Jesus Christ, Reed.

REED:
I had it. I had it, like, ten seconds ago.

JACOWSKI:
What the hell?

[ Reed and Jacowski search the room but do not look in the trash can. ]

I told the commissioner we'd have arrest warrants by tomorrow.

REED:
Uhhh ... maybe you have it? Maybe?

JACOWSKI:
You put the whole thing together.

REED:
And then you took it?

JACOWSKI:
I did not take it!

[ Beat. ]

OK. When did you have it last? Retrace your steps.

[ Reed starts to stand up. ]

Mentally.

[ Reed sits down. ]

REED:
OK. I had it at my desk, I walked over here to talk to you, I passed the captain, then I set it on a table.

JACOWSKI:
You're positive you had it in here?

REED:
Absolutely.

JACOWSKI:
You didn't hand it to the captain?

REED:
No. But I told him it explained everything and that the reign of terror was over.

JACOWSKI:
You say you placed it on the table. On this table?

REED:
You see any other tables around?

JACOWSKI:
So you're saying you walked in the room with the file, spoke with the captain, and placed the file on this table.

REED:
That sounds right, but a piece is missing. Maybe I walked in, put the file down, and then I spoke with the captain.

JACOWSKI:
Would someone do that, though? You know, walk in here, put the file down, and then speak with someone outside the room?

REED:
Maybe. Maybe I'm the kind of person who would do that. You know, a loose cannon.

JACOWSKI:
Well, where would a loose cannon like you put an important document?

REED:
Goddamit, I don't know!

JACOWSKI:
Maybe holding something that resembles a file will help.

REED:
Good thinking.

JACOWSKI:
Thank you.

REED:
What should we use?

[ They look around the room searching for something to use. Jacowski looks in the trash can. ]

JACOWSKI:
Here's some trash.

[ JACOWSKI removes the file. ]

REED:
Wait a minute. Wait a minute... This should be in the recycling bin.

JACOWSKI:
Just take the damn thing.

[ Reed takes the file and walks to the door to reenact his entrance. As he reenacts he runs his hands over the file, thumbs through it quickly, etc. ]

REED:
I finished it at my desk while I was eating my candy bar. I picked up the file, tucked it under my arm, and walked down the hallway. I passed the captain and came in here. I finished my candy bar.

JACOSKI:
Then... you...

[ REED hits himself on the forehead with the file. ]

 REED:
What did I do with it? What did I do with it?

[ Jacowski takes the file from Reed. He raps his fingers on it. ]

JACOWSKI:
Where could it be?

[ Reed slowly pantomimes eating the candy bar and placing the wrapper in his pocket. ]

REED:
My pocket!

[ Reed puts his hands in his pockets and pulls out the candy bar wrapper. ]

Jacowski, I think this is it.

JACOWSKI:
I don't remember it being this small.

REED:
I'm pretty sure this is it.

JACOWSKI:
I think that's something else. I think that's the candy bar wrapper. 

REED:
We need to be absolutely positive, Jacowski.

JACOWSKI:
Let's think this one out. Let's make a list of all the ways this is like a file and all the ways this is like a candy bar wrapper. We'll find a sheet of paper and make two columns.

[ Jacowski flips trough the file and finds a sheet of paper. He removes a pen from a pocket and begins to write. ]

If we observe it to have qualities more like a candy bar wrapper we will record that specific detail in this column. If it resembles a file we record it here in this column.

REED:
Number one: It has writing on it. Similar to a file.

JACOWSKI:
Good. But, a candy bar wrapper also has writing on it.

REED:
You're right. Better put that in both columns.

JACOWSKI:
It has chocolate on it. That's something only a candy bar wrapper would have.

REED:
Not necessarily. What if you just ate a candy bar and then thumbed through a file,

[ He thumbs through the file. ]

then there would be chocolate on the pages of the file.

JACOWSKI:
True. But let's not outsmart ourselves here. Let's just stick to the facts. To what we know. This looks like a candy bar wrapper. It's small. A file would be more the size and shape of this.

[ Jacowski picks up the file. ]

REED:
But, it was in my pocket. A candy wrapper is trash. Why would I put trash in my pocket? That's where I would keep something important like a file.

JACOWSKI:
But files don't fit in a pocket.

REED:
Have you ever tried?

[ Beat. ]

JACOWSKI:
Hold on. Let me think this one out.

REED:
By all means.

JACOWSKI:
So if this,

[ Points to the file. ]

which is the size and shape of a file...

REED:
Which we established earlier...

JACOWSKI:
Fits into your pocket...

REED:
Then this...

[ He points to the wrapper. ]

... which was in my pocket ...

BOTH:
Must be the file!

[ REED tries cramming the file into his pocket. Eventually both men are trying to force the file into all of his pockets. They tear it apart and shove it's pieces into each of their pockets. ]

REED:
We did it! It fits!

JACOWSKI:
Reed, I've seen a lot of things on this job. Things no one should ever have to see. Things that made me wonder if I was losing my mind. But I'm certain of two things: that's the file, we're the best goddamn detectives in the world, and you .... you're my best friend.

REED:
Jacowski, that's three things.

JACOWSKI:
I never said I was the best mathmatist.

REED:
Come on, the judge is going to want to see this.

[ He looks at the wrapper. ]

You hear that bell, polysorbate? That's justice's bell. And it dings hard and dongs true. Ding.

JACOWSKI:
Dong.

REED:
Ding.

JACOWSKI:
Dong.

[ They keep going as the LIGHTS FADE OUT. ]



OLD-TIME FIGHTING



[ LIGHTS UP ON CURTIS AND JOEL WEARING ROBES, SITTING IN CHAIRS FACING EACH OTHER. ]

CURTIS:
Hey.

JOEL:
Hey.

CURTIS:
You know what I think is fun?

JOEL:
Waterslides.

CURTIS
You know what else I think is fun?

JOEL:
What?

CURTIS:
Civil War re-enactment.

JOEL:
Let's do that now.

[ They shed their robes, revealing long underwear. They get up and assume old-time fisticuffs postures as SAD, KEN BURNS-Y CIVIL WAR MUSIC PLAYS.

They dance in a fighting circle -- three jumps this way, three jumps that way. ]

CURTIS:
I'm about ready to clean your clock, you dirtbag!

JOEL:
Just try it and I'll knock your block off!

[ They dance toward each other -- two quick jumps. They sort of muddle their fists and grumble at each other.

Curtis throws a slow punch at Joel, which he easily avoids. ]

JOEL:
Ha! You'll have to do better than that, you crumb!

CURTIS:
I intend to!

[ Curtis throws another slow punch, which Joel again dodges. They dance away, in a circle, back together again. ]

JOEL:
Now it's my turn, dum-dum!

[ Joel throws a slow punch which Curtis easily avoids. ]

CURTIS:
Where'd you learn to fight, ragamuffin?

JOEL:
I learned to fight from your mother, whom I bedded ... biblically.

[ Curtis gasps in horror. Joel throws another slow punch, which Curtis avoids. ]

CURTIS:
I'll make you pay for that one, you know-nothing noodlehead!

JOEL:
I paid not a cent for the privilege of bedding your mother ... biblically!

[ Curtis gasps in horror. They dance away, in a circle, back together again. ]

CURTIS:
You'll pay for your insults, you dupe.

[ Curtis dings Joel on the chin. Joel stumbles and lowers his head. Curtis turns to the audience. ]

The North has won! Prohibition is over!

JOEL:
Slaves can drink as much as they want.

CURTIS:
Also the Stamp Act has been repealed.

JOEL:
Slaves can use stamps.

CURTIS:
The key to the north's victory: Alexander Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin.

JOEL:
And clean long johns, which prevented crotch rot.

CURTIS:
Robert E. Lee died of crotch rot.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. Salty is onstage. There is a small stack of luggage. He is pulling a rolling bag behind him. He puts it on the stack. He sits on the stack of luggage. Sighs. Pulls out a lollipop, unwraps it, puts the wrapper in his pocket, puts the lollipop in his mouth. He stands a little, unzips the bag, looks in. Snorts. Zips the bag back up. He pulls the wrapper back out, looks at it.

MUSIC FADES DOWN. ]

SALTY
This wrapper ... why not put a nice riddle on it? Something funny, something to laugh at. Maybe a little comic strip, with a nice little twist in the last panel. Get people smiling.

[ Beat. ]

If it turns to gum, let’s have some fun with it.

[ Mackey ENTERS with a clipboard. ]

MACKEY
Salty!

SALTY
Yeah, Mack?

MACKEY
You stack the bags for 1022 to Wichita?

SALTY
Stacked.

MACKEY
Sorry. We got word.

[ Mackey rips off the top sheet of the clipboard, hands it to Salty. ]

It’ll need a re-stack.

SALTY
Aw, Mack, come on!

MACKEY
Sorry, old man.

SALTY
How many times do we gotta stack the same group of bags?

MACKEY
That’s the job, old-timer. Just like you taught me.

[ Salty begins unstacking the bags. ] 
At least you’ll have an extra pair of hands.

SALTY
I told you, I don’t want no lousy Frankenstein hands! All’s I want is two! I’m just an old man, you hear!

MACKEY
The extra pair of hands come connected to the new baggie.

SALTY
We got a new baggie? Why?

MACKEY
Beats me. Maybe management thinks you aren’t gonna make it another week.

SALTY
They got another thing coming. I woke up this morning with an angel dancin’ on my toenails.

MACKEY
Great expression.

SALTY
I’m really enjoying my Great Expressions Day Calendar.

MACKEY
Glad to hear it.

SALTY
You’re one hell of a secret Santa, Mack.

MACKEY
Ditto, Salty.

SALTY
Still enjoying them sweet wafers I gave you?

MACKEY
Still eating them. Every day.

SALTY
Another pair of hands is gonna ruin secret Santa.

MACKEY
We’ll survive. Hold on, the kid’s finishing the paperwork.

[ Mackey EXITS. Salty sighs, keeps sucking his lollipop, begins stacking the bags in a different arrangement. ]

SALTY
Come on, you son of a bitch, I want that gum.

[ Mackey ENTERS with the Kid. ]

Who’s this?

MACKEY
This is the kid.

SALTY
This ain’t no kid. This is a girl!

MACKEY
That’s right.

KID
What’s the matter, you old turd? You never worked with a woman before?

SALTY
There ain’t no such thing as a kid who’s a girl. How about I call you The Kid Who’s a Girl?

KID
How about I tell you to fuck off?
 [ They assume physically confrontational postures, but Mackey intervenes. ]

MACKEY
Language! On this tarmac, we speak like civilized people!

KID [ to Salty ]
Anytime, old man, anytime.

SALTY
I dislike you immediately, you hear me!

[ She steps away, begins rolling a bag. ]

MACKEY
Take it easy. Her file says she’s an orphan.

SALTY
Since when do you see the files?

MACKEY
Recently.

SALTY
You’ve been talking like management lately, Mack.

MACKEY
Mr. Jeffries values my input is all. He wants to solicit my input for all hiring decisions.

SALTY
Does he? Does he solicit your input for you sticking your tongue all the way up his middle-management ass?

MACKEY
No, he doesn’t, Salty, because why would he? In the first place: gross.

SALTY
You’ve changed, Mackey.

MACKEY
The world has changed, Salty. I’m the same.

SALTY
Maybe you just seem different on account of the world changing around you.

MACKEY
But you’re the same, Salty.

SALTY
Maybe I changed in ways complementary to the ways in which the world was changing.

KID
So this is the job? I sit and watch you two jerky sticks take a huddle all day?

[ The Kid pulls a cigarette from her pocket. ]

Anyone have a lighter for this cigarette I wanna smoke?

MACKEY
No smoking, kid. Any one of these bags could be flammable.

KID
Aw, look at me, it’s like I thought this was a job for adults and not my god damn home room or something. Do I need mommy to sign a note for my cigarette, Mr. Teacher, pretty please?

MACKEY
Those things will rot your lungs, kid.

SALTY
I ain’t got no light. I quit.

[ The Kid, frustrated, squeezes the cigarette in her hand. Then she tears it in two. Rather than throwing the ends away, she pulls out a ziploc bag, puts one end in the ziploc bag, and carefully seals it. She puts the bag in her pocket. ]

KID
For lunch.

[ She puts the butt-end behind her ear. ]

For luck.

[ She returns to work. ]

SALTY
Your luck ain’t much if it got you here, kid.

MACKEY
Come on.

SALTY
Excuse me?

MACKEY
This job offers some really okay opportunities.

SALTY
You hear that kid? Play your cards right. When they promote this bright-eyed baggie here to President of the airline, you could get a cushy gig blendin’ up his presidential smoothies.

KID
Doesn’t sound like my speed.

MACKEY
Laugh if you want to. I have no delusions. But if this is my career, well, I’m going to treat it like a career and--

SALTY
How you think they’ll give you a corner office when you never even went to college?

MACKEY
There are classes. There are classes in the evening and I take them. I’m learning about numbers. I can do the math. I learned where humans come from, and how a battery works.

KID
I went to college.

[ Pause. ]

Just a year or two. Then, things changed.

MACKEY
Do you want to tell us about the things that changed?

KID
Maybe when we’ve come to know each other slightly better.

MACKEY
Fair enough.

KID
Which might be soon. Who knows? It’s possible that only a short time into the future, perhaps even during this same day, the day that I met you for the first time, we will begin to know each other very well indeed.

SALTY
A mutual understanding might form!

KID
Right, a sense of common experiences and struggles.

SALTY
Which helps us to bridge our differences.

[ They move toward each other, stare at each other in mutual admiration. Suddenly, Salty punches her. ]

There’s your light, you goddam punk!

[ The Kid is ready to strike back. Mackey intervenes. ]

“Fuck you, you old turd”?! Fuck me?!

MACKEY
Civility, you two! For God’s sake, we have to set an example for everyone here, even those who don’t work at the airport!

KID
What’s the matter, old man? I touch a nerve?

SALTY
I’ll give you a light! I’ll give you a lights-out!

KID [ to Mackey ]
He’s crazy. Maybe it’s dementia.

MACKEY
Maybe you should watch your mouth, kid.

KID
I can’t watch my mouth. My eyes are in my head.

MACKEY
Cool off, Salty. Listen to the Eurhythmics for a few.

SALTY
All right, all right.

[ Salty breaks off, pulls out an iPod, puts earbuds in, closes his eyes and bobs his head. ]

MACKEY
Now you listen to me, kid.

KID
I’m listening.

MACKEY
Don’t give me that shit. Listen good.

[ Kid bends her ear to Mackey with her forefinger. ]

Better.

[ She bends it more. ]

Right there. I don’t give a damn if you’re a woman or a girl or you went to college or whatever you are. Down here, we’re all equal. Everyone’s vest has got the same shine. And that man is the finest baggage handler I ever met, all right? He taught me. He’ll teach you too, if you shut your mouth and listen.

[ Kid is silent. ]

Salty!

[ Salty takes out his earbuds. ]

The kid’s ready to shut her mouth and learn a few things.

SALTY
I’ll believe it when I see it.

[ The kid shrugs. ]

Let’s see what you’ve got, kid who’s a girl.

[ Pause. Kid picks up a single bag, puts it down shrugs. Salty shakes his head. Kid picks up the bag again, shakes it, puts it down. ]

Stack them.

KID
They’re stacked.

MACKEY
Stack them again, kid.

[ Kid begins to rearrange the stack. ]

SALTY
No! Listen to the bags. They’re whispering. They’re whispering shapes into your ear. The shapes of stacks. “We’re gonna be loaded into a ....” I don’t know, some type of plane. They’ll let you know. It’s big. International flight, maybe. Listen.

[ Kid moves one bag, the stack falls apart, kid throws the bag on top of the ruined stack. ]

Yeah, that’s fine.

MACKEY
Good work, kid. But stacks are only part of the job. We live by a code here.

SALTY
A code born when the first bag was stacked on the second bag.

KID
Sounds dumb.

MACKEY
You’re about to find out that it isn’t.

[ Kid gasps. ]

SALTY
One, never leave a bag unbagged.

KID
What’s that mean?

MACKEY
Listen. Two, you always help a fellow baggie.

KID
Fine.

SALTY
Three, never ... shit in the bags.

KID
That’s in the top three things to remember?

SALTY
Kid, you spend a lot of time alone with a lot of bags. Eight hour shifts, no one to relieve you. A pot of coffee in your gut, churning around. You’ve been snacking on heads of iceberg lettuce like they was apples. You have no idea.

KID
I don’t eat fruit. Fruits for bats.

SALTY
You watch your mouth!

MACKEY
Kid, this is one code that we live by. There are others you will learn as well.

SALTY
“Learn all the codes” is part of the second code, which you aren’t ready for.

MACKEY
We’ll teach you tomorrow.

SALTY
Then there are the lessons, which are also very important.

KID
Look, if I wanted to hear a bunch of lectures by guys in weird clothes and dumb hats, I’d have stayed in college. I want to get my hands dirty. These bags won’t bag themselves.

MACKEY
That’s the lesson! Bags don’t bag themselves.

SALTY
I made a mistake when I made that plural. There is one lesson.

KID
All right, I know your damn dumb code now, can I get to work?

SALTY
It’s a lesson. Keep your lesson clear from your codes, kid, else next thing you know you’ll be shitting in a bag.

MACKEY
This is pretty complicated. We should write it down sometime.

SALTY
Who has the time to write when you’re on your feet all day sweating over bags?

[ SOUND: BREAK WHISTLE. ]

SALTY
Break time.

MACKEY
Time for a break, then.

[ They all sit down. ]

I wish I had thought to bring a snack or something.

SALTY
Or a crossword.

MACKEY
Every day, it slips my mind.

KID
Don’t look at me.

[ Salty pulls out a flask, takes a sip, hands it to the Kid. ]

SALTY
You did all right with the bags, kid. Sorry I punched you in the face.

KID
Sorry I called you an old turd.

[ She takes the flask. She pulls out a bendy straw and puts it in the flask. ]

MACKEY
How do you put a straw in that man’s flask? He’s making amends, damn it!

SALTY
It’s all right.

KID
This tastes like my mom’s mouthwash.

SALTY
It is mouthwash, kid. Fresh breath, fresh insides, fresh mind.

[ She hands the flask back to Salty. ]

KID
How long’s our break?

SALTY
45 minute break. Then two-hour lunch. Optional work past three.

[ The Kid pulls out a comic book. ]

MACKEY
Cigarettes will rot your lungs and those funny papers will rot your brain, kid.

KID
Bull. This is classic stuff. Elemental struggles, like Greek mythology.

SALTY
Greek myth-what-ogy?

MACKEY
That’s college talk, Salty. What did you study, kid?

KID
Math. Calculus-physics, mostly.

MACKEY
Wouldn’t have figured you for a number-herder.

KID
Math’s solid. Hard facts. Two plus two always equals four.

SALTY
This ain’t college, kid. Sometimes, two plus two equals a broken back!

KID
Ever get your diploma, old man?

SALTY
Didn’t go to school much. I went on Fridays, 10-12 for early two-hour lunch. I liked PE. Do stuff with your hands; run with your legs. No thinking. No pop quizzes.

MACKEY
I’d have gone to college, only my folks wouldn’t stand for it. Eighteen years old, and straight into the family biz. My pop handled baggage, his pop handled baggage.

KID
It’s all baloney, anyway.

MACKEY
There’s things I would have done if I had the chance. I’d have liked to see the world. Sometimes I think about bagging myself. Find a bag bound for India and tuck myself inside. Learn about their culture’s deep spirituality.

SALTY
You see here, kid? This is what happens to a baggie with big dreams. Dreams about bagging himself. Then he ends up like Henry.

KID
Henry?

MACKEY
Henry tried to send himself to Japan. Got off during a connection in Atlanta and stayed there for two years. He wasn’t too bright. In fact, he was maybe retarded or something.

SALTY [ sighs ]
They say you can kiss the sky from the roof of a skyscraper in Atlanta.

KID
That’s a myth.

SALTY
That’s a what?

KID
Never mind.

[ Beat. ]

SALTY
I ain’t bagging myself. But sometimes, I wonder if they’ll let old Salty transfer to that Anchorage gig. It’s a solo job.

KID
Why would you want to go there? It’s nothing but blubber and igloos.

MACKEY
They only get three bags a day in Anchorage, kid.

SALTY
We should call it the Juneaux job, because it’s in Juneaux.

[ Phone rings. Mackey pulls a cell phone from his pocket. ]

Oh, Mr. Vice President of Everything is so important he has to be available via portable telephone at any time.

MACKEY
It’s not a phone. It’s a reminding machine. It’s reminding me I have a phone call.

[ Mackey answers his phone. ]

Mackey here. Yes, sir.

[ Mackey walks away from Kid and Salty. ]

KID [ to Salty ]
I have a cell phone.

SALTY
I do, too. It comes in handy quite often.

KID
I agree with that.

[ Salty and Kid share a look. ]

Is this the beginning of us bridging the gap between our very different yet equally strong personalities?

SALTY
Maybe. But it will be more apparent later.

MACKEY [ on the phone. ]
You can count on us, sir.

[ Mackey hangs up, puts the phone away. ]

Kid! Salty! The 3112 is coming in earlier then expected. It’s gonna be an unload and go and load and go.

SALTY
No big deal, Mackey. We’ve done hundreds of ‘em.

MACKEY
This one is a big deal. The biggest deal. Most of the passengers are directly related to the airport’s Ground Operations Management Auditor.

KID
Big whoop.

MACKEY
You’re right, kid. It is a “big whoop.”

[ Mackey uses finger quotes. ]

If things go well, we may all have brighter futures.

SALTY
But especially you, huh, Mack?

MACKEY
Maybe if you quit hasslin’ the higher ups and laid off the “I don’t care about anyone but Salty” routine, you would be calling the shots, instead of the guy that you trained and groomed. The guy who thought of you as a mentor. The guy who looked up to you until one day you--

SALTY
What, Mackey?

MACKEY
You died inside, Salty. Now you’re like an unpacked bag. Empty and going nowhere.

KID
Who was the guy who thought you were a minotaur?

MACKEY
It was me.

SALTY
Maybe I don’t want what you got, Mackey. Maybe I don’t want to be up in some office, pissing on all the little folks on the tarmac.

MACKEY
You’re talking like an agitator, Salty. Know what happens to agitators, kid?

KID
What?

MACKEY
They end up in the big bag.

SALTY
Sellout!

MACKEY
I ain’t no sellout! I’ve got a wife to support!

SALTY
Do you? Do you, Mackey?

MACKEY
I do.

SALTY
Well, good for you.

KID
Yeah, congratulations.

MACKEY
She’s cheating on me, all right?

[ They gasp. ]

For three months. I know. With my brother. We used to be so in love. Not my brother, my wife.

KID
Used to, Mackey?

MACKEY
We couldn’t keep our hands off each other when we first met. Like two monkeys in a pitch black room trying to find each other’s genitals. It’s funny. I remember when I first met her. I was workin’ bags, she was behind the counter. U.S. Airways. Our eyes met when she was handing me a yellow duffel. Later that day, we were sneaking off to do the nasty.

KID
What’s the nasty like?

SALTY
You never did the nasty? I’m confused. In college movies, everyone has sex.

MACKEY
We’re talking about the nasty.

SALTY
My mistake.

MACKEY
Kid, let’s just say they call it the nasty for a reason.

[ The kid claps her hands eagerly. ]

I don’t know. I don’t know. I guess I figure if I can just land that promotion, start bringing home the big paycheck...

KID
Don’t bother. When it’s broken, you can’t fix it.

[ Pause. ]

SALTY
You gonna say something else?

KID
In a minute. Get ready to gasp.

SALTY
I was born ready.

[ Pause. ]

KID
Naw, screw it.

[ She gets up to leave. ]

MACKEY
Where you goin’, kid?

SALTY
Break’s not over yet!

KID
Look, I didn’t start this job to friendly up with some old fairies who talk about their feelings like sorority sob sisters!

SALTY
I like to share feelings.

KID
I’ve had it rough! I went to college and it sucked! I had a nervous breakdown, OK?

[ They gasp. ]

Let me back up. I wasn’t born an orphan. My old man left when I was just a kid. It was just me and my mom, and her bottle of pills.

[ They gasp again. ]

You know what she kept in that bottle of pills? Buttons. She kept buttons in there! If you lost a button, she’d replace it with another button. Also, she kept pills in there! Which she abused! She was a prostitute! A big prostitute! And she’d sew buttons on anything!

SALTY
I feel like gasping, but my disposition as a pessimist leads me to believe you.

[ The kid pulls out a bottle of pills. They stare at her. ]

KID
What? These are brain pills. They’re unrelated to my mother’s abuse of pills that eventually killed her.

SALTY
I take pills too, kid. For my heart.

KID
Is this the moment, Salty?

SALTY
Soon. Let’s trade pills.

MACKEY
Wait, wait ... I’m no doctor, but that seems like a good idea.

[ They trade pills. ]

SALTY
What are these brain pills for?

KID
For my nervous breakdown. And my memory. I don’t remember anything from my childhood except for the things I already told you. What are yours for?

SALTY
For my heart attack. They keep my blood from crusting into play-doh, like from that factory for kids, remember, you turn the thing and it comes out like a meat grinder.

MACKEY
What are you talking about, Salty?

SALTY
That’s what my blood could turn into. I’m remembering things!

[ Beat. ]

I remember that I never had any kids.

KID
You never had no kids, Salty? Not even by accident?

SALTY
Until one day I did. He turned sixteen, told me he hated me, left the house, packed his bags.

MACKEY
In that order?

SALTY
Yeah. The order of events is now confusing to me.

KID
That’s some story.

SALTY
I found out where he’s living now. Sometimes I drive by my son’s house, at night, you know, just to see him. Sometimes he’s banging a broad. I do the respectful thing, you know -- don’t touch myself. Then I drop a couple of bills in his mailbox. A pair of dollar bills, then my electric bill, which is outrageous!

MACKEY
Those electric fatcats. They live in a world paved with lightning. Pockets lined with money.

SALTY
I raised him alone, all alone, you hear me??!!

MACKEY
We hear you, Salty.

SALTY
OK, then I’ll quit shouting now!

KID
Don’t not shout on account of me. I’m used to old men shouting at me. My old man shouted at me.

MACKEY
Geez, kid. I’m sorry to hear that.

KID
He shouted at me like I was some kind of target for a shouting machine.

SALTY
As a father who shouted at his child I know how terrible it can be.

KID
Is this the moment, Salty?

SALTY
Bingo.

MACKEY
I shouted at my wife before.

SALTY
It happens, Mack.

MACKEY
I worked at a dry cleaner for 12 years. I never told anyone.

[ They shrug. ]

It’s actually not a good story.

[ They gasp. ]

SALTY
Well, is there anything else? We got 42 minutes left on this break.

KID
I got nothing.

MACKEY
I got nothing.

[ Beat. ]

SALTY [ shouts suddenly ]
I’m sorry I broke your wife’s Simon game, all right?

MACKEY
That’s fine.

SALTY
It was a fun game, and I enjoyed playing it, and I’m sorry I broke it.

MACKEY
Eh. If you own it, it gets boring fast.

SALTY
Also, my father left me too.

KID
I figured. The cycle of hurt, and so forth.

SALTY
It’s crazy because later my son also left me.

KID
I know.

SALTY
I had a kid once.

MACKEY
We know.

SALTY
I’m Salty!

[ They nod. ]

MACKEY
Kid.

KID
Yeah?

MACKEY
You’re one of us now.

KID That was fast.

SALTY
It was. It usually takes till lunch.

MACKEY
But you still gotta be straight with us.

KID
I ain’t no lesbian! I told you, those are brain pills.

MACKEY
Wouldn’t matter if you were, kid. Salty’s gay.

SALTY
What?!

MACKEY
Give him another brain pill.

[ She does. Beat. ]

SALTY
I’m a salty gay!

MACKEY
We want to know what the hell leads a college girl down here to the tarmac. Tell it to us straight, kid.

KID Look. I’ve had enough talk. I just want to get my hands on those bags.

SALTY
Come on, kid.

KID
Stuff it, dino-turd! Our fast friendship is now crumbling faster than it began!

MACKEY
“Always help a fellow baggie,” kid.

SALTY
We are brothers on the tarmac, even brothers who are girls.

MACKEY
Look, kid. We’ve all got our own longstanding emotional problems that we carry with us. We’ve all got our own ...

SALTY
Uh...

MACKEY
Our own, you know...

SALTY
Our own things that we carry for our whole lives.

MACKEY
Yeah, like our own ... longstanding emotional problems that we carry with us.

KID
Leave me alone! This is the kind of emotional honesty that precipitates nervous breakdowns!

MACKEY
People change kid. People get older, and they get new bags. Same shit, different bags.

KID
Fuck you!

SALTY
Same shit, different bags! Never shit in the bags!

KID
You wanna know why I’m here? You wanna know?! I’m looking for my old man, that’s why! That’s right, my no-account, no-good, flop-flippin, two-timin, jelly-beanin old man!

MACKEY
What makes you think you’re gonna find him here, kid?

KID
Cause that’s all I got, okay? My ma burned all the pictures of him after he left. I can’t really remember what he looks like. What I do remember is his suitcase.

SALTY [throwing his hands up in the air]
Psh! Another “I don’t remember what my dad looks like so I’m looking for his luggage” case!

MACKEY
We’ve never had one of those.

SALTY
Whatever!

KID [ stepping downstage ]
I still remember like it was yesterday. He had his suitcase sitting on the front porch, one of those rolly types. He an my ma we’re fightin. I was sittin on the porch with the bag. He came out and touseled my hair and said “take care, Kid” and then he started to leave. That whirring sound. Then “cachunk, cachunk, cachunk, cachunk, cachunk, cachunk, cachunk”......our front porch had a lot of steps.

SALTY
Another “My front porch had a buncha steps” case!

MACKEY
Salty, please, let the kid finish her aside.

KID
The sound of him rolling away was like the sound of a kid on his Big Wheel. A really sad, slow kid riding down the street on his Big Wheel. Sometimes I can still hear the noise of those wheels hitting each step. Sometimes at night, when I’m in bed, smoking a nice cigarette and the subways are all quiet and the cars are all resting, when it’s real still out, I can hear it: “cachunk, cachunk, cachunk, cachunk”.

MACKEY
Well, what color was this rolly bag?

KID
Grey.

MACKEY
That’s a pretty common color kid. Was it hard or soft?

KID
Hard.

MACKEY
That’s pretty common, too. Brand?

KID
Samsonite.

MACKEY
Were there any unique, identifying features to this suitcase at all?

KID
Yeah! It’s my pa’s suitcase! Is that unique and identifying enough for ya? [ pause ] I do remember one more thing. There was a sticker on the side. It said “Whaddup, dog?” and had a drawing of a Bull Terrier on it.

MACKEY
Well.......maybe you’ll get lucky.

SALTY
Ohhhhh, another “maybe you’ll get lu-”

MACKEY
Salty, please!

KID
It’s okay. I’m done.

SALTY
Hey, kid, what did you say that sticker said?

KID
What sticker, you old fart?

SALTY
The sticker on your old man’s suitcase, you ingrate!

KID
It said “Whaddup, Dawg” and had a picture of one of them Spuds Mackenzie-type dogs on it.

SALTY
I think we may have a match.

[ KID runs over to SALTY and MACKEY stops what he’s doing to observe as well. They stare for a while at the suitcase. ]

SALTY
Well, Kid, what you waiting for. That bag ain’t gonna open itself! That’s in the second code!

KID
You really think I oughta?

SALTY
You’ve been lookin’ for this guy ever since he left, right? You’ve been lookin’ for a way to track him down since you don’t know what he looks like. Here’s your chance.

KID
What if he’s a total wad? What if he’s a jerk face no one? What if I don’t like him?

SALTY
There’s only one way to find out.

[ Kid tentatively begins to open the bag.  
LIGHTS DIM.

There is a light coming from the bag that illuminates their faces as they stare in wonder. ]

KID
What.....kind....of........idiot packs a lit flashlight?

[ She snaps the suitcase closed.

LIGHTS BACK TO NORMAL LEVEL.

She passes the bag down the line. ]

MACKEY
Doncha wanna know what he’s like, kid?

KID
No. He’s a waster. He was always a waster. Wastes people’s lives. Wastes batteries.

[ She does. ]

Also, I just realized I got my real family right here.

SALTY
And before our first lunch, even.

MACKEY
What if that’s him over there?

SALTY
Hey! Kid’s dad!

KID
He looked! He looked! He’s waving! He’s coming this way. I’m gonna run and meet him on that empty runway.

SALTY
No, kid. Don’t run out on the runway. It’s part of the second code. Kind of a footnote.

[ The kid ignores Salty and runs offstage.

SOUND: PLANE LANDING (LOUD!). ]

MACKEY
The 3112! It’s coming in even earlier than when it was early earlier.

SALTY
The kid! She’s gonna get smooshed! Kid!

[ As Salty yells after the kid his gum falls out of his mouth. ]

My gum!

MACKEY
My career!

KID [ offstage ]
My lifelong search for closure!

[ Pause. Mackey shakes his head. ]

MACKEY
This fucking job.

SALTY
Fucking kid. I’ll never forget you, kid.

[ Salty takes a brain pill. Kid continues screaming. ]

MACKEY
Listen to her go. Should we call an ambulance?

SALTY
No, Mack. We’re baggies. This is how she would have wanted it. Dyin’ real slow under the landing gear of a passenger liner, babblin’ crazy talk because the pain has broken her mind.

MACKEY
You’re probably right.

SALTY
I got her brain pills now, so, you know, not a total loss.

[ He swallows a mouthful. ]

MACKEY
This fucking job.

SALTY
I know, Mack. I know.

[ Pause. The kid finally lets out a death gurgle as they resume stacking. The kid’s hat rolls onstage. Mackey reaches down, picks it up. He pauses for a moment. Salty takes the hat, puts it on. ]

SALTY
Look, I’m the kid! I’m a girl and I’m looking for my dad! I got crushed by a plane.

[ Mackey snatches the hat. ]

MACKEY
Not yet, Salty. Not yet.

SALTY
I guess you’re right.

[ Mackey unzips one of the bags, puts the hat in, zips it up. ]

MACKEY
Hope you make it to Atlanta, kid. Kiss the sky once for me.

SALTY
For us, Mack. For us.

[ They join hands. ]

Come on, Mack, let’s stack a few.

MACKEY
All right.

SALTY
Or ... maybe just call it a day?

MACKEY
Now you’re talking.

[ They exit as the LIGHTS FADE TO BLACK. ]

[ LIGHTS UP and MUSIC for bows. ]

[ MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Curtis, Courtney, and Joel do a quick intro. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change with MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Curtis is seated onstage, reading a newspaper. ]

[ Joel and Courtney are offstage, or onstage with their backs to the audience. They are speaking about something. Curtis gets excited. ]

[ Joel and Courtney turn around to reveal that they are eating yogurt. ]

[ SOUND CUE. ]

V/O
You thought they were talking about something else. But they were talking about yogurt. “But It’s Yogurt”, by Dannon.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change with MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ An operator, Mandy, sitting at a chair. ]

Mandy:
9111, What's your non-emergency?

Caller:
This pizza guy just ripped me off. I asked for a large and I got a medium.

Mandy:
Okay, is the pizza in the house with you?

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
Is it still warm?

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
Okay, good, good. Is the pizza guy still in the house?

Caller:
No, he ran out the door and someone shot him.

Mandy:
Did you see who shot him?

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
Was it you?

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
Okay, sir, I'm gonna just ask you to stay calm and I'll dispatch a non-emergency officer to your location with some extra pizza immediately. Can you stay calm for me?

Caller:
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

Mandy:
Okay, sir, just apply some pizza to your mouth and hang on until we can get there. Hi, I'm Mandy and I'm a dispatcher for 9111, the non-emergency emergency telephone number. In recent years, 911 dispatchers have been getting more and more calls for...Oh, getting a call. 9111, what's your non-emergency?

Caller:
Yeah, there’s mustard on this hamburger.

Mandy:
Alright sir, stay calm for me.

Caller:
Okay.

Mandy:
Sir, where did you get the hamburger?

Caller:

Mandy:
Okay, sir. I’m going to dispatch one of our non-emergency officers to your location. Sir, can you stay calm till then?

Caller:
Yes, ma’am.

Mandy:
Thank you, sir. I love my job. I’ve always wanted to help people but now I’m doing this instead and that’s okay, too. 9111, what’s your non-emergency?

Caller:

Mandy:
Why are you sad, sir?

Caller:
I don’t know.

Mandy:
Okay, sir, are feeling suicidal or like hurting other people?

Caller:
No! Not at all!

Mandy:
Alright, sir, just stay right where you are and we’ll dispatch some non-emergency officers to your location to hug you.

Caller:
Okay! Yay! Hugs!

Mandy:

Caller:

Mandy:
Sir, sir, can I ask you to calm down? Now, where has your brother gone?

Caller:
To the Stop ‘n Shop ‘n Pay ‘n Save. He said he was gon go down there and find Marla and beat her like a redheaded step child.

Mandy:
Alright, Sir, I'll dispatch an non-emergency officer to your location with a pair of crutches for you to use while you confront your brother. Just stay where you are and stay calm. Can you do that for me?

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
I find my job extremely rewarding. I love being able to help people. I get to have contact with so many different kinds of people from the mildly crazy to the truly insane. 9111 what's your non-emergency?

Caller:
Yeah, these pajamas I bought say they're fire resistant but they're not resisting fire.

Mandy:
Okay, sir. Are they on fire right now?

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
Are you wearing them, sir?

(pause)

Caller:
Yes.

Mandy:
Okay, sir, I'm going to transfer you to one of our information collection specialists. They'll take the pertinent information like where you bought the pajamas and the brand and we'll get this mess sorted out for you, okay? Stay on the line, sir.

Caller:
Okay.

Mandy:
Thank you, sir. Here at 9111....oh, getting another call. Busy day today! 9111, what is your non-emergency?

Caller:
There's a man in my house and he's got a knife.

Mandy:
Sir? Are you calling 9111 with an actual emergency?

Caller:
Please, please help me. He's got my little girl.

Mandy:
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to hang up and call 911 if you have an emergency.

Caller:
Please, oh god, oh god....

(line goes dead)

Mandy:
Idiot. The government has also set up 91111, a number for incoherent mumblings, piercing screams, random number pushing and heavy breathing.

(James enters)

James:
Hey, Mandy!

Mandy:
Hi James! Time for a Mars bar!

(Mandy exits)

James:
Hi, I'm James, dispatcher for 91111. I am specially trained to decipher the bizarre sounds that people can make over the phone....oh, getting a call. 91111, what's you're indecipherable message?

James:
Maam, I'm going to have to ask you to call 911 if this is a real emergency.

Caller:

James:

Caller:
(gurggles, line goes dead)

James:
Idiot.

[ Something catches her eye and her expression darkens. ]

COURTNEY’S THOUGHTS (V/O)
Jesus. Jesus. There he is. I thought no way he’d be here. I thought no way he knows these people. But there he is. There he is.

MALE VOICE (OFFSTAGE)
You wouldn’t believe my lift time yesterday. It’s a whole new world.

C THOUGHTS
That guy who won’t stop talking about handstands. What does he think? He thinks people want to hear about handstands? He thinks that adults go to parties to talk about handstands?

MALE VOICE
It’s not hard on the hands, once you start doing it right. The first few times, I definitely tweaked my wrist. I’ll admit it.

[ Laughs. ]

C THOUGHTS
It makes him happy. I’m sure there is something to doing handstands. Maybe doing handstands is worthwhile. I’m not denying that. Why would I deny that? I exercise. I do stretches. I don’t dispute the value of stretching. I’d be excited to do a handstand. I did handstands as a girl. Didn’t I? Probably. That’s the kind of thing I would do. I think every child at least tries to do a handstand, unless they’re timid. I mean, I don’t remember everything. But … but …!

MALE VOICE
If you want to hold it, you have to be really aware of your body.

C THOUGHTS
People know that it’s creepy. It’s not just me. Look at those people. Poor people. Look at them stuck there listening to this. What the hell are they supposed to do with this, all this information about handstands from this guy’s perspective? Why does he want them to have this information?

MALE VOICE
Straddle position, that’s another area I’m trying to explore.

C THOUGHTS
Maybe he’s waiting for someone to ask him to do a handstand. That could be it. I’ve never seen anyone talk so much about doing handstands without doing a handstand. It’s ridiculous. 
MALE VOICE
A little bit of powder helps.

C THOUGHTS
All talk, no handstand. Phony. This is it. I’m going to shut this guy up forever. Forever and ever.

MALE VOICE
There’s a great community to it, too. Hand-balancers are some of the best people I’ve ever known.

C THOUGHTS
It’s time to take action. It’s time to help those poor people. It’s time to take a stand for the truth.

[ She pulls a chair over, makes an attempt to do a handstand, using the chair to support her. ]

This is it, Courtney. This is it. You win, Courtney. You win forever.

It’s a coke can angel.

MAN:
OK. Show it to me.

WOMAN:
I collect coke cans, crush them, paint them, and turn them into little angels.

MAN:
I see.

WOMAN:
Each angel has a unique hand-painted face.

MAN:
And what are the noses made of?

WOMAN:
They’re just little balls.

MAN:
Little balls, huh?

WOMAN:
Painted balls. I buy them in packs of fifty at Hobby Lobby.

MAN:
And you attach them how?

WOMAN:
Hot glue.

MAN:
And the eyes?

WOMAN: These are googly eyes.

MAN:
I see that.

MAN:
Let’s take a call. We have Charles calling from Glenford.  Charles, You’re on Show Me Your Craft.

CALLER:
Did you say you make those angels out of coke cans?

WOMAN:
Yes.

CALLER:
Only Coca Cola cans?

WOMAN:
Not necessarily.

CALLER:
But you would use Coca Cola cans?

WOMAN:
Yes.

CALLER:
I’m coming to see that. You’re gonna show it to me.

MAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, he said

[ The audience yells along with host ]

Show it to me.

MAN:
When making these angels, is any soda can superior to the others?

WOMAN:
No. You can use any brand of soda can.

CALLER:
Have you used a Coca Cola can for an angel before?

WOMAN:
Oh yes.

MAN:
Great.

WOMAN: Yeah.

MAN:
Thanks, caller.

CALLER:
So, do I just hang up now?

MAN:
Do you have any more questions or comments?

Nope.

CALLER:
Sometimes I go by Chuck, and I like those angels you make.

WOMAN:
Thanks.

MAN:
We have a call from C. Davies in Yoketon. You’re on Show Me Your Craft.

Me again.

MAN:
Chuck?

WOMAN:
Charles?

CALLER:
My last name is Davies. Charles Davies. Do you prefer to use a specific brand of can?

WOMAN:
No. Not really.

CALLER:
One can doesn’t take a certain paint better than the others?

WOMAN:
Not really.

MAN:
Great.

CALLER:
What about hot glue? Do certain things hold better to certain cans when hot glue is used?

WOMAN:
Nope.

Hey guys.

Oh yeah.

CALLER:
I didn’t hang up.

MAN:
Chuck?

WOMAN:

Surge, Chuck.

MAN:
No.

WOMAN:
No.

MAN:
Chuck, Surge?

CHUCK:
It was around in the late nineties. It came in a green can and was rumored to lower your sperm count.

WOMAN:
Was that your question, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

MAN:
Thanks, Chuck.

[ Chuck enters. ]

CALLER:
I finally made it, y’all. This is so great.

MAN:
Margaret, you remember Chuck? From the phone calls.

WOMAN:
OK.

CALLER:
I got another question.

WOMAN:
Great.

CALLER:
If you happened upon a Surge can would you use it for one of your angels?

WOMAN:
Yes, I suppose I would.

CALLER:
What if I told you I had a Surge can? Would you use that specific one?

WOMAN:
Sure.

CALLER:
If I had a Surge can and gave it to you would you use it?

WOMAN:
Yes I would. I think that would be kind of fun.

MAN:
That would be fun. Chuck, give her that Surge can.

WOMAN:
I can make you a special Chuck angel.

MAN:
Do you have a Surge can, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

WOMAN:
Do you have it with you?

CALLER:
Yes. [ Pause ] No. Can I see that coke can angel?

WOMAN:
Oh yes.

[ She hands Chuck the Angel. ]

CALLER:
This isn’t really my kind of thing. When you guys were telling me bout it I got really excited. I had so many questions I couldn’t think straight. Now that I see it, no thank you.

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

LADY:
There is was. A fucking snapdragon in the dead of summer. A snapdragon. In summer. Hot, hot ass summer, too, one of the hottest I ever experienced. But there it was, this snapdragon.

Let me start from the beginning. I've been widowed, oh, 3 years I guess. James and I were just getting started, we bought a house in a nice neighborhood, we were planning a family. He goes up in the attic one day to run some speaker wire, suddenly the lights go out, I go up to check on him, he's gone. Electrocuted. Running fucking speaker wire. What a price for surround sound.

James and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago. I know, it's not the typical romantic getaway but we both hated the beach. That was actually a bonding point for us. Hated sand. Tar. Salt water. Hated the beach.

We got married in April so we got to see all the great spring flowers blooming in Chicago, things that would never bloom in Texas. Tulips, poppies, daffodils and snapdragons. Snapdragons everywhere. You know, you can take the bloom of a snapdragon and if you squeeze it just right on the sides, the bloom will open an close like a little mouth. Like a little dragon's mouth.

James loved the snapdragons. Oh, he talked about them. The first thing he said when we signed the papers on our house was "I'm gonna plant some Snapdragons." I was like "James, you know that's a region 2 plant. There's no way it's gonna grow here. No way." He just said he'd at least like to try it. That was the thing about James. He was determined.

Course, he never got around to planting those Snapdragons. He died in January, too early to plant. But six months later, six months later......there's a fucking snapdragon growing in the dead heat of summer.

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
You know, people ask us a lot of questions about our creative process.

JOEL
No, they don't.

COURTNEY [ to Joel ]
Joel, that's the premise.

CURTIS [ to audience ]
Developing a premise, by the way, is an important part of our creative process. In case you’re curious about our creative process.

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
Which, for the sake of this sketch, we are imagining that you are.

JOEL
I don't like this sketch.

CURTIS
You liked it during our reading, Joel.

JOEL
I was a different person then.

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
The reading, which Curtis has just mentioned, is another part of our creative process. It allows us to check the overall comic effectiveness, or "goodness", of a sketch. We'd like to give you a demonstration of what that's like.

[ Courtney sits with Curtis and Joel and picks up a copy of the script. ]

JOEL
Now?

COURTNEY
Yes.

[ Joel takes a deep breath. ]

JOEL
Hey guys, I wrote a new sketch. I think it's pretty good. Would you like to read it together?

CURTIS
Sure.

COURTNEY
Of course, Joel. After all, reading together is an important part of our creative process.

JOEL
OK. Courtney, you read for the bank teller.

COURTNEY
Sounds good.

JOEL
Curtis, you read for the organ grinder.

CURTIS
Does he have an accent?

JOEL
Just try to feel it out.

COURTNEY
Does the bank teller have an accent?

JOEL
Yes, but I want you to feel it out.

COURTNEY
OK. Give me a hint, though?

JOEL
Not Puerto Rican.

COURTNEY
OK.

JOEL
I'll read the stage directions.

[ They all look to their scripts. ]

JOEL
Act one, scene one.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Question?

COURTNEY
I just want to say, right now, this feels more like a full-length play than a sketch.

JOEL
OK, could we hold notes until the end?

COURTNEY
I didn't want to forget.

CURTIS
Just take the note, Joel.

JOEL
YOU TAKE THE NOTE! I'm sorry. I lost my temper. It won’t happen again. Can we start over?

CURTIS
Sure.

COURTNEY
It's just, when you start talking multiple acts and multiple scenes, it feels more like a play than a sketch.

JOEL
YOU FEEL MORE LIKE A PLAY THAN A SKETCH! I'm sorry. I promise that that won't happen again. I'll take the note. Let's start over, please.

[ beat ]

JOEL
Act one, scene one.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Already got that one.

[ Courtney lowers her hand. ]

JOEL
OK, act one, scene one. Lights up. A female bank teller, standing behind the counter of a bank. Her name tag says "Amber". Her hair is up in two curiously youthful pigtails. She is wearing a pale yellow sweater and a tan skirt, just past knee-length. Underneath, invisible to the audience for the entire duration of the sketch, is a red brassiere and mismatched blue-and-yellow stripe panties from Target.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Could we please hold notes till the end?

COURTNEY
I don't see how the underwear is relevant if the audience won't see it.

JOEL
I'm painting a word picture.

CURTIS
I get it. I think it's funny. I mean, here she is, ostensibly, like, a bank teller in a yellow sweater, but then, red bra. Right? It's funny, because, like, red bra?

COURTNEY
Look, I don't object to wearing a red bra. I own a red bra, so in that respect it's convenient for me.

JOEL
Is it the panties that trouble you?

COURTNEY
I just want to revisit this section later.

CURTIS
I'll make a note.

[ Curtis makes a note in pen on the script. ]

CURTIS
I'm circling that section, and I'm writing a "2V", as in visit twice or re-visit.

COURTNEY
OK, I'll start recording a key for our notes so we can remember what they mean.

[ She makes a note in pen on her script. ]

COURTNEY
"2V" equals re-visit.

JOEL
Should we start from the beginning or just pick it up where we were?

CURTIS
Let's keep going. I think we've got really good momentum.

JOEL [ reading ]
The teller is finishing off a half-eaten tofu pad thai in a styrofoam to-go container and daydreaming about the summers that she used to spend at her grandfather's lake house. She knows that it is against bank policy to eat at the counter, but it is a slow part of the afternoon and her manager is out running a personal errand. Every once in a while, she scratches a persistent itch on her upper right arm. She is a woman of substantial regrets. Though she is currently in a solid long-term relationship, it has been some time since she has experienced real sexual fulfillment.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

COURTNEY
Is grandfather's lakehouse a locus for her sexual regrets?

JOEL
Could be.

CURTIS
Maybe they're not directly related, but they've become linked in her mind somehow.

COURTNEY
Sure, that would be funny.

JOEL
That would be really funny.

CURTIS
I'll write it down.

[ He makes a note. ]

CURTIS
I’m circling the words “grandfather’s house,” and next to it I’m drawing a graphic image of two people having intercourse, and next to that I’m drawing a sad face.

COURTNEY
I’ll add that to the key.

[ She begins doodling, looking over to Curtis’s note. ]

COURTNEY
“Locus of sexual regret.” Got it.

JOEL
What do you guys think of the sketch so far?

COURTNEY
So far, I definitely think it's funny, but I'd like to see where it goes.

JOEL
I'd like to see where you go! I'm sorry. I 100% guarantee that that won't happen again. There was absolutely nothing in your statement to make me mad.

CURTIS
Let's continue.

JOEL [ reading ]
The bank teller sighs.

COURTNEY [ sighs, reading in a Puerto Rican accent ]
This pad thai is no good.

[ Joel raises his hand. ]

COURTNEY
I’m trying to feel this out.

JOEL
I definitely don’t want the Puerto Rican accent. Can I be honest? I had a feeling you were going to do it, and that’s why I said not to do it earlier.

COURTNEY
I appreciate your honesty.

CURTIS
Courtney, are there any other accents that you like to do?

COURTNEY No.

CURTIS
Well, that could be a problem.

COURTNEY
Well, how about this? I could keep the accent, but you could cut my dialogue.

CURTIS
That way, you both win.

JOEL
I don’t know. Your dialogue is pretty important to the sketch.

CURTIS
Joel, instead of defending against new ideas, we should be willing to try them and see if they work.

JOEL
OK. We’ll try it without you having any dialogue.

COURTNEY
But with me having a Puerto Rican accent.

CURTIS
You both win!

JOEL
OK

[ Reading. ]

JOEL
An organ grinder enters the bank, all suspenders and mustachios. He is a quirky fellow with a spring in his step. He carries an organ, but a thin leash dangles from his wrist with no monkey on the end. He does not look at the leash. Perhaps he does not even note the absence of his monkey. Perhaps he knows his monkey’s whereabouts. Perhaps he never even had a monkey at all.

CURTIS
I like this ambiguity.

JOEL
It’s funny, isn’t it?

COURTNEY
It is funny!

JOEL [ reading ]
The organ grinder approaches the teller, who regards him warily.

COURTNEY
And we cut the line here.

JOEL
OK, so it’s your line.

CURTIS [ reading, Puerto Rican accent ]
I’d like to make a deposit.

JOEL & COURTNEY
Good choice.

CURTIS
Thanks!

JOEL
Do it again.

CURTIS
I’d like to make a deposit.

[ Courtney and Joel look at each other, shake their heads. ]

COURTNEY
No, lose it.

CURTIS
I’m trying to feel it out.

[ Courtney shakes her head. ]

JOEL
Start over.

CURTIS [ reading ]
I’d like to make a withdrawal.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Yes, here’s my withdrawal slip.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Yes, it’s been a fine day for me.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
What do you mean?

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. Curtis laughs. ]

CURTIS
Not at all.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Oh no, he’s back at the office.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

JOEL [ reading ]
The teller reaches beneath the counter and pulls out a large bag of peanuts. She places them on the counter. The organ grinder takes them.

CURTIS [ reading ]
I guess I better get back. The boss hates it when I’m late.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

JOEL [ reading ]
A look of quiet desolation settles over the teller’s face. So it’s as simple as that, then, she seems to think. Lights down, slowly. Then, lights back up again. And then, more slowly this time, lights down again. And then, a tiny shaft of light. Then that fades slowly. Then, three sound cues, which are yet to be determined.

[ Joel starts giggling. ]

JOEL
Man, I think that the things that I write are good.

[ He starts reading again. ]

JOEL
OK, now: act one, scene two.

[ Curtis and Courtney both raise their hands. ]

JOEL
Guys, please. It should only be another couple of hours, and then we can do notes.

CURTIS
I have a question about why my accent was disallowed.

COURTNEY
I think there are five things about this scene that don’t work. One, bra stuff. Two, I don’t have lines anymore. Three, too long. Four, too stagey. Five, it sucks more than anything ever and isn’t funny.

JOEL
You suck more than anything ever and aren’t funny! I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. No I’m not!

CURTIS
Guys, this is getting heated. I want you to have a friendship hug, right now.

[ Joel and Courtney get up and hug reluctantly. ]

CURTIS
That’s better.

JOEL
OK.

COURTNEY
OK.

JOEL
I’ve cooled down a bit. I’ve really thought about what you have to say.

COURTNEY
I appreciate that.

JOEL
And I really think we ought to break up the troupe.

COURTNEY
You always say that.

JOEL
But I mean it this time. I feel like there are places I need to go, creatively, and you guys aren’t willing to follow me there.

COURTNEY
I respect your decision, Joel.

JOEL
You don’t understand. I’m quitting the troupe.

CURTIS
Joel, we both hear you. And I think we’re in agreement here: We respect your decision to quit the troupe.

JOEL
Fine, because I’m quitting.

COURTNEY
Yes, Joel.

JOEL
Fine.

[ Joel heads to the door, but then he stops and waits with his hand on the doorknob. ]

COURTNEY [ to Curtis ]
Should we stop him?

CURTIS
No. We have to let him go this time. We have to let him go.

[ They hold hands tightly, close their eyes. Joel sniffs. Joel makes a low, moaning sound. Curtis and Courtney hold each other’s hands even more tightly. Finally, after an awkward pause, Joel leaves. ]

COURTNEY [ to audience ]
And that’s how the reading works. We read the sketch together, we offer suggestions, and then Joel quits the troupe.

CURTIS
Do you think he’ll come back, Courtney?

COURTNEY
He will. He’s stuck backstage. He has nowhere to go.

JOEL [ offstage ]
I still don’t like this sketch.

[ MUSIC: Tales from The Crypt intro ]

[ Curtis runs back and forth across the stage, tosses spiders and cobwebs at the audience. Grabs a bowl of grapes, makes some people touch them, until …. ]

[ Gladys St. Taco pops out of a coffin (a large cardboard box with “coffin” written on it). ]

GLADYS [ reading puns off of cards ]
Hey. Whatever. Welcome to tonight’s episode of Your Terrific Neighbors. I’m Gladys St. Taco, troubled pop chanteuse slash suicidal Americana icon slash trashy sexy model songwriter. Also, I’m dating Slash. He reminds me of my weird dad. I’ll be your guide through this dark boring night of terrors. I think we’re going to have a “bloody” good time. Whatever. Is it Halloween? No.

[ Picks up a golf club. ]

GLADYS
Do you like stories about golf buddies? How about stories about golf buddies going nuts? Join the “club.” I’m supposed to cackle but I what’s the point. I wish I was in a dumpster. To “putt” it lightly, tonight’s tale is about a woman who goes “out of bounds” to be successful and start making that “green.” Why am I doing this? Of “course,” she’s not alone in this story; there are “links” to other people’s fates. Ugh. I hope you think it’s a “hole in one.” I don’t know what that means. Anyway, that’s not where our story begins. First, we’re going to “tee off” with a mother and her son, who seem to have lost track of time. Courtney’s going to stop playing me and start playing the mom now, that’s why I’m changing clothes, that’s what this whole “thing” is about. It’s stupid. I’ll be back at the end of the show because of structure, if I don’t “follow through” with my threats to “putt” myself out of my misery first. I already did a “putt” pun. I’m sad.

[ MUSIC: Ren faire music ]

[ A mother and son, two Ren Faire workers, are leaning against a tree. He plays with a concertina. ]

SON
Mother, when is the Mud Show?

MOTHER
My darling, if I’ve told you once, I’ve told you a thousand times, the Mud Show is at 4:45.

SON
Mother, why hasn’t the Mud Show happened yet?


MOTHER
It will happen at 4:45.

SON
But mother, certainly it has been 4:45 by now.

MOTHER
If it had been 4:45, my son, the Mud Show would have happened.

[ The boy plays the concertina and then stops ]

SON
Mother, how do we know the mud show is at 4:45?

MOTHER
Because it has been prophesied, my love. The great one came down from on high and scrawled uponst a plank of wood “Mud Show at 1:30, 3 and 4:45” then glued that plank to a stake and stuck it into the ground for all to read and know.

SON
What was the mud show at 1:30 like, mother?

MOTHER
It was glorious, filled with pratfalls and witty puns.

SON
Mother, what was the 3pm show like?

MOTHER
It was good in its own way, not as energetic as the 1:30 show but with a more steady, concentrated pace.

SON
I wish I could remember the mud shows.

[ SOUND: Golf swing. ]

SON
Mother, look out!

MOTHER [ protects him with her body ]
Fore, my child! Regard thee of this fore! Shakespeare language!

[ Someone throws a golf ball at the stage. ]

MOTHER
Fourteen years we have been here. Fourteen years ago a servant of a foreign king cameth unto our lands and said he wished to appropriate it for a game.

SON
A course! A course, he said, but not for a meal but a bit of jest!

MOTHER
That’s right, my young son.

SON
The Golf Course, right, Mother?

MOTHER
Yes, my son, the Golf Course.

SON
What happened when the developers from foreign lands came and told us we’d have to abandon our homes?

MOTHER
We stayed. We stayed and showed them that we were not people that would simply let our lands be taken from us, the beautiful lands of the Sherwood Forest Faire. Twenty three acres of authentic Renaissance era entertainment! Fire eaters! Stilt walkers! The “Dragon’s Den” e-Cigarette Vaping Lounge, sponsored by Blu! Miles and miles of the weirdest cleavage you’ve ever laid your eyes on, what the scholars call Ren Faire Boob!

SON
But they built the Golf Course, anyway, right, Mother?

MOTHER
They did. Now we live in this forest hazard, secretive, silent, like the animals in the trees, or the crabs and lizard people who dwell beneath the sand traps.

[ he plays the concertina ]

SON
Mother, tell me about the time your corset burst!

MOTHER
No!

[ She claps. Awkward beat. Curtis moves his face closer. Courtney slaps him. ]

MOTHER
No! It is not for your ears! Anyhow, it is too sad a story to repeat.

[ he plays the concertina ]

SON
Did Father leave us to join the Game of Golf?

MOTHER
He did, my son, he did. He left and became a businessman, a businessman who takes others under his wing so that they may one day be businessmen, too. One day, it is foretold that he will return to us for the 4:45 mud show. But until then, he provides for us. Every few days he takes a nine iron and volleys a basket of buffalo wings our way.

SON
Sometimes I hear him curse, early in the morning. I hear the crack of the club against the ball and then a stream of words so vile it hurts my ears to hear them.

MOTHER
I hear them too, my son. They are the sound of a man going nuts.

SON
Mother, what happened to Danielle?

MOTHER
We speak not of Danielle.

SON
Mother, I had a sister, did I not?

MOTHER
We don’t speak of Danielle.

SON
Mother, was Danielle carried off by the falcons the falconer left behind?

MOTHER
Let us not speak of this.


SON
But mother, the falconer left, didn’t he? He left without his falcons.

MOTHER
If the man left without his falcons, then he is no falconer.

SON
He left a falcon, he left its hood on. One day Danielle and I found it. We took its hood off. The next day Danielle was gone.

MOTHER
That man is no falconer.

[ Pause. The following is rapid fire. ]

SON
Mother, what’s a goth?

MOTHER
Inside folk.

SON
Mother, what is glass blowing?

MOTHER
The noblest of professions.

SON
Mother, what is a Trekkie?

MOTHER
An interloper who thinks he is clever.

SON
Mother, what is steampunk?

MOTHER
Blasphemy.

SON
Mother, what is vaping?

MOTHER
A rad thing that is cool to do anywhere.

SON
Mother, did you lie with a juggler after father left?

MOTHER
Slap!

[ Awkward pause. Curtis leans in, Courtney slaps him. ]

MOTHER
Oh, my son, I am too weary for any more questions. Would that we had some sustenance to maintain us, like in the golden days! Some Kettle Corn, a Lemon Chill or a Gyro bowl! AAARRGGH, the pangs of hunger joust me!

SON
Hark, mother! Two golfaniers approacheth! Shakespeake!

MOTHER
Into the forest hazard retreat we now! Shakespeare away!

ALL
Chaaaaange clothes!

[ Switch to two golfers. ]

[ M takes a basket of wings and hits it offstage with a club. ]

M
Fore!!

[ Whispering. ]

M
Eat well today, my dear ones.

[ Back to business. ]

M
Do you know why I brought you here?

W
It’s a third interview for a vice president-level position. First interview is a phone call from a moving BMW. Second interview is over lunch where we drink three alcohol drinks, have six bites of cobb salad, and leave the waiter a stamp for a tip to remind him of his place.

M
And …?

W
And a note that says, “Here’s a stamp. Send a letter to your mom and tell her that you’re still a loser. Remember your place! Love, two businesspeople.”

M
Businessmen. And now...

W
Third interview is over golf.

M
Third interview is always over golf. Do you know why you made it this far, Danielle?

W
I’m a strong woman who leans in and does serious business things.

M
You know, long ago, in a different life, I had a daughter named Danielle.

W
That probably wasn’t me.

M
Probably not. Are you divisional vice president of emerging markets material, Danielle? Are you a strong enough woman to become a true businessman?

W
I am a strong female character. I am great at karate and dedicated to my mission. I am strong enough as a woman to be a man, like the deodorant I wear. And, like I said, I lean the fuck in.

M
Good profanity! You’re the first woman to ever even step on this golf course, Danielle. Look around you. The golf course is for men. A sacred place where buddies can go nuts together.

W
I want to go nuts, like a real golf buddy!

M
Being buddies and going nuts is a privilege of the greens. Do you know where the word golf comes from, Danielle? It’s an acronym, actually. It means gentlemen only, ladies forbidden.

W
That’s a myth. I looked it up on Snopes dot com.

M
Snopes dot com is controlled by businessmen, Danielle. Dot com. Dot commercial. Commerce. Business. Businessmen.

W
Snap!

M
Snopes dot com gives American business power over truth and myth. You will learn of this and other mysteries, if you have what it takes. Do you know why ladies are traditionally forbidden from the golf course, Danielle?

W
I’m sure we did something to deserve it.

M
The links are a garden. Long ago, Danielle, there was another garden, where two golf buddies went nuts whenever they liked. They were named Adam and Steve.

W
I KNEW it was Adam and Steve, but church people kept telling me that it wasn’t.

M
One day, Steve sliced badly and cursed God. In retribution, God gave him a womb to sicken his mind and turn him toward evil. From that day, he was known as Eve. Because of Eve’s sickly womb, Eden’s 18 holes were lost. Do you understand?

W
I do.

[ SOUND: Phone ring ]

W
Wait, one second.

[ Answers phone. ]

W [ on phone ]
Hello? What’s that? Ugh. Sweetie, listen, I won’t have this conversation with you until you update your software. Just push the button and do it. Well, plug it in, then.

[ Hangs up. ]

W
I’m sorry for taking that call. It was my idiot, feminized husband asking weak, stupid questions about dinner.

M
It is your right as a businessman to take calls! Just as this is MY right …

[ Pulls out an e-cig and starts vaping. ]

W
What a great thing to do here.

M
This is a great thing to do anywhere!

W
There’s no reason not to do that any place.

M
Now, do you understand why I was hesitant to bring you here?

W
Yes. As a woman, I am unlike an e-cigarette. I don’t belong everywhere.

M
Good.

W
But perhaps, as a strong woman who knows karate and yells at her husband, I can become more than a woman. Let me update you on my current feelings about golf. I love it. I enjoy it. I feel myself becoming more of a businessman every moment. I feel the power of business flowing through my club, into my hands, making me stronger.

M
Holesekeer. You can call it a golf club once you belong to the golf club. Otherwise, the correct term is “holeseeker.”

W
I feel my holeseeker making me strong. I feel my womb melting away. With every swing, I feel business taking its place in my belly.

[ She swings the club. ]

W
Out with the womb, in with the business.

M
Yes! These are the words of a divisional vice president of emerging markets. Tell me a little bit about how you got into business.

W
Sure. The year was 1999...

[ W tilts her head. ]

[ VIDEO: 1999 one ]

W [ voiceover ]
1999. It was a hot one. Twilight of the Clinton years. The 90s were a party that we thought would never stop. The internet was changing the way we thought about sending e-mail and downloading things. Businesswomen like myself were being hired for serious business jobs. American Beauty was in theaters, and a lot of people liked that at the time, but they don’t think about it anymore. Also, all the movies that came out at that time. 1999! Man, we thought the party would never end. The Euro was established. Hugo Chavez became president of Venezuela. It was just like ocean under the moon. And when I shut my eyes, I go right back there, man, right back to that blessed year. Why, I can almost see it now. Almost. Man, why can’t I see anymore? Was my eyesight a victim of those halcyon days? Was it the notorious Y2K switchover bug that robbed me of my sight? Oh well, at least I learned to fake it. Also: The Phantom Menace!

[ W tilts her head back. She’s back to normal. ]

W
1999. That was my year, man. Also, it was the year I was found by a kindly group of monks. I had amnesia and was living in an oversized falcon’s nest eating raw field mice. At some point in all this I got involved in business but who cares about the details, really?

M
This golf course has been here since 1999. Before that …

[ He gazes into the distance. ]

M
Hmmm. Huh. Aaaaah. Hm.

W
It was what? Why are you gazing?

M
I can’t say! Hmmmmmmmmmm.

[ SOUND: Phone ring ]

W
Hold on a second.

[ Answers phone. ]

W [ on phone ]
I don’t care if it takes 20 minutes. Update it. I can’t keep talking like this. I can tell the difference. It’s in “Settings”!

[ Hangs up. ]

W
Am I too hard on him?

M
No. As businessman of the house, you are the commander of all operating systems. Danielle, would you believe it if I told you that business fate had brought you here today?

W
Sure.

M
You don’t think business fate is just … a beautiful dream? Something out of story books?

W
Snopes dot com says that some story books are real books.

M
What are you reading right now?

W
The Crabs. It’s a by-turns ironic and heartbreaking story of two generations of a Maryland fishing family. I basically only read serious contemporary fiction.

M
Really? I’m reading American Colossus, a 2,000-page biography of John Rockefeller. I pretty much only read extremely detailed scholarly biographies of major historical figures.

W
Really? I’m reading The Star Commissars. It’s about some stars that are the bosses of other stars, and the consequences of that. I only read cult sci-fi.

M
Really? I’m reading Power Force. It’s a collection of comics where the superheroes are assholes and commit ultraviolence against children and old people. I only read really gritty comics.

W
Really? I’m reading Sweet Valley Mummies. It’s about these mummies and the teenagers who love them, in spite of the ever-present threat of curses. I only read young adult books that are too stupid for young adults.

M
Really? I’m reading Animal A-Z. It’s a recounting of the alphabet through the lens of different animal names. I prefer to read books designed for toddlers. The simplicity of their messages appeals to me.

W
I only look at pictures, these days.

M
I don’t even understand pictures.

W
I prefer to have an older person describe them to me, yes. I like books that I can feel. With textures. I like books of carpet swatches.

M
I like to chew on the spines of books.

W
This is fun!

M
Business life is packed with intellectual conversations of this kind. They separate us from the lesser people. The serfs, the peons, those who toil with their hands.

W [ pointing ]
Like those peons.

M
Those caddies?

W
Hmmm...no. Cubbies. I choose to call them cubbies.

M
Excellent! They are whatever you wish them to be.

W
I wonder what kind of garbage their little cubbie minds are occupied with.

M
Let’s find out.

[ They switch to being caddies. ]

CUBBY 1
Ugh, man. Picking up balls.

CUBBY 2
Yup.

CUBBY 1
Pickin’ up balls, all day and all night.

CUBBY 2
That’s what we do.

CUBBY 1
Toiling with our dumb hands.

CUBBY 2
Yup.

CUBBY 1
Let’s have a conversation. Have you seen that great action horror film, The Urge?

CUBBY 2
I’ve saw a trailer for the The Urge. Is it good?

CUBBY 1
It’s so good. You have to see it. In my opinion, it’s the direction this country is headed in if we don’t wake up and open our eyes.

CUBBY 2
Wow, that does sound pretty good. What’s it about?

[ MUSIC: Scary futuristic music. ]

CUBBY 1
Well, in the not too distant future of next year the United States has been taken over by the New George Washingtons. Crime is at an all-time low because fast food, candy, and sodas have been outlawed. You see, all along, it was the sugar and the salt and the fat that was making everyone kill and rape each other all the time. But there’s one day a year when everyone can eat as many of these things as they want.

CUBBY 2
Whoa.

CUBBY 1
Yeah. To get it out of their systems or whatever. And it totally works! It’s a 12-hour period every year beginning on at 4:45 on the Summer Solstice. Each year every town nominates three fools to jump into a giant mud pit in the center of the town, as sort of an offering. Then the New George Washington government airdrops a massive pile of hamburgers and fries and cokes and candies into the mud pit, on top of the fools. Gangs of bad guys go out and kill people for the junk food they’ve collected and real rich people will pay poor people like $100,000 to get a candy bar for them.

CUBBY 2
Wow.

CUBBY 1
And all night everyone is taking pictures of the food that they stole or they had stolen for them and it crashes Instagram and they have to shut Instagram down. They have to shut it down during The Urge.

CUBBY 2
Fuck!

CUBBY 1
They shut Instagram down for 12 hours.

[ MUSIC STOPS ]

CUBBY 2
That sounds like a really amazing film. It really sounds like the kind of future that you and I might have to experience in our lifetimes, if we don’t stop drinking the kool aid and realize what’s going on.

CUBBY 1
All the people in the gangs wear powdered wigs and wooden teeth so you don’t know who anyone is. It could be your neighbors.

CUBBY 2
It’s like real life YouTube.

CUBBY 1
You know what I think? I think it’s real.

CUBBY 2
One of those real movies? Like Webcam Ghost Murders?

CUBBY 1
Yup, or Gattaca, or the Michael Jackson Moonwalker video. It seemed like something that could happen. An actual real thing that could actually occur in our country if we don’t get off of our portable devices and find out what’s going on.

CUBBY 2
But is it happening right now? I don’t understand.

CUBBY 1
Maybe it’s a real movie from the future. A warning from ourselves. A real movie to tell us what might happen to us if we don’t stop and realize that life happens more than 140 characters at a time.

CUBBY 2
Yeah, like chemtrails. [takes some candy out of his pocket and starts eating it]

CUBBY 1
Exactly! We’re too busy trying to all share the same HBO Go password to really see what’s happening under our noses! [notices the candy ] What are you doing?! Don’t you understand that’s what they want you to do? To get fat and lazy so you can’t run when The Urge comes? You’ll be the first to go! There are no fat people in The Urge because they’re tortured and killed once a year for their candy-like fat stores!

CUBBY 2
Come on, it’s just a twizzler. Calm down.

CUBBY 1
Give me that.  [ snatches the Twizzler from CUBBY 2 and holds it in his face ] Sometimes the only person that can save us from ourselves is someone else. That’s a quote from The Urge.

CUBBY 2
Fine! Come on, there are some balls over in that forest hazard.

CUBBY 1
Jesus! Haven’t you heard about the ghost of the forest hazard?

CUBBY 2
That’s not a real story.

CUBBY 1
That’s not what I heard.

[  MUSIC: Ghostly music. ]

CUBBY 1
You see, it all started with a haunted webcam--

[ MUSIC STOPS ]

[ They walk off. Then turn back into the golfers. ]

M
Businessmen have enemies, Danielle.

W
Yes?

M
Yes. Those who want to spoil our greens and unleash moral corruption on our way of life. Women who would taint us with their sickly wombs--non-businessman women.

[ SOUND: Phone ring ]

W
Hold on a second.

[ Answers phone. ]

W [ on phone ]
Just update the OS on your phone. Please, it’s barbaric talking to you while you’re using that old OS. You’re weak, and I’m going to cheat on you a lot.

[ Hangs up. ]

W
Was that good?

M
Gooooooood! You will see many prostitutes on sales trips! To be a businessman, Danielle, is to be a guardian of God’s truth against the forces of feminism, socialism, and sodomy.

W
I’m into it.

M
For instance, our company denies female employees contraceptive access as part of their health plans. Do you know why?

W
We employ over 2000 women. It would be irresponsible to have a health plan that requires them to take plan B every day, just because that’s what this Democratic administration wants. If they have the right to make us act against our religious conscience, they have the right to put special fluid into the water that makes everyone have abortions every day.

M
Good, Danielle, good. I would like to share something with you now, a secret only a businessman would have access to. Listen to this secret tape wherein American president Barack Obama confesses to his many crimes.

W
Damn, son, where’d you find this?

M
There are some really cool sites on the internet where businessmen exchange the newest and hottest secret tapes detailing the crimes of liberals. This tape was found and produced by Reverend Todd Gilchips. Let’s listen.

[ M holds up a cassette tape. ]

[ SOUND: Obama tape ]

W [ voiceover, but all of the words here are obscured by “DJ drops” and gratuitous sound effects  ]
Hello, this is President Barack Obama, just talking to my wife Michelle here in this empty room and sharing my true feelings about white American Christians. Boy oh boy, have I ever had enough of these whities. Thank goodness my Obama healthcare plan has all of these secret clauses that will help me to get rid of them. By sterilizing white people, killing their elders, and financing research to create a whiteness vaccine, I will finally rid this country of white Christians. Then I will pass a second stimulus plan that will turn everyone into Muslims. This is a pretty good plan, Michelle.

[ M puts tape away. ]

W
Wow, that’s pretty incriminating.

M
I know. I’ve got a hot Benghazi mix in the car. We’ll listen to that later.

[ W takes a bad swing. ]

W
Son of a damn it! I’m sorry. Some of my womb is still there. I shouldn’t speak so freely on the golf course. I just went nuts.

M
Perhaps the time has come for you to go nuts.

W
Should I?

M
Danielle, throwing a golf temper tantrum is every businessman’s right.

W
I want to be a businessman.


M
Then claim your right. Go nuts, like a golf buddy would.

W
What do I do?

M
You have many options before you. Do you violently dress down a cubby? Do you proclaim your putter a “piece of worthless shit” and break it over your knee? Do you have a furious and frustrating one-sided altercation with a shrub or tree? Perhaps you make snow angels in a bunker. Who am I to say how your god-given right to a golf meltdown will go?

W
What was your first golf meltdown like?

M
It was a magic time. I had put my ball into a water hazard for the third time that morning. I was apoplectic. I ripped the flag from the hole and used it to skewer a cubby. I relieved him of the bag he was carrying for me and used it and the clubs inside to bludgeon him. I then returned to the golf cart, a rather zippy model, and ran down my golf buddy and mentor. Then I ripped a sapling from the ground and whipped him relentlessly until the flesh peeled back from his buttocks. I still remember his groans of proud agony--proud because I had finally surpassed him. His work on this earth completed, he dissolved into a wisp of cool and location-appropriate e-vapor. All that was left on the green was his cameo. Now I wear it. It is the sign of a true businessman.

W
That’s beautiful. A fancy Victorian lady. It makes you look like a fancy Victorian lady.

M
Thank you.

W
I want it. I feel myself hypnotized by its businesslike beauty.

M
You have not earned it! Focus your efforts on your golf course meltdown! What will you do?! How will you do it?! Where will your furies be focused? On whom?! There is no time! You must go nuts right now!

W
Shut up! Shut up! Stop screaming at me! I am strong, strong as a businessman now! Do you know what that means?! I feel the spirits of businessmen past entering my body! It means I am now filled with the unbridled and pent up rage of all businessmen before me! I feel the anger of every businessman that has been stuck in commoner traffic. I feel the sadness of every businessman who has been lost, stuck at the office waiting for that call from Japan. I feel the orgiastic ecstasy of every businessman who has humiliated an underling in front of a boardroom filled with very powerful people!

M
Embrace it! Going nuts is the final stage in your ascension! Say it!

W [ Starts swinging club around ]
I’m going nuts!

M
You will be vice-president! Say it!

W
I will be divisional vice president of emerging markets!

M
Louder!

W
I will be rid of this stupid womb! I will reach my full potential as a strong woman! I will do karate and frown at people! I will get revenge on slash approval from the father I never knew, the one who abandoned me on the golf course, leaving me at the mercy of falcons and fickle fate!

M
Wait. Danielle?

W
Silence!

[ She stabs him with her club. ]

W
Oh no. I stabbed you with my club. That’s what just happened.

M
Remember when I said you were probably not my daughter Danielle? I think that was wrong. Now that I have some more key pieces of telling information, I think you are her.


W
Dad? Oh no. I found you and then I killed you. I’m having complicated, womb-like feelings about this!

M
No, no. It is fitting. The cycle is complete. You are a true businessman.

[ Gives cameo from around his neck. ]

M
This … is yours now.

W
This reminds me of that band Cameo. You know, I thought that song “Word Up” was by Devo for the longest time.

M
Napster. EVERYONE mislabeled their MP3s.

W
1999.....

[ VIDEO: 1999 two ]

W [ v/o ]
1999. Napster had come to America, and file-sharing was all the rage. I’m downloading every Metallica album there is, just to throw a middle finger at Lars Ulrich. I don’t even like their stuff! Except for “Sad But True”, I’m gonna play that one while I get dressed. Wait, where did I save that MP3? What is it called? Is it on my desktop? Or on my hard drive? Where is my hard drive? Is it called my computer? Or my documents? Perhaps I burnt it to a CD-Rom. Man, this is a hot one.

M
We used to listen to Word Up … While we were heating the turkey legs.

W
It was our favorite song. The best song. Except for “Sad But True”.

[ MUSIC: Don’t Wanna Miss a Thing ]

M
Danielle, listen closely. Somewhere in this course … Your mother and brother still live. It was a simple plan. I was to find a new livelihood, something to sustain the family in the darkness before the promised coming of the 4:45 mud show. But I … lost my way. Got wrapped up in business, business, always business.

[ W begins making “wrap it up” motions. ]

M
Find them if you can. I’m dying, Danielle. This burden now passes to you... Mr. Vice President.

W
Wait! No! Father. You can’t die like this. You were going to comp our lunches!

[ M, during his dying groan, takes another e-cigarette drag and blows it out. ]

M
So goes my soul, into the air.

W
What a cool, great way to die.

[ Shouts. ]

W
You! Over there in the tree hazard! Caddies! I mean cabbies! I mean, cubbies! Come quick! This man’s body is probably heavy.

[ They become Caddies. Curtis just shifts to another position on the ground, Courtney switches to holding him in another position. ]

CUBBY 1
I’m dying too!

CUBBY 2
What? OK.

CUBBY 1
It was one of the New George Washingtons! He was dressed all old timey and he smelled like someone who didn’t have air conditioning! He killed me for the candy I took from you to save you from yourself.

CUBBY 2
Oh god! Oh god, you were right, it was one of those real movies!

CUBBY 1
Or maybe it was the webcam ghost of the forest hazard….

CUBBY 2
Nah.

CUBBY 1
OK. Promise me something.

CUBBY 2
Yes?

CUBBY 1
Promise me you won’t let the New George Washingtons take over.

CUBBY 2
What am I supposed to do?

CUBBY 1
Open your eyes! Stop drinking the Red Bull and go off the grid! Don’t let them take you to debtors prison! Blog everything, blog about everything you’ve seen here today!

CUBBY 2
I swear to you, as your fellow caddy--

CUBBY 1
Cubby. We are Cubbies now.

CUBBY 2
Cubby. As you fellow cubby and brother in blood, I will make a blog post for all to see. I will open my eyes.

[ They hold hands. CUBBY 2 closes her eyes and CUBBY 1 opens his ]

CUBBY 1
Is it beautiful? Looking at the world with your eyes open?

CUBBY 2
It’s beautiful.

[ Dies with a puff of vape. ]

[ They become Ren Fair people. This time Courtney is dying, and Curtis is holding her. ]

SON
Mother! Your pains of hunger end now! I have slain one of the foreign ballmen and seized his novelty candy!

MOTHER
It is too late, my son, I am also dying.

SON
You mustn’t!

MOTHER
My time has come, my son. I think I’m dying from either starvation or food poisoning, it’s hard to tell. There may have been something wrong with that bleu cheese dressing. Ah, how I wish I could have made it a little longer. I would have liked to see the 4:45 mud show.

SON
Mother, please. You can’t leave me. Father hasn’t returned. I’ll be lost.

MOTHER
One day, when the 4:45 Mud Show begins, my son, he will return. He will return to us and the Sherwood Forest Faire will return to its full glory. You will recognize him by the cameo that he wears upon his neck, my son.

SON
We used to listen to “Word Up” as we heated up the turkey legs….

MOTHER
The best song. Except for “Sad But True”.

[ She dies with a puff of vape. ]

[ Son cries. Courtney changes back into businesswoman. Their eyes meet in the middle of the stage. Curtis sees the cameo. ]

W
You’re probably my lost brother.

SON
You’re probably my father!

W
Well….

[ Suddenly, a Baby Ruth bar protrudes through the son. ]

SON
Oh god! Someone skewered me from behind with a baby ruth bar. That’s what just happened.

W
Noooooooo, my brother! My beautiful brother. You were probably so interesting. I don’t really remember you.

SON
Who did this to meeeeee?

[ Spins around to become Cubby. ]

CUBBY 2
I did this! I’m hopped up on candy-based ultraviolence. NO RULES! SOCIAL ORDER--UPSIDE DOWN!

W
Get back in your place, Cubby! I know karate!

[ They throw candy at each other out of a big stupid bucket. ]

W
Oh no! Dead.

CUBBY 2
Now to ransack your corpse.

[ He takes the cameo. ]

CUBBY 2
Good god. This looks like a beautiful Victorian lady … who looks like George Washington. George … Washington … me … the urge … the urge … me … George Washington. MY GOD, WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT HAVE I BECOME!!

[ LIGHTS OUT ]

[ MUSIC: second Tales from The Crypt ]

[ LIGHTS UP ]

GLADYS
Well, that was a “ball.” That guy became the very thing that he was scared of. That’s an irony. Did you catch all the other ironies? They were all in there. What about the twist? Cuz there were three of them. One, it’s a post-apocalyptic world. Did you notice? Two, those people were all in a computer simulation. They’re sims. Did you catch that? Three, the simulation is being played in hell. By the devil. So, was it scary? It sure “drove” me to distraction. I guess. Anyhow, I’m going back in my coffin.

CUBBY 1
You don't know about the ghost of the forest hazard?

CUBBY 2
Ghost? Come on. There's no such thing as ghosts. It's all a bunch of fake stories for children.

CUBBY 1
Oh, there aren't, huh? I guess you've never heard the tale of the ghost of the forest hazard.

CUBBY 2
Tale? Come on. There's no such thing as tales. It's all a bunch of fake stories for children.

CUBBY 1
Not this time. This tale is a real story.

CUBBY 2
Like a real movie.

CUBBY 1
Like a real movie, but in the form of words that I'm about to say.

CUBBY 2
You're scaring me.

CUBBY 1
Good! It started on an afternoon much like this one. Partly cloudly, with highs in the low 80s. Lovely day, really. The breeze was blowing at about 5 miles per hour south-southwest, and barometric pressure was low. Surprisingly low, really, for a day in the springtime, which it was. Visibility was at 10 miles, and the dew point held steady at 73 degrees fahrenheit.

CUBBY 2
What a lovely day.

CUBBY 1
Really, it was. Which is why Lorne, a cubby that I once knew, could not have possibly suspected the fate that would await him that day. His player that day was a very important businessman, a private prison contractor executive who would give Lorne aggressively high tips after verbally abusing him, and in doing so, remind Lorne of his place twice. Lorne didn't mind, though--he could use the money. After his player hit a bad slice into the forest hazard, Lorne's heart lightened. It cheered him to think of walking through the trees on such a lovely day as this day. Once within the hazard, though, Lorne seemed to lose all track of time. Familiar turns in the forest grew steadily unfamiliar. It was a though the forest was twisting and changing with every step. Lorne took a moment to rest against a tree, and when he recovered his strength, resolved to set out again in search of the ball, he stopped suddenly. His player's bag and clubs, which he had been carrying but a moment before, were gone.

CUBBY 2
Oh no!

CUBBY 1
Fear gripped Lorne's heart. How was this possible? A low moan seemed to whisper through the trees. Was it just the wind, blowing at five miles per hour south-southwest, or was it something else? Was it the seductive keening of a ghost, eager to lure Lorne into the world beyond the grave and make him its ghost-bridegroom? Was it lowing of a goblin, hungry for Lorne's bones? These and other supernatural possibilities filled Lorne's terrified mind. Lorne raced in circles. Eventually, he emerged from the forest hazard. Relief flooded his veins, but then a new fear: what would he tell his player, whose clubs he had lost? But then ... there the were, sitting in their bag, undisturbed, waiting for Lorne at the margin of the forest hazard: his player's bag and clubs, intact. The ghost, it seems, was something of a cubby itself.

CUBBY 2
Huh. Well, that's pretty spooky, I guess, but not really all-out terrifying or anything.

CUBBY 1
I'm not finished. Soon after, the ghost appeared before Lorne and tortured him to death slowly over the course of 12 hours. It was *sick,* dude. That part was *sick.* He cut off his wang and all of his balls. Sick.

CUBBY 2
Why didn't you...

CUBBY 1
He worked him over from toe to ear, in that direction, using these horrible little tools that he had. Totally sick, dude.


I found this in the Book of Cubbies.

let’s go rubbin’ that frog’s belly
Santana’s “Smooth” (maybe the show is set in 1999, and this is our way of setting the scene)
or maybe at one point, Courtney is asked to talk about her past, and she looks thoughtful as the sound cue plays
Courtney narrating “”
“Let’s listen to this tape detailing the crimes of American president Barack Obama.” -- MAYBE NOT!
Courtney speaking as President Obama
there are too many “DJ drops” on the tape, making it unlistenable: “D-D-D-D-D-D-DJ Tom Gilcrist. *STEAM WHISTLE* This tape’s hot! Good gravy, junior, where’d you get this tape?”
the scene of unofficial religious right mixtapes on the internet (like rap mixtapes, get it?)
ties back to the weird cassette tapes that the RR used to leave at gas stations and such (about how Bill Clinton was a cocaine addict, and how he and Hillary had killed a dude, etc.)
hmmm now my head is stuck in the late 90s! what else is from the late 90s?
Faith Hill songs
“I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing” -- love song from Armageddon
America Online
Woodstock ‘99
all those movies that came out then
Whoomp There It Is (wait, this is from 1993)
COLUMBINE :(

Installer package
wookie life debt
cameos
the mark of a true businessman … a sweet cameo of your very own
cameo the band!
“I thought Word Up was by Devo for the longest time.”
Napster, man. EVERYONE mislabeled their MP3s!
That’s right … (another 1999 reminiscence)
scene in 2001 where the monkeys go crazy, but they keep going back to business talk...
talk of business makes them more simian with their golf clubs
gypsies who live in a golf course, in the woods … they have been lost from a ren fair

“The prophecies tell us that one day the 4:45 mud show will return.”
“Our corsets burst.”
Tron



REN FAIR WORKERS TELL A TALE

[ Two ren fair workers sit against a tree, the woman is playing a concertina ]

W
Three years ago, all that you see here in front of you was a ren fair.

M
This I know to be true.

W
We know this to be true.

[ she plays the concertina ]

M
23 acres of somewhat authentic Renaissance era entertainment!

W
Fire eaters!

M
Stilt walkers!

W
Cleverly concealed modern conveniences!

M
Like flushing toilets!

W
Miles and miles of the weirdest cleavage you’ve ever laid your eyes on!

M
Ren Faire Boobs!

[ she plays the concertina ]

W
The prophecies tell us that one day the 4:45 mud show will return.

M
We know this to be true.

W
The prophecies were scrawled by the maker uponst a wooden board. It read “Mud Show at 1:30, 3 and 4:45”.

M
I saw the 1:30 and 3pm shows. Fine mud shows they were.

W
Yet we wait. We wait for the 4:45 mud show.

[ she plays the concertina ]

M
For at the 4:45 mud show we will be shown the way. The way through, to the other side.

W
One day a servant of the king cameth onto our lands and said he wished to appropriate it for a game.

M
A course! A course he said but not for a meal but a bit of jest!

W
A golf course they said to which we replied “WE WILL NOT RELENT! WE WILL NOT STEP ASIDE! WE ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE REN FAIRE AND WE MATTER!”

M
So we stayed. The course of the golf grew around us. The 1:30 Mud Show came and went. The golf course grew more. The 3pm Mud Show started and ended as well. The golf course grew more. It grew and grew until one day it stopped, leaving us here in the middlest of it.

W
Leaving us waiting for the 4:45 mud show.

M
It has been prophesie




W
I can tell the difference in the quality of your voice. You sound so dull and lifeless right now.

You’ll be much happier after it’s done, I’m sure of it. You’ll feel so much better.


TRON
A chase sequence where we’re on those bikes but it’s just like us standing there looking intense, one person in front, one in back, switch, both turn to side, switch, both turn to back, switch, both turn to side, both turn to front. There’s lots of looking over shoulders.

Light cues are in YELLOW.

Sound cues are in PURPLE, and followed by the number of the cue on the playlist.





[ LIGHTS UP. MUSIC (#1). JOEL AND CURTIS ENTER. ]

Joel and Curtis do some kind of brief intro.

[ LIGHTS OUT.]


[ LIGHTS UP. A V/O ANNOUNCEMENT (#2). ]

V/O:
Ladies and gentlemen! Put your hands together for The Beach Boys!

[ THE TWO BEACH BOYS ENTER. ]

BB1:
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

BB2:
Hope you're all having fun. You having fun?

[ Beat. ]

All right.

BB1:
My name is Eddie Vale. I performed on the bass guitar for Al Jardine's Original Beach Boys family.

BB2:
My name is Brad D'Fazio. People call me Brad D. I was on additional percussion -- xylophone, etc. -- for Mike Love's Beach Boys and Friends Reunion Tour.

BB1:
We are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
And we're glad to be here at the 2009 Nucksua County Auto Show. There's a lot of really exciting stuff going on all around us.

BB1:
Cars.

BB2:
That woman over there.

[ Beat. ]

Cars, mostly. You know what I'm talking about.

BB1:
And of course if you know and enjoy songs such as "Little Deuce Coupe" and "Fun, fun, fun" you understand that cars are a big part of The Beach Boys mythos.

BB2:
It's a very inspiring subject matter. Really there's a lot to pull from it.

BB1:
Of course, we were not involved in the writing of those songs.

BB2:
Nor were we part of the original recordings.

BB1:
Come to think of it, I don't think either of us performed those songs on our tours.

BB2:
That is pretty odd when you think about it.    

BB1:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB2:
I want to be very clear, we are not here to perform music.

BB1:
Yes, I think we should get that out of the way up front before there's any confusion. We understand if, in light of this, you may not want to stick around, you may want to go take a look at some of those new Hyundais...

BB2:
The ad in the paper might've been misleading.

BB1:
But, the truth is, neither of us is really that into music anymore.

BB2:
No, not at all. Not at all.

BB1:
After the conclusion of our respective tours of duty, so to speak, we got in touch with each other. Started booking ourselves at various events under the name "The Beach Boys".

BB2:
Figured we had every right to, and no one ever seemed to have a problem with it.

BB1:
Until they actually showed up for the shows, and there was a lot of screaming.

BB2:
Really stressful.

BB1:
Long story short --

BB2:
-- we have been banned from Joe's Crab Shack chain of restaurants.

BB1:
For three months.

BB2:
Longest three months of my life.

BB1:
Anyway.

BB2:
Anyway.

BB1:
We've kind of given up the music thing.

BB2:
That's right. Mostly we're just two friends who enjoy doing things together, now.

BB1:
That's right, so we thought we'd come to the auto show.

BB2:
I like cars.

BB1:
I got no problem with 'em.

BB2:
And we saw this little raised, stage-like area.

BB1:
The very one before you now.

BB2:
And I said, "Eddie?"

BB1:
And I said, "Yes, Brad D?"

BB2:
And I said, "Watch this." And I grabbed the microphone attached to the PA system, and I said, "Ladies and gentlemen, The Beach Boys!"

BB1:
And then we pretty much just jumped up on this stage and started talking.

BB2:
And that pretty much catches you all up to speed, right?

BB1:
There was no ad in the paper.

BB2:
No, that was just me riffing.

BB1:
Anyhow, since we're up here, we might as well talk about some things.

BB2:
Yeah, let you know what we've been up to.

BB1:
We're out of the music game, for one thing.

BB2:
Good riddance.

BB1:
I've been thinking about picking up some new hobbies.

BB2:
I already got cars to tide me over.

BB1:
I want to do the thing you do with the wood you find on the beach, you know?

BB2:
I like crafts.

BB1:
Yeah, things you can do with your hands.

BB2:
Very natural.

BB1:
I don't know what that's called though, so I'm having a hard time finding a book on it.

BB2:
If anyone knows what that's called, you pick up the microphone over there and just holler it out.

BB1:
I see some new people milling around at the edge of the crowd.

BB2:
So if you've just joined us, we're The Beach Boys --

BB1:
-- Eddie and Brad D --

BB2:
-- we don't perform music anymore --

BB1:
-- and we need to know the name of the thing where you take wood from the beach and make an art thing out of it.

BB2:
Uh ... does anyone have any questions?

BB1:
OK, it looks like you guys are kind of dispersing.

BB2:
Yeah, crowd's breaking up a little.

BB1:
Fair enough, fair enough.

BB2:
We really have no particular right to be up here in the first place.

BB1:
Yeah, we didn't have anything to say in particular.

BB2:
This thing we're doing up here has kind of run its course.

BB1:
Now I feel almost like I'm talking just to talk, like I'm locked in the groove.

BB2:
And I'm starting to see that there are some men in badges coming toward us.

BB1:
Probably security officers.

BB2:
Probably. And why not? They're just doing their jobs, we're obviously not a part of this show in any official way...

BB1:
It's pretty clear that we're breaking some rules right now.

BB2:
Not that the auto show necessarily has rules written down somewhere, but I think we can all agree that there's some unspoken rules...

BB1:
Like trash, for example. No rule you gotta put it in the can, but come on.

BB2:
And you don't see anyone else just climbing up on stage and running their mouths, so, I think, shame on us, ultimately.

BB1:
I think we just had an idea that we thought would be fun for us, but we didn't really consider whether it would be fun for other people.

BB2:
We didn't think of the consequences! Didn't think of the consequences.

BB1:
Now we'll probably be fined, in some way.

BB2:
Or sent home, more likely, without seeing as many of these exciting prototypes as I would've liked to.

BB1:
And we're still talking...

BB2:
We're still talking!

BB1:
Which goes to show, we still have a lot of growing up to do, the two of us, in terms of learning from our mistakes.

BB2:
But really, that's for us to figure out. We don't need to burden you by making this a public spectacle.

BB1:
Thankfully, it seems that almost all of you are just walking around now, not really paying attention.

BB2:
And it would appear that our security escort is waving us off the stage.

BB1:
So we'll go quietly.

BB2:
Once again, we are The Beach Boys.

BB1:
It's certainly been a pleasure.

BB2:
And, uh ... keep on surfing.

[ THEY EXIT. LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ LIGHTS UP. TWO GUYS SIT ON A COUCH: G1 and G2. ]

G1:
So, how are things lately, man?

G2:
My girlfriend is upset with me.

G1:
Sorry to hear that. What's the problem?

G2:
I don't know.

[ G2 makes jerk off motions. ]

G1:
Can you think of anything you could have done to upset her?

G2:
I don't know.

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Do you guys fight a lot?

G2:
Yes.

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
So it's safe to say it may have been something you did?

G2:
Who knows?

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
You make that gesture a lot.

G2:
What gesture?

G1:
Do you care about Jennifer?

G2:
You know.

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Let's try something. Tell me about your relationship with your father.

G2:
Oh. OK. We never got along that well, I mean, he was always...

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Interesting. Tell me about the first time a close friend or relative died.

G2:
Hmm. It was my uncle. Uncle Greg. I remember going to the funeral and...

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
So, you didn't care for Uncle Greg?

G2:
No, Uncle Greg was a great guy and... you know...

[ Jerks off. ]

G1:
Would you say you have trouble expressing your emotions?

G2:
No. I wouldn't say that.

G1:
I really care about you as a friend.

G2:
Thank you.

G1:
I mean you are one of the most important people in my life. I cherish our friendship.

G2:
Wow. That's very kind.

G1:
Do you have anything you would like to say to me?

G2:
You know...

[ Jerks off.]

G1:
Thanks, buddy.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ LIGHTS UP ON CURTIS. ]

Curtis does some kind of brief monologue.

[ CURTIS EXITS. LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ LIGHTS UP ON TODD AND ED. ]

TODD:
Ed?

ED:
Yes, Todd.

TODD:
Something's missing.

ED:
Something's missing?

TODD:
Lately, I've felt like something's missing.

ED:
Did you retrace your steps?

TODD:
Something's missing from our lives. I'm twenty-seven years old.

ED:
As am I.

TODD:
We're adults.

ED:
By any measure.

TODD:
But I don't feel like an adult. I feel like a child.

ED:
Because something's missing.

TODD:
Precisely.

[ Beat. ]

ED:
Kids?

TODD:
God, no.

ED:
Marriage?

TODD:
Jesus Christ, no. I'm not ready for that.

ED:
Taking your job seriously?

TODD:
My nine to five doesn't define me.

ED:
A clean house?

TODD:
I told you I'd get around to it this weekend.

[ Beat. ]

ED:
You've stumped me. What's missing?

TODD:
Cigars.

ED:
Cigars?

TODD:
It's time for us to get into cigars.

ED:
That's it?

TODD:
"That's it"?

[ Todd pulls a cigar from his pocket, removes the wrapping, puts it in his mouth. ]

Old-fashioned sophistication. Masculine grace. A powerful smell. Yes, Ed, "that's it."

[ He tries to bite off the end of the cigar and spit it out. He bites off a little too much, ends up with flakes of tobacco on his tongue. ]

ED:
You don't smoke.

TODD:
I don't smoke. I smoke cigars.

ED:
Same thing?

TODD:
It is not. Cigarettes are for teenagers in baggy jeans and fat old sallow women tugging at Atlantic City slot machines. Cigars are for men. Men of wit and position. Rich, robust, oaky men.

[ Todd holds up a series of pictures of the following men. ]

Men like Mark Twain! Sigmund Freud! Mr. Spacely from The Jetsons!

ED:
Kid Rock.

TODD:
I'm sure I don't know who you're talking about.

[ Todd pulls out a lighter and lights the cigar. He takes a puff. ]

Watch that smoke curl, Ed. It's a diaphanous road to a vanished world of men.

[ Another puff. ]

A world where corpulent power brokers bathe in coal-heated wooden barrels. Where weighty affairs of state are settled over a hand-drawn map and two glasses of brandy. Where the sexual health of even the fanciest prostitute cannot be guaranteed.

[ Another puff. ]

Memories of empire!

ED:
Where did you get it?

TODD:
Behind the counter at the gas station.

ED:
Shell?

TODD:
Valero.

[ Pause. ]

It's pretty good.

ED:
How do you know?

TODD:
It cost four dollars. The other ones cost two or less.

[ He looks at the cigar. ]

How much longer do you think it'll last? One minute? Two?

ED:
You've got twenty minutes at least.

TODD:
Time enough to be a man.

[ He takes a another puff. ]

Let me just put this down for a moment.

[ He puts it down. ]

Needn't hurry the pleasure, after all. A man does not gulp from life's cup. He sips.

ED:
Todd.

TODD:
Edward?

ED:
Can I put out your cigar and throw it away?

[ Todd looks tempted. ]

TODD:
No ... no, you can't.

ED:
It smells like a burning vat of pubic sweat.

TODD:
As a man with a cigar, and therefore authority, I order you not to extinguish my cigar, the source of my authority.

ED:
All right.

[ Todd grabs the cigar. ]

TODD:
Cigar!

[ He holds it aloft. ]

While I was at Valero, I also picked this up.

[ He pulls out an issue of GQ Magazine. ]

Gentleman's Quarterly. Not some weekly rag. Though I be not of the gentry, the clerk must have spied that within mine eyes and gait which bespoke of some nobility, and thus allowed me purchase of this journal.

[ He opens it up. ]

Herein is the very chart of the fashionable man about town, a man who catches your eye and steals your focus, a man with ... a cigar!

[ Ed takes the magazine, flips to some articles. ]

ED:
Gentlemen seem to love ultimate fighting.

TODD:
A gentleman is sporting.

ED:
And body spray.

TODD:
Yet he is not afraid to put on the teasing airs of a dandy!

[ Todd takes another puff of the cigar, looks a little ill. ]

ED:
Doesn't that thing taste like crap?

TODD:
Nay! No more than life itself.

ED:
Put it out.

TODD:
Never.

ED:
Just put it out. I know where this is going, and I don't want you hosting weekly poker nights and puking scotch into the bathtub.

TODD:
I shall do all these things and more! I have been a boy too long! In Africa, they hunt lions with spears. The natives of this land wrestle with bears to prove their mettle. This is my rite de passage. This is my walkabout! I will smoke this cigar, and then I will smoke another! And then I will stand with broad shoulders and stride this earth as a man.

[ Ed grabs the cigar, snuffs it, and tears it in two. Then he slaps Todd.

She's just showing her concern! She's a good parent!

I don't know where they put me. It's very dark in here.

[ Louder, with a sob. ]

 Nabisco!

[ LIGHTS DOWN after the weeping fades out. ]


[ LIGHTS UP on two dudes sitting on a couch (D1 and D2). ]

D1:
Do you smell that?

D2:
I smell something.

D1:
Do you smell what I'm smelling?

D2:
No, I smell what I'm smelling.

D1:
But it could be the same thing I'm smelling.

D2:
It could be.

D1:
There's really no way for us to know.

D2:
Do you think there could be two different smells in here?

D1:
At least. And we could be smelling any number of them together or separately.

[ Beat. ]

D2:
Let's use descriptive language to arrive at common ground.

D1:
About the smells?

D2:
Yes, the smells.

D1:
What I smell smells like a mustard fart trapped in an old rubber balloon.

D2:
I see. What I smell smells like thirty-six-hour-dead roadkill.

D1:
So they're different.

D2:
Not necessarily. One common inspiration might have produced two very different descriptions.

D1:
True.

D2:
As when one beautiful sunset inspires a whole legion of poets.

D1:
Each to a different flight of fancy.

D2:
Each to his own idiosyncratic rhapsody.

D1:
Or hers.

D2:
Pardon.

D1:
Well, then I think we can both agree -

D2:
-yes-

D1:
- that we are both -

D2:
- Uh-huh -

D1:
- smelling something bad.

D2:
Agreed.

[ Pause. ]

D1:
The question presents itself: What is to be done?

D2:
A proposal.

D1:
Yes?

D2:
We accept it and we move on.

D1:
Explain.

D2:
In life there are many smells. Some are good, some are bad. They come; they go. For the most part, they run their course without being identified. It's best just to move on. Especially when you rent.

D1:
That's unacceptable. You and I are human beings. We have independent thought and free will. We have science. I propose that we identify this smell and find a way to remove it.

D2:
We are two different people.

D1:
We are.

D2:
With different perspectives and temperaments.

D1:
Yes. Different backgrounds and experiences.

D2:
That too.

D1:  
Well. I have proposed a plan of action, and I wouldn't be much of a man if I didn't see it through.

D2:
Godspeed, my friend.

[ D1 exits and from off stage makes sniffing, gagging, and near-vomiting sounds. D2 remains seated and is inexpressive. D1 enters. ]

D2:
What happened?

D1:
I failed.

D2:
You did not fail. Your journey has just begun.

[ D1 sits next to D2 and lays his head down. D2 cradles D1's head. ]

D1:
I hate it. I hate it so much.

[ LIGHTS UP ON A DOCTOR AND A PATIENT. THE PATIENT IS SITTING ON AN EXAMINATION TABLE, THE DOCTOR SITTING ON A CHAIR IN FRONT OF HIM. ]

PATIENT:
So it's serious, doctor?

DOCTOR:
No, not yet. But we do need to take it seriously. It's my recommendation that we operate.

PATIENT.
Oh God. Oh God.

DOCTOR:
It's going to be all right, Mr. Watkins. The surgery is not especially dangerous. And I can say, without arrogance, that I'm the man to do it.

[ Beat. ]

This was my area of specialization in medical school. For this procedure, you will not find a more qualified surgeon in 1,000 miles.

PATIENT:
OK, OK.

[ Beat. ]

I'm sorry I kind of lost it there.

DOCTOR:
You're doing fine. Now, let's talk about scheduling, is that all right?

PATIENT:
Sure, sure. I'm ready.

DOCTOR:
As it happens, I'm not available for a couple of weeks, but we can operate just as soon as I am.

PATIENT:
Is that -- uh -- is that --

DOCTOR:
Mr. Watkins, as an expert, I assure you: There's no danger in waiting a couple of weeks.

PATIENT:
OK. But it'll just be two weeks, right?

DOCTOR:
Two weeks from today, I promise you.

PATIENT:
OK.

[ Bounds off the table. ]

OK. That sounds great, doc.

DOCTOR:
Excellent.

[ He begins paging through a file. Absent-mindedly. Makes notes with a pen. ]

Really, it's the best possible time. We'll get you in and out ... get Monday off from work, you know, and make sure you have someone to drive you there and back. The wife and I will be getting back from Burning Man that weekend, so I'll be refreshed...

[ He looks up at the patient, who has frozen. ]

Something wrong?

PATIENT:
Uh ... no.

[ Pause. Patient fidgets while doctor resumes writing. ]

You and your wife are going on vacation then?

DOCTOR:
We are! We're quite looking forward to it.

PATIENT:
To, uh ... Burning Man?

DOCTOR:
That's right.

[ Beat. ]

Something wrong?

PATIENT:
In the desert?

DOCTOR:
Well, let me check the brochure.

[ The doctor pulls a small brochure out of patient's file. ]

That's right, in Nevada. My brother-in-law says it's quite something.

[ Hands brochure to patient. ]

PATIENT:
Isn't this the um -- uh --

DOCTOR:
Yes?

PATIENT:
The -- uh -- sorry, the --

[ Beat. Extends arms. ]

-- uh, fire guy --

[ Beat. ]

-- the big drug thing?

[ Beat. Doctor chuckles. ]

DOCTOR:
Well, they say it's a week-long exercise in "radical self-expression," so use your imagination.

PATIENT:
Are you going to, uh -- well --

DOCTOR:
Try a few things?

[ Chuckles. ]

We'll see where it goes. We're mostly going to show off our art car, but what's the point unless you're open to all the wild possibilities?

PATIENT:
Uh -- oh, was that your car in the parking --

DOCTOR:
Yes, with the astroturf and --

PATIENT:
-- shards of mirror --

DOCTOR:
That's it. It started out as just a hobby. And then foom.

[ Makes explosion gesture. ]

It took over. I've come to consider myself a car artist first and foremost. Though medicine is still a fairly important part of my life.

PATIENT:
Right.

DOCTOR:
My second biggest priority, at least.

[ Beat. ]

I'm really looking forward to this trip. I want to feel a deep connection with people, the way I did before Phish stopped touring.

[ Beat. ]

Things got dark after that, man.

PATIENT:
Excuse me?

DOCTOR:
It was a very troubling period of my life, Mr. Watkins.

PATIENT:
You know, I should probably look at my calendar, but I think maybe we ought to do the surgery later that week.

DOCTOR:
Nonsense. I'll return from Burning Man on Sunday night and get in at least two or three hours of sleep. Then a hot cup of coffee, and then straight into the operating room with you, Mr. Watkins. With a free mind and clean hands.

PATIENT:
OK.

DOCTOR:
Hey, can I get your opinion on something? I've been thinking about creating a different atmosphere in these examination rooms. They've always felt a little cold and sterile to me.

[ He flips a switch. RED LIGHTS ON. WEIRD PSYCHEDELIC FOLK MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY (#6). ]

I think something like this could help patients connect with their primal essence. The part that can heal itself.

PATIENT:
Uh.

DOCTOR:
If you like this, you'll love the operating room. You can't imagine how extraordinary the endocrine system looks under black light. Of course, you won't be awake to see that--

PATIENT:
Uh.

DOCTOR:
Unless you'd like to be. There are many more natural alternatives to traditional anesthesia that you might want to consider. There's a wonderful root I've discovered behind my house. It's not only a very thrilling hallucinogen, but, in distilled form, a potent short-term paralytic. If you'd like one, though, you should probably tell me now, because I was planning on bringing them to Burning Man.

PATIENT:
Well, uh... I don't know.

DOCTOR:
Tell you what, try one on me, and if you like it, we'll talk.

[ He pulls a piece of root out from his cheek and offers it to patient. ]

PATIENT:
Um, doctor ... no aspersions to your expertise, of course, but I think I might want to get a second opinion. Just in case.

DOCTOR:
Perfectly reasonable, Mr. Watkins. I've given you a traditional medical approach, but there are exciting alternative possibilities you can explore. I know some healers who are doing very exciting things with whale powder and panda bear gum.

PATIENT:
Sure, I might look into that.

[ Extends his hand. Pause. ]

DOCTOR:
Ah yes, sorry. I forgot what hands do for a moment.

[ They shake. ]

Isn't it fantastic that we do have hands? We could easily be squid people, with tentacles. But I digress.

PATIENT:
Thanks, doctor.

[ He hustles out the door. ]

DOCTOR:
Make sure you talk to our receptionist about getting scheduled!

PATIENT:
Right.

[ HE EXITS. ]

DOCTOR:
I feel so safe here.

[ He looks at his hands. ]

Oh dear. I better stop my skin melting if I'm going to operate.

[ Beat. ]

Oh, there it goes.

[ LIGHTS UP. JOEL ENTERS dressed as Vincent Van Gogh. He carries a bottle of absinthe and a glass. He sits at a table, pours himself a glass. PARISIAN MUSIC PLAYS (#7). ]

CURTIS [V/O]:
Ladies and gentlemen. It's your show, Vincent Van Gogh!

VINCENT VAN GOGH:
Stars. Fuckin’ stars. They say there’s billions of ‘em. I didn’t count. Maybe, I don’t know. I care? No. Fuck it.

[ Beat. ]

Bright though, sometimes, you look at ‘em right and you’ve had just enough. Absinthe is best. Sweet lady absinthe. That’s where I live, baby. Twinkle, twinkle. Drink drink, gaze gaze, dab dab dab. They say the sun is a star. Fuck the sun. Never did anything for me but wake me up from a good night’s sleep. Makes my head pound. So, the sun’s a star; I say, fuck the stars. And fuck you. But I’ll paint ‘em. I’ll sure as fuckfire paint the shit out of those stars. Gimme a twinkle and I’ll paint you too, maybe. Who knows?

[ Beat. ]

So maybe all those other stars up there, they got planets whizzing around ‘em just like us, and maybe on one of those planets there’s another me, drinking a third glass of absinthe in some piece of shit bar and answering fuckin’ questions posed by blank-faced dumbfucks like you.

[ Silence. ]

Christ, I gotta take a crap.

[ VAN GOGH EXITS stage for a good thirty seconds, then ENTERS again. ]

False alarm.

[ Pours himself another glass. ]

It does it to you like that, sometimes. Ties your goddam guts up in so many knots you don’t know what’s comin’ or goin’. Works the other way, too, sometimes. Sittin’ on an afternoon train to Paris, you know, not knowin’ that people are ditching the dining car ‘cuz you just laid a big fuckin’ crap on the floor. Well, leave me the car, sonsabitches. That’s the way I like it. Leave me in fuckin’ peace and quiet to eat my fuckin’ pudding.

[ Pause. ]

Pudding. Good banana pudding has no rival in my fuckin’ mind, man. Nothing in the world. You can take your flan and you can put it, I say, right up your ass. Sweeter than milk from mama’s tit, pudding is. Let’s have some of that tasty shit.

[ Van Gogh takes a pudding cup and small wooden spoon from his jacket pocket, opens it up, pours a small amount of absinthe into the cup, starts eating. ]

Motherfucking yum.

[ Beat. ]

Talent? Who says talent? That ain’t what it’s about kids--not now and never will be. Bustin’ balls, that’s me. Bustin’ my fuckin’ nuts every morning, noon, and night, paint under my nails, rubbing my fuckin’ knuckles raw, smellin’ the oils ‘till I think they must be killing my brain. That’s me. You think I was squawling in my crib with a goddam brush in my hand? Takes work, motherfucker. Talent is what fuckin’ amateurs spend all day bitchin’ at themselves for not having.

[ Beat. ]

That’s why I’m me and you’re you.

[ Beat. ]

Gaugin, he understood that much. Not much else. Slick motherfucker, he was. Moustache, and always with the hats. And me saying to him, again with the hat? Again with the hat? And him giving me the same old bullshit about fuckin’ headcolds. And look at me, bald as a babe, out there taking my evening constitutional, unhatted, every night in the middle of fuckin’ winter and do you see me sneezing? You see me let out a cough or a piece of snot danglin’ from my nose? No, you don’t.

[ Beat. ]

Gaugin, though, he liked his hats. What makes a man a man? Who the hell knows. Maybe he needed it or some shit like that. Maybe you take the hat off Guagin and he don’t paint worth a shit. Fuckin’ . . . like the guy in the Bible. Big brawly bastard gets a haircut and now he’s a pussy. It’s in there, look it up. Never much of a theologian myself. Bullshit, I say. The shit about the magic hair and shit like that. I like a good psalm, though. A little poetry, some language, you know, some rhetoric--something that’ll put a real tingle in your sack.

[ Beat. ]

So Gaugin’s in his hat, see. We’re out at a cafe. Same old, same old. I haven’t slept in like three days. I’m on a roll, see, nailin’ hookers and painting like I’m in my prime. Four self-portraits in forty-eight hours, two landscapes in twenty-four. All pretty good. Some not the best, but, you know, you don’t strike gold every fuckin’ time. But you keep digging. And this was good shit.

[ Beat. ]

Killing hookers, too, see? You gotta. Fuck I’m gonna pay a woman for sex and let her go around knowin’ that shit? Blabbin’ it all over town about that freaky one-ear fuck and his bizarre bedroom behavior? Not a chance. Not in hell, kiddos. So I’m paintin’, and I’m killin’ hookers. And for each hooker that I strangle and dump in the river, the muse pays a visit to my bedside, and I’m paintin’ like a fiend. Ain’t no one got nothing on my shit. Not Rubens in his day, you hear me?

[ Silence. Van Gogh laughs. ]

You believe that shit? Come on, fella. Lighten the fuck up. Bullshit. Van Gogh is clean, baby.

Hello everyone and welcome to Austin Sketchfest! We are so excited to do this show for you. We've worked really hard, writing all day long!

JOEL
Tonight we are premiering our new show "Sufjan Stevens"!

CURTIS
We spent a lot of the last year listening to Sufjan's words and music, his tremolos and resting tones, and we were so inspired, so inspired were we that we wrote a full length play to accompany his album "Illinoise".

JOEL
It's touching, it's groundbreaking, it has nudity and audience interaction, it's unlike anything you've ever seen. At some point, Courtney gets into a City of Austin trashcan and does a very touching dance.

So chic. Hey guys, by the way, I used the condom that came in my Moontower gift bag. It worked! I'm totally pregnant!

EVERYONE
Yay!

[ Sound FX: shock collar ]

EVERYONE
Ow! Ouch! Ow!

COURTNEY [pulling a note out of her mouth ]
What....guys, it's a message to us: "Do the sketch comedies like we asked or you will get shocked, love, Austin Sketch Fest".

CURTIS
What kind of bullshit is this?!

JOEL
We will do our Sufjan Stevens play or...

[ Sound FX: shock collar ]

ALL
Ow! Ow! Ow!

COURTNEY [ pulling out a note ]
Start with Ladyshades. We like that one.

[ COURTNEY and CURTIS are two street hustlers are at a table. They’re selling bootleg and knockoff merchandise. ]

HUSTLER #1
We got watches! You need watches? We got ‘em! Genuine Rolex watches!

HUSTLER #2
Bags! Prada bags for your lady! Gucci bags for your special lady! Maybe you are a special lady? Get a bag!

HUSTLER #1
We got real computers! Dell computers, we’ve got Apples. Genuine article, real computers for computing. Download songs, use the calendar, install programs. Computers!

HUSTLER #2
Snacks? We got Raisinets! We got Mounds! We got bags of Bugles, big bags of genuine Bugles! The snack you love, the snack you’re familiar with!

[ Detective Ladyshades enters. He is a tough cop who always wears women’s sunglasses. He walks across the stage. ]

HUSTLER #1
We got sunglasses, legitimate sunglasses that are real! Oakleys, your Ralph Lauren! Real sunglasses to keep sun out of your eyes!

HUSTLER #2
Sunglasses, sir! Men’s sunglasses! Latest styles.

[ Ladyshades turns slowly. ]

LADYSHADES [ pointing at his face ]
Already got a pair.

HUSTLER #1
Yeah, but...

[ The hustlers start giggling. Ladyshades is cool as a cucumber. ]

LADYSHADES
Got something to say?

HUSTLER #2
Just thought you might like a pair of men’s sunglasses.

HUSTLER #1
Instead of those lady shades.

[ Ladyshades moves like a panther, grabs hustler by the shirt. ]

LADYSHADES
That’s Detective Ladyshades to you, punk. Detective Mike Ladyshades. You got a permit to sell this knockoff garbage?

HUSTLER #2
Buh-buh-buh-buh...

LADYSHADES
That’s what I thought. Beat it.

[ The two hustlers scurry off, nervously. Ladyshades lights a cigarette. ]

LADYSHADES
I just like the way they feel on my face better. That’s all.

[ MUSIC CUE with VOICEOVER. ]

V/O
Detective Mike Ladyshades will return in Ladyshades II: Cop Looks Like a Lady … Tonight!

[ Ladyshades sees the two hustlers scurrying around. ]

LADYSHADES
Hey, I said “beat it!”

[ He starts chasing them around. The chase becomes more rodent-like, until they all get shocked. ]

ALL
Business … business … that’s right, back to business …

[ They transform into characters for Business Meeting. Barry is seated scribbling on a note pad. There is a plate of cheese cubes. Carl is looking out a window in search of inspiration. Debbie is holding a cell phone and a file. They are all wearing control collars around their necks. The three begin to scratch at themselves and other rodent-like actions until they are shocked. ]

[ Sound FX: shock collar ]

CARL
I’m looking out the window remembering the less complicated times of the past.

BARRY
Yeah, yeah, oh yes sir, Carl.

DEBBIE [ hands a file to BARRY. ]
Here’s the Johnson account and the Harding files.

[ Ring bell. The three eat a piece of cheese. ]

CARL
Do you, Barry, remember the less complicated times of the past?

DEBBIE [ looking at planner ]
Remember, the three o’clock meeting was moved to three-thirty.

BARRY
I do. Yes sir I do.

CARL
Barry?

BARRY
Carl.

CARL
I’ve been reminiscing about the past and reviewing the numbers.

DEBBIE
But the meeting is with the three of us, and since we’re all here we may as well have the meeting now.

BARRY
And?

CARL
We need more of them.

BARRY
More numbers? Great idea, sir.

CARL
And our profits--

BARRY
Profits? Yes sir.

CARL
--they need...well, we need to have them.

BARRY
Actual profits, sir?

CARL
Debbie, what do you think of more actual real profits?

[ BARRY gnaws on his fingertips and moves to Debbie to size her up. Sound FX: shock collar. They all get shocked. ]

DEBBIE
If we want to make a profit won’t we have to actually do something? Make something? Sell something?

[ Ring bell. The three eat a piece of cheese. ]

BARRY [ as he opens a file and shredded newspaper falls out ]
I see. Making profits requires us to provide some kind of product or  service.

CARL
We can always fudge the numbers a bit.

DEBBIE
Carl, that’s illegal.

CARL
It wouldn’t be the first time.

DEBBIE
You can’t be serious.

BARRY
He’s quite serious, Debbie.

CARL
Do you think we became the top number one company in our field through hard work and moral business ethics?

DEBBIE
Of course.

BARRY
Yes?

CARL
Well we tried. We just suck at being good.

BARRY
That’s true.

DEBBIE
So we just give up? Just like that?

BARRY
Yeah, just like that?

CARL
We haven’t given up. We’ve just become a little lax when it comes to certain policies.

BARRY
OK, a little lax is all.

DEBBIE
And what exactly does that mean, Carl?

BARRY
Yeah, Carl.

CARL
It means we’ve turned bad in hopes of doing good at what we used to do badly being good.

[ CARL moves to the window and gazes out of it again. ]

BARRY
Oh, I get it.

DEBBIE
No you don’t.

[ DEBBIE and BARRY size each other up again. Sound FX: shock collar. The three are electrocuted. ]

CARL
Like I said, I’m remembering the less complicated times of the past.

[ Ring bell. The three eat a piece of cheese. ]

DEBBIE
This is insane.

BARRY
Watch yourself, Debbie.

DEBBIE
Shut up.

CARL
You shut up, Debbie. No one likes you!

BARRY
Yeah, stupid!

DEBBIE [ to Carl ]
You bastard!

CARL
Oh this struggle for the top has turned me into a monster!

BARRY
It really has, sir. Yes.

DEBBIE
How many have you hurt, Carl? How many people have you told to shut up? How many good days have you ruined?

BARRY
You’re asking a lot of questions, Debbie.

DEBBIE
You knew when I started that I was a go getter with a thirst for the truth.

CARL
Let this one go, Debbie.

DEBBIE
What are you afraid of, Carl?

CARL
Maybe you should find something to do, Debbie.

BARRY
Why don’t you file some papers like a good Debbie.

DEBBIE
You mean like this paper?

[ DEBBIE produces a sheet of paper. ]

BARRY
Yes, file that paper.

CARL
How did you get that paper, Debbie?

DEBBIE
I’ll file this paper.

BARRY
Good!

CARL
Where did you get that, Debbie?

DEBBIE
I’ll file it right now...to the police.

BARRY
Quit talking about filing it and file it, DEBBIE!

CARL
You. Giant. Bitch.

DEBBIE
This paper proves that this conspiracy of number fudging and shut up telling goes right to the top. I think the commissioner will like to see this, huh?

CARL [ holds out a bullet ]
How about you show him this bullet? After I shoot it into you!

[ They all begin yelling and threatening each other. They get mouse-y, then stand upright. Sound FX: shock collar. The three are electrocuted. While being electrocuted, Courtney and Joel move to downstage center, don lab coats, face the audience and hold a shoe box. ]

MALE SCIENTIST
Man, all these mice do is vaguely mimic business structures.

FEMALE SCIENTIST
Then it just dissolves into a stereotypical corporation conspiracy movie ending.

MALE SCIENTIST
Another failure for science.

CARL
How can you consider this a failure!? We evolved into bipeds! We understand abstráct concepts! We look like you now! We can talk! We use words like bipeds and abstráct!

FEMALE SCIENTIST
What do you want to do with them?

MALE SCIENTIST
I’ma gonna flush ‘em down the toilet.

[ Scientists do business of flushing rats down the toilet. ]

[ Sound FX: toilet flush. ]

[ Curtis changes into CHIEF and enters to find two scientists in his office. He rolls up a magazine, sneaks up behind them as if he’s hunting a roach, and whacks them in the backs of the head. The scientists run. ]

CHIEF
Get outta here you filthy scientists! Teach my kids how things work on the subatomic level?! I don’t think so!

[ Ladyshades enters and sits across from the CHIEF during the rant. ]

CHIEF
Ugh. Now, you. You know what I don’t like about you, Ladyshades? You got ghosts. Ghosts, you hear me? Lots of good men in this department have lost friends over the years, but they haven’t got a whole army of spooks trailing them down the streets. Your ghosts are making you crazy, and this is a police department, not a haunted house.

[ The chief sits. ]

CHIEF
You hear me? You hear what I’m saying to you?

[ Ladyshades stands up. ]

LADYSHADES
Loud and clear.

[ He starts to leave. Gets his hand on the doorknob. ]

CHIEF
Oh, and Ladyshades?

[ Ladyshades pauses. ]

CHIEF
Take those ridiculous girl’s sunglasses off your face.

[ Pause. ]

LADYSHADES
You and this department can go fuck yourselves, chief.

[ He leaves. ]

LADYSHADES
Maybe they’re made of lighter material or something. I just really like the way they feel.

[ MUSIC CUE with VOICEOVER. ]

V/O
Detective Mike Ladyshades will return in Ladyshades III: A Lady’s View to a Murder and a Half … The Revenge!

LADYSHADES
Time for the part of this job I hate the most: undercover work.

[ Begins to remove sunglasses, strokes them for a moment. ]

LADYSHADES
See you on the other side, sweetheart.

[ Removes them. ]

LADYSHADES
Oh god! The sun … so bright!!

[ Continues to freak out as he becomes “Randy” and removes his clothes. Randy nervously sits in a chair. He calls offstage to a prostitute. Randy begins undressing. ]

RANDY:
My name’s Randy. What’s your name?

[ He takes off his shirt. He is wearing an undershirt. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Doesn’t matter.

RANDY:
I’ve never done anything like this before.

PROSTITUTE:
That’s sweet.

[ He takes off his shoes. ]

RANDY:
I kept telling myself to wait for the right time, and it just never happened.

PROSTITUTE:
This is your first time?

RANDY:
I’ve done other things. A lot of other things. I’ve done everything except vaginal intercourse. I’ve been with a lot of women but something always comes up when...you know.

[ He takes off his pants. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Like what?

RANDY:
Like....war. Sometimes there’s...a fire. One time...there was, like a problem with some-body's dog, I think. Like a bad problem. Like, it was a...bad...problem.

PROSTITUTE:
That sounds bad.

RANDY:
Yeah.

PROSTITUTE:
We need to make this special for you.

[ He takes off his socks. ]

RANDY:
Are you almost ready?

PROSTITUTE:
Just about, Randy.

[ He puts his socks back on. ]

RANDY:
Don’t take too long.

PROSTITUTE:
All ready. You ready, Randy?

RANDY:
I’m ready.

[ PROSTITUTE ENTERS carrying two ducks. ]

RANDY:
What are those for?

PROSTITUTE:
I’ve got something special in mind for you.

[ RANDY laughs nervously. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Now you just sit back, relax, and close your eyes, Randy.

[ RANDY relaxes and closes his eyes. PROSTITUTE rubs the ducks’ beaks seductively against RANDY’s mouth, etc. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Ooo, Randy, you just keep your eyes closed and think about all the nasty, filthy things you’ve ever dreamed of.

RANDY: [ giggles ]
Wow, OK.

PROSTITUTE:
We’re at Baja Fresh, Randy. And you can’t help yourself. You take me to the bathroom, and your high school nurses are waiting for us. They’ve got their bras on, Randy.

RANDY:
Great!

PROSTITUTE:
Oooh, Randy, you’ve got me in a stall. The nurses want to take your temperature because you’re sick. Oooo, Randy, I can feel your knee caps are getting so hard. You’ve got the hardest knee caps.

RANDY:
Yeah, I do.

PROSTITUTE:
You’re so bad. I should spank your butt, Randy. Spank it like a bad hamster. Your hamster butt is puckering. It wants to be kissed. I’ll kiss your butt so hard.

RANDY:
Uh, sure.

PROSTITUTE:
Randy, all your aunts are coming to visit. They want to know why you won’t visit them. My choo-choo is excited for fun. It’s getting hard, like your knee caps.

RANDY:
I want to go to Baja Fresh.

PROSTITUTE:
You want to go?

RANDY:
Now!

PROSTITUTE:
You’re ready?

RANDY:
God, yes.

[ PROSTITUTE throws ducks at RANDY hitting him in the face. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What?

PROSTITUTE:
Randy.

RANDY:
Yes?

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What are you --

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What are you do --

PROSTITUTE:
Ooo, Randy, you had your orgasm.

RANDY:
No I di-

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

RANDY:
What are you doing?

PROSTITUTE:
You need more orgasm?

RANDY:
I--

[ BEAT ]

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck!

[ She extends her hand in expectation of payment. Randy shrugs. ]

PROSTITUTE:
You were so good, Randy. Fifteen hundred.

RANDY:
Dollars?

PROSTITUTE:
You didn’t like it, Randy?

RANDY:
No!

PROSTITUTE:
What do you want?

RANDY:
I thought we could start with some heavy pet--

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck! Eighteen hundred.

RANDY:
You really expect me to pay you eighteen hundred dollars?

PROSTITUTE:
Uh-huh.

RANDY:
But this isn’t what I want.

PROSTITUTE:
It’s non-consensual, Randy. That makes it soooo much hotter.

[ She laughs. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Everyone loves the double duck, Randy.

RANDY:
Not me.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck! How about now?

RANDY:
No.

PROSTITUTE:
Two thousand one hundred.

RANDY:
I’m not paying.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck! Twenty-four hundred.

RANDY:
STOP IT!

[ LESTER THE PIMP ENTERS. ]

LESTER:
What’s goin’ on in here?

RANDY:
Who is this?

PROSTITUTE:
Randy here got double ducked.

LESTER:
You’re a lucky man, Randy. She’s the best double ducker in the city.

PROSTITUTE:
He’s refusing to paying, Lester.

LESTER:
Randy.

RANDY:
What?

LESTER:
You’re not going to pay?

RANDY:
No.

LESTER:
And why not?

RANDY:
I didn’t like it.

LESTER:
Everyone loves the double duck Randy.

RANDY:
Not me.

LESTER:
Give him one on the house.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Now give him one on me.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Give him one on you.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Give him one so I can watch.

[ She throws them again. ]

PROSTITUTE:
Double duck.

LESTER:
Now, give yourself one so we can watch.

[ She double ducks herself. ]

LESTER:
That was nice. All right Randy, here’s what’s gonna happen.

[ LESTER pulls out a butter knife. ]

You’re gonna pay the lady...

[ BEAT ]

...or I’m gonna.... cutthisduck.

PROSTITUTE:
No Lester don’t do it.

LESTER:
Shut it. He pays or I cut the duck.

RANDY:
I’m not going to pay.

[ LESTER stabs the duck. ]

LESTER:
Now you owe her some sex money and me a new duck.

RANDY:
Look, I don’t want any trouble from some pimp, but I don’t have that kind of money.

LESTER:
I ain’t no pimp. Just on my mail route, thought I’d drop in and say hello.

[ As he’s leaving. ]

LESTER:
Randy. I want that duck.

[ LESTER EXITS whistling. ]

RANDY:
That was pretty weir--

[ Throws the duck again. ]

COURTNEY:
Double duck.

RANDY
I can’t take it anymore!

[ RANDY puts on lady’s sunglasses and becomes Ladyshades. He speaks to the audience. Courtney freezes. ]

LADYSHADES
It is my lady; O, it is my love! O that she knew she were! She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?

COURTNEY
You’re mysterious and sexy now.

RANDY
Let’s go out into the night and get a Denny’s meat skillet in us.

[ LADYSHADES and WOMAN sit across from each other. WAITER enters and walks quickly past the couple as he speaks. He doesn’t stop ]

WAITER
Detective Ladyshades. Prostitute. Welcome to Denny’s.

LADYSHADES
Thanks.

WAITER
Oh and happy anniversary.

WOMAN
I know it hasn’t been easy, Ladyshades.

[ Beat. ]

WOMAN
A man like you has seen a lot, I guess. And maybe when you’ve seen so much … maybe trust just … goes away.

[ Beat. She reaches across the table, takes his hand. ]

WOMAN
Thing is, Ladyshades, I’ve seen some stuff too. You see a lot when you grow up on the streets as the world’s deadliest female assassin slash prostitute. And maybe I had a time when I didn’t trust anyone, either. But you have to trust, sooner or later, or what does it mean? All the bullets? The blood? The people you’ve seduced and slash or murdered -- what the fuck is it all for, huh?

[ Beat. Ladyshades slides an envelope across the table. ]

LADYSHADES
Happy one-month anniversary.

[ She smiles, picks up the envelope. ]

LADYSHADES
Best month of my life.

[ She opens it. ]

WOMAN
A Pier One gift card!

LADYSHADES
They’ve got a lot of shit in there that I think would look nice at your place.

WOMAN
I got you something, too.

[ She slides a box across the table. He opens it, slowly, pulls out a very masculine pair of aviator shades. Pause. ]

LADYSHADES
I should have known better than to trust a woman.

[ He throws the glasses down, storms downstage as she protests. ]

LADYSHADES
I’ll admit it; I also like the styling better.

[ MUSIC CUE with VOICEOVER. ]

V/O
Detective Mike Ladyshades will return in Ladyshades IV: Come Back To The Five and Dime, Detective Mike Ladyshades, Detective Mike Ladyshades … Don’t They?? The Quickening!

LADYSHADES
Now I’m leaving.

[ He exits. Iced Tea Harry enters, sits downstage at a table with a large pitcher of iced tea. He has a glass, which he fills up, drinks from. When he finishes, he pours himself another glass. He wears a straw hat. He has a fan and fans himself continually. He uses a rag to pat his sweaty brow. ]

[ Another man and a woman ENTER upstage, standing side by side. They deliver their dialogue in rapid fire, never pausing. ]

MAN
Who’s that?

WOMAN
That’s Harry.

MAN
Harry, huh?

WOMAN
Iced Tea Harry.

MAN
Iced Tea Harry?

WOMAN
That’s what they call him.

MAN
What’s he call himself?

WOMAN
Nothin’.

MAN
Nothin’ at all.

WOMAN
He’s been comin’ here for twenty years, every day, at that table, just drinkin’ his iced tea, and never sayin’ a word.

MAN
Not a word?

WOMAN
Never a peep.

MAN
Just drinkin’ that tea?

WOMAN
Dawn till dusk.

MAN
Never no water?

WOMAN
Nary a sip.

MAN
Nor nothin’ to eat?

WOMAN
Nothin’ but tea.

MAN
He use the necessary?

WOMAN
That what?

MAN
The restroom.

WOMAN
Many times.

MAN
He sad?

WOMAN
Maybe.

MAN
He lose a lover?

WOMAN
Maybe a child.

MAN
Poor man.

WOMAN
Sittin’ there, sippin’ tea, trying to stay cool in this hot, hot world.

MAN
Iced Tea Harry.

WOMAN
Now you’ve got it.

MAN
I’m gonna talk to him.

WOMAN
You ain’t neither.

MAN
I am.

WOMAN
You ain’t.

MAN
I gotta know.

WOMAN
You ain’t gotta know nothin’.

MAN
I gotta know what it is gives a man a thirst like that.

WOMAN
Every man’s got his own thirst. Every thirst’s got its own reason. You can’t reckon thirst like weighing a sack of onions.

MAN
He got a throat, ain’t he, to pour that tea down? He got a tongue to lick his lips, don’t he? He got lips to get licked by his tongue, don’t he? Then he can answer me one question.

WOMAN
A man’s mind is his own, like his pitcher’s his own.

MAN
I’m gointa ask.

WOMAN
Don’t.

MAN
Gointa.

WOMAN
Don’t. Don’t.

[ Man makes quick shuffle-steps downstage toward Harry. Woman stays frozen in place. ]

WOMAN
Don’t. Don’t.

MAN
Harry.

HARRY [ doesn’t look up ]
Yup.

MAN
Your name’s Harry.

HARRY
Yup.

MAN
You ain’t know me.

HARRY
Nope.

MAN
I’m just a man. Just a man.

HARRY
As am I.

MAN
But I have a question.

HARRY
Each man’s got a right to his questions.

MAN
Yes.

HARRY
Other man’s got a right to the answers, though.

MAN
Yes.

[ Pause. ]

HARRY
Well?

MAN
Why you drink so much iced tea, Harry?

[ Pause. ]

HARRY
Tea.

MAN
You been drinking it long as I been here, and I been here a long time.

HARRY
Tea?

MAN
Why you drink it all day, Harry? All day long?

HARRY
I don’t like iced tea.

MAN
Pardon?

HARRY
Don’t care for it.

MAN You don’t?

HARRY
Wouldn’t never drink it.

MAN
This is iced tea, Harry.

HARRY
Never liked iced tea.

MAN
You been drinking it this whole time.

HARRY
Gross!

[ Harry takes a big swig of iced tea. ]

MAN
It’s still iced tea, Harry.

[ Harry spits in Man’s face. He immediately pours another glass and takes a big swig. ]

MAN
Why, Harry?

[ Harry spits in Man’s face. He immediately pours another glass and takes a big swig. ]

HARRY
Ugh, gross!

MAN
Why are you doing this to yourself?

HARRY
Doing what?

MAN
Drinking this iced--

HARRY
What is it!

MAN
No! Harry, no!

[ He immediately pours another glass and takes a big swig and spits it in the man’s face. ]

HARRY
I don’t like it!

[ Harry picks up his coat and hat and storms out. He takes a swig of tea ]

MAN
The soul of man is a great mystery.

WOMAN
Ain’t no way of reaching the bottom.

MAN
Never in a hundred years.

WOMAN
Even with the eyes of the angels.

[ Man picks up the pitcher, sniffs it, retches. ]

MAN
Something ain’t right with this tea.

[ They exit and leave one chair in the center left portion of the stage. ]

[ MUSIC. ]

[ Everything after this happens just upstage of the chair. HARRY enters as if he's just walked out of the restaurant's mime door in a huff but then he puts on his coat and hat and is immediately in a good mood. He starts walking the Red Balloon walk. He passes a tree (Joel) reaches his car (brought on by Courtney, who stays with the car the whole time). He drives, encounters a man (Joel, dressed in the kingpin's jacket and hat) who he hits and doesn't stop. He then stops gets out of his car, steals the man he just killed's jacket and hat, discards his hat and jacket, and walks on, Courtney makes it so that car disappearing as he walks. Joel strikes the old hat and jacket and sneaks off with the car. Courtney enters selling newspapers, looking forward but moving sideways. HARRY stops and buys a cardboard newspaper with cardboard money but they just shake them at each other like they're shaking hands and then drop them. HARRY continues, Courtney exits moving sideways, looking forward. HARRY goes through a mime door, Joel enters as LADYSHADES with his hands behind his back like he's tied to the chair already, moving sideways but facing forward. He sits in the chair. As HARRY reaches him, he is now the KINGPIN. KINGPIN spits iced tea in LADYSHADES’ face. KINGPIN paces back and forth in front of LADYSHADES in the chair. ]

[ MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

KINGPIN
You know something funny about me, Ladyshades? I love cops.

[ Beat. ] 
they keep amateurs out of the game. Clear out the little fish so the big fish have room to swim.

[ Beat. The kingpin kneels in front of Ladyshades. ]

Most cops are too dumb to catch a big fish, Ladyshades. But if a cop gets smart, my business has a problem. And I can’t let that happen.

[ He pulls out a knife. ]

Buenas noches, Mr. Ladyshades.

[ The woman bursts in. ]

WOMAN
Ramon, no! I’ll come back to you if you let him go!

KINGPIN
Lo siento, mi amor. The cop has gotta go.

[ She grabs him from behind. They struggle. He knocks her back to the ground. ]

KINGPIN
You watch now. I want you to see him die.

[ He pulls out a pair of sunglasses. ]

KINGPIN
I’m gonna do one thing for you, though, Ladyshades.

[ He reaches for Ladyshades’s face. ]

LADYSHADES [ quiet, measured ]
Don’t touch the sunglasses.

KINGPIN
Come on, Ladyshades. You want to die like a pretty little girl ...

[ He takes them off, drops them on the ground. ]

KINGPIN Or you want to die like a man?

[ He leans forward to put the men’s sunglasses on. Ladyshades bursts from his restraints, enraged. He grabs the knife and stabs the kingpin. ]

LADYSHADES [ to woman ]
Sorry you had to see that.

[ He bends over and picks up his sunglasses. ]

LADYSHADES
Good thing he didn’t scratch them. I would’ve gotten mad.

WOMAN Oh, Ladyshades.

[ He comes downstage. She hangs off him. ]

LADYSHADES
I know it’s just in my head, but when I wear these, I feel like I see the world from a feminine perspective, approaching problems in a more intuitive way. And that improves my detective work! Also, it helps me keep my apartment clean!

[ MUSIC CUE with VOICEOVER. ]

V/O
Detective Mike Ladyshades will return in Ladyshades V: Ladyshades, Ladyshades, Ladyshades in Breaking Training!

LADYSHADES
I want to take you somewhere special.

WOMAN
Yes?

LADYSHADES
The place where the next sketch is happening, coincidentally.

WOMAN
The circus?

LADYSHADES
Bingo.

[ They walk in a little circle. ]

WOMAN
Let’s go sit in our circus seats!

[ They exit. ]

[ SOUND CUE. ]

[ A lion tamer enters. He carries a chair and a stick. He is taming a lion, invisible to the audience. He approaches the stage through the audience. ]

LION TAMER [ Eastern European accent ]
Alyona! Mishka! Hep-hep!

[ turns ]

Galechka! Oksana! Pip-pip-pip! Pip-pip-pip!

[ turns outward ]

Khoroshi khloptsi!

[ Applauds, bows to the audience. By this time, he is onstage. ]

Pip-pip-pip! Hep-hep! Oksana! Mishka!

[ He turns suddenly. ]

Ni, Alyona, ni! Zhump! ZHUMP!

[ A terrible howl. The lion tamer turns, and begins to scream, he holds up his hands in defense. ]

Mishkaaaaaaaa!

[ He freezes in place. ]

VOICEOVER
I have tamed many things in my life. Beasts. Women. The irresponsible spending habits of my youth. Yes, I have tamed many things. But now life has tamed me at last.

Hmmm. My speech is very odd. In death, it seems, I am no longer Ukrainian. It seems that in death is no country, no homeland. In death, there is only destination.

But I cannot be dead yet. No, not yet, for I still feel the excruciating pain of Mishka’s powerful jaws closed around my face. Yes, every tooth is a red hot ember of searing agony.

Ah, Mishka. Timid little broken Mishka. I should have known what mighty resentment slept within your shrinking frame. It is not the proud and strong who lash out with fury, but the frightened and desperate. Oh Mishka, Mishka, you were so easy to break, so simple to tame. But now you have broken me. You have broken my skull. I feel its juices already leaking. Oh, Mishka, the names I called you. Fat, lazy Mishka. Dull, charmless Mishka. Could your cat ears sense the notes of contempt in my voice? I misjudged you, Mishka. The jungle spirit was still in you. I could not drive it away.

It seems I am still not dead. I feel myself being tossed this way and that. I feel razor-sharp claws flaying the skin from my back. Now he is just showing off. It is fitting. Have your moment in the spotlight, Mishka.

Ah, but perhaps this is death? Perhaps this is what happens when you die? Your consciousness frozen in that last moment before death, trapped forever in the time before it is extinguished?

That would be such a ripoff.

This is stupid, really. This whole thing has been stupid. Lion taming is stupid. Why tame a lion? The circus, Jesus -- is this really a relevant form of entertainment in the 21st century? TV is very good these days, especially cable. Shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad deliver gripping, thoughtful entertainment on a regular basis. And the availability of shows on DVD and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu mean that even those without a regular cable subscription have access to and can enjoy these shows.

How can a circus compete with this? It’s barely holding on. Anyone can crunch the numbers and see. Ticket sales are down; insurance premiums are way up. The animal rights people are on our ass everywhere we go. And who can blame them? We treat these animals very, very poorly! This no kind of life for a wild animal. It’s no life for a human being. Spending half your day with clowns. And not birthday party clowns, people who actually went to a clown school and talk about “the art of clowning.” One stinking town after another. Bad food, dirty sheets. Christ, kill me now. I mean--you know what I mean.

I could have gotten out. Used my savings to take a class on Photoshop and Flash. Those are skills for the twenty-first century! Social media--I had ideas about social media! The circus had five more years in it, tops. I could have lived, lived life as a interactive graphic designer!

Did I just urinate on myself? Yes. In front of these people. My final act. My closing statement, as it were. Ugh, the lycra in my unitard is kind of trapping it in, keeping it in my crotch. My balls are kind of sloshing around in it. Wet and warm. Terrific. At least it distracts from the feeling of Mishka tearing my ligaments apart.

Ugh. I never finished my bucket list. Never finished writing my bucket list, even! I wonder if that movie was good. Probably not.

Wait, what’s that? Music. Music! A heavenly choir? Dare I believe it? That the superstitious tales of my childhood faith are real? That in death, we are welcomed into the next world with the singing of angels?

This sounds familiar, actually.

Is that Boyz II Men? OK. Those guys were pretty good, weren’t they?

And Mariah Carey! I’ve got no problem with her.

Yes! I am ready. Ready for the next life!

Soon I shall soar over the earth, seeing everyone and everything! The design of the entire cosmos! All is one and all is beautiful at rest! I shall see the beginning and the end, all time compressed to a single moment! The mystery revealed!

And I know you’re shining down on me from heaven,
Like so many friends we’ve lost along the way,
And I know eventually we’ll be together
Together
One sweet daaaaaay-aaaay

…

Um. OK? I’m ready now, for--you know--whatever it is. Kind of tired sitting here as this fucking lion chews on my throat.

…

Hello?

…

Come on. Come on!

…

Wait, something’s coming!

…

Aw, it’s a void! A void of eternal darkness and silence! Goddamit! Ripoooooooooofffffffffffffffffffff!

[ Tamer’s body is carried offstage. ]

V/O
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: let’s have a big hand for the Amazing Pietrov, a man who literally died doing what his job was! And now, let’s welcome our next performer of the night: mysterious internet singing sensation Gladys St. Taco!!

[ Pause. ]

Gladys St. Taco!!!

[ Pause. ]

Gladys St.--

GLADYS [ offstage ]
Shut up.

[ She enters. ]

[ MUSIC CUE: Backing music. ]

[ Gladys sings song, then sits down with host. Marcos enters and sits too. ]

HOST
Well, that was just magical. Just magical.

GLADYS
Thank you.

MARCOS
Yeah, thanks.

GLADYS
This is my soulmate, Marcos.

MARCOS
Sup.

HOST
Let’s talk about your album “You Can’t Fucking Control Me”.

MARCOS
OK.

GLADYS
Sure.

HOST
… OK, so, the album’s really been the talk of the internet.

GLADYS
I guess so.

MARCOS
We’re broke up.

GLADYS
What?

MARCOS
Now we’re together.

GLADYS
Come here.

[ They hold their heads close, stick their tongues out, almost touching. ]

HOST
How has fame changed your life?

GLADYS
Nothing. We still go to Sonic on Tuesdays.

HOST
So you’re trying to keep your life normal?

GLADYS
We go there to have sex in the trash can. Then Marcos takes photos of the staff.

MARCOS
Their outfits. Their faces. That’s the kind of stuff I like to photograph, real stuff. Overturned shopping carts. A crushed turd in the grass. Boobs, big boobs. I’m going to have a showing.

GLADYS
OK.

HOST
Your name, Gladys Saint Taco, is very interesting. Tell me how you came to chose that name?

GLADYS
My friends and I spent a lot of time hanging around Del Taco when we were younger and people would give us tacos when they came out of the drive-thru sometimes. Gladys was the name of an old woman I watched die when I was doing community service at a nursing home. Saint is from a saint I like.

HOST
Tell me about how you got started in music.

GLADYS
My mom bought me a piano when I was six months old. We lived in a hostel in Brooklyn. I had gigs in bars on the Lower East Side, in gay clubs. They loved me. Then my mom lost her job as the girl who swings over the piano at a piano bar. So we had to move to English country estate in England so she could be a maid and this butler taught me how to play “Word Up” by Cameo on the piano. Then the duke died so we had to move to LA so mom could be a personal assistant for Tim Burton. I went to high school in an old porn studio, the one where they shot “Sperms of Enrearment” and “Lonesome Dove: The Pornography”. Then I was on Days of Our Lives for 10 years. I took a Meisner class.

HOST
You were on Days of Our Lives?! The soap?

GLADYS
Whatever, I hated it.

HOST
Okay. So it’s safe to say you didn’t have a normal childhood.

MARCOS
We killed him.

HOST
Who?

MARCOS
Gladys is my sister and my lover.

HOST
Jesus!

MARCOS
Soul sister.

HOST
Are you actually related?

GLADYS [ accusingly ]
Are you?

MARCOS
We killed that guy from Cameo.

HOST
You killed Larry Blackmon?

MARCOS
Who?

HOST
The guy from Cameo. Can someone confirm whether Larry Blackmon is actually dead?

GLADYS
We killed you.

HOST
Who would you count as your influences?

GLADYS
Cameo. Boxcar Willie. Ke$ha.

HOST
People speculate a lot about whether you’ve had breast augmentation surgery. How does that make you feel?

GLADYS
I hate it. It makes me want to die. I want to crawl under someone’s porch and die and rot and no one will find me until the family that lives there starts wondering what smells under the porch, thinking it’s a dead possum or something. But it will be me.

HOST
So you haven’t had any surgery?

GLADYS
No. They’re balloons.

HOST
So, you’ve not had surgery but your breasts aren’t real.

GLADYS
I have a weird dad.

MARCOS
I have a webcam show where I review prostitutes that I see.

GLADYS
I hate his stupid show, and I hate him.

MARCOS
We want you to watch us watch prostitutes do it.

GLADYS
Interviews are so vapid. I hate myself. I’m retarded.

HOST
So, your hit single, Falling Pieces.

GLADYS
Yeah, I wrote that after Marcos and I divorced the second time.

HOST
It’s really touching. Let me just read some of the lyrics:
“Turn and float and turn and float
A knot is forming in my throat”
Wait, is this...is this song just about Tetris?

MARCOS
Let’s get married again.

GLADYS
Okay.

HOST
“Sweating palms
clear focused eyes
fumble with the buttons
You'll run out of tries”
This is a song about Tetris

[gradually over the course of the rest of the lines it becomes obvious that the characters are having troubles remaining "in character"]

MARCOS
No.

[ Sound FX: shock collar. ]

GLADYS
No.

[ Sound FX: shock collar. ]

HOST
“Fumble with the buttons?”

GLADYS
The buttons on a shirt. We’re trying to get undressed to have sex.

HOST
“The pieces
Fall from the sky
Try to make them fit
Before they stack up too high”
This is definitely a song about Tetris. [ To offstage staff ] Can we find out if this is a song about Tetris?

GLADYS
No, it’s about forever love.

HOST
Wait, the full title is “Falling Pieces” and then in parenthesis “This is a Song about Tetris".

GLADYS
No, it’s about forever love.

MARCOS
I don’t want to marry you anymore.

GLADYS
It's about forever love.

[ Sound FX: loooong shock collar. ]

MARCOS
I don't want to marry you anymore.

HOST
It's a song about Tetris.

GLADYS
Forever love.

MARCOS
I don't wanna.

HOST
It's Tetris.

GLADYS
Forever.

MARCOS
Marry you.

HOST
Tetris song.

[ FADE OUT sound. ]

HOST [ to the sky ]
What do you want from us?

MARCOS
We did all the sketches you asked. Please! Let us do our Sufjan Stevens play!

COURTNEY [pulling a paper out of her mouth]
It says we can!!

[ MUSIC CUE: “Chicago” by Sufjan Stevens. ]

[ Courtney does a dance under a trash can. Joel has a sketch pad with words and phrases in large font. He flips through the pages. Curtis approaches downstage. ]

CURTIS
It is the year 20--

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

CURTIS

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change with MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ There is a sign: “CASUAL CHILDBIRTH COOPERATIVE: Sit back, relax, and bring a new life into this world”. Two dudes, ART and SANDY, are sitting at a table. Art is playing Trivial Pursuit by himself ... he has a stack of cards; he pulls a card, looks at the question, looks at the answer, either smiles or frowns, repeats. Sandy is filling out a coloring book using a black sharpie.

An extended moment of silence as they do these things. ]

SANDY
I think it’d be pretty nice if we had some crayons.

ART
For the babies?

SANDY
For anyone.

[ Pause. ]

SANDY
Allison had her baby last Friday.

ART
Niiice.

SANDY
Yeah. At the hospital. I tried to convince her to do it here. No dice.

[ Art shrugs. ]

SANDY
It was crazy. I mean there she is, having a baby and there are these people everywhere. And they're carrying folders, and answering telephones and, you know, some of them seem to be in a real hurry and things can just get really ... brusque.

ART
That's ...

[ He shrugs. ]

SANDY
That's right.

ART
I mean, that's why we ...

[ He sort of twirls his fingers in the air. ]

SANDY
I know. That's what I thought.

[ ANGELA, a very relaxed and very pregnant lady, comes through the door, sipping hot tea from a paper cup. ]

ANGELA
What's up, guys?

ART
Not much, lady.

SANDY
What's up ... ... with you?

ANGELA
You know.

[ She sits down in an extremely casual posture. Pause. ]

ANGELA
So, what's up?

ART
Already asked.

[ Pause. ]

ANGELA
I know.

SANDY
We were just talking. About how we started this whole deal, and why.

ANGELA
Oh yeah?

[ She flips over in her seat, comfortably grabs and moves her pregnant belly to the side. ]

ART
We were talking because our friend Allison had a baby, but we couldn't convince her to go this route.

[ Twirls his fingers. ]

ANGELA
Her loss, man.

SANDY
A lot of women aren't prepared to consider the route of casual childbirth.

ART
Imagine her little baby ... first thing that baby sees in this world ...

SANDY
This crazy hospital where people are hurrying, and stressing, and all that junk.

ANGELA
Thumbs ... down.

[ She makes the thumbs-down, hops nimbly off her chair. ]

I'm feeling a little tight. You guys mind if I rock a few poses?

ART
Nuh-uh.

[ She does a series of yoga poses through the subsequent dialog, unimpeded by her pregnancy. ]

SANDY
So you thinkin' about having that baby today? Maybe tomorrow?

ANGELA
No hurry. Whenever.

ART
Baby'll come out when the baby's ready.

ANGELA
Or he can hang out in here as long as he wants. N ... B ... D.

ART and SANDY
Yup.

ART
You know, sometimes I don't even want people to think of this as a casual childbirth cooperative. I just want them to think of it as a really cool place to hang out.

ANGELA
That's how I think of it, guys.

SANDY
Thank you, Angela.

ART
It's just a place where everyone's cool, and it happens to also be a totally low-pressure, casual childbirthing environment.

SANDY
With zero stress.

ART
Like, if you're there and you think maybe you’re pregnant -- well, we’re here to help you have a baby.

SANDY
Maybe you’re not pregnant though. Maybe you just want to hang out.

ART
Yeah, that’s fine too.

SANDY
Maybe you just want to get to know some people, bang around a little, have some fun.

ART
Right. Maybe you like to party a little. Whatever.

SANDY
Maybe it’s “been a while”, so to speak, and you’re looking to get back on the scene, have some fun, a couple drinks, I don’t know, see what happens. It’s no big deal.

[ Angela breaks from her pose. ]

ANGELA
I'm not going out with you, Sandy.

SANDY
You shouldn't have to!

ANGELA
I know, I know -- but, for real.

ART
Hey Angela, I may just be hearing things, but I think maybe I just heard your water break.

ANGELA
What?

SANDY
You should check.

[ Angela pulls the waistband of her skirt open a little, glances down. ]

ANGELA
Whoa, there it goes.

ART
Looks like you're having this baby.

ANGELA
Looks like it. OK, you guys, well I better get to it, then.

SANDY
Take your time. Take your time.

ART
You'll just give us a call if you need anything?

ANGELA
Will do, will do. I'm just gonna go draw me a bath.

SANDY
You ... ... do that.

[ She nimbly waddles out the door. ]

SANDY
Having a baby, man. It’s amazing.

ART
Sure is.

SANDY
You just swallow up some sperm. Suddenly, you’ve got this awesome bulge, and it makes you walk all funny. Sometimes you get this urge to eat dirt and stuff. And the emotions just run wild.

ART
Amazing.

SANDY
Ten months later, a baby swims out of your butt.

ART
It’s the miracle of life, man.

SANDY
I know.

ART
But it ain’t nothing to get all worked up about.

SANDY
A-men.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A man sits on a bar stool. He is drunk. He has been drinking most of the day. The drunk smokes a cigarette and holds a glass of whiskey. ]

DRUNK
Hey. Buddy. What's that? What is that, your tenth, eleventh? I'm not judging. Look at me. I've been right here drinking. Same as you. What's the problem, huh? I've got mine. He's got his. Everyone here's got at least one. What's yours? Wife left you? Kids hate you? Laid off? Fired? What? I'm so sorry. Me? The wife left me, kids hate me, I was laid off. Fucking Dumbo.

You know, cartoon elephant flies around. Dumbo. That movie fucked me up. Oh sure, you think it's funny I have such strong feelings towards a kids animated movie. It messed with my head. Little fucker, so close to losing his mother because of his freakishly large ears. I never let my mother leave my sight after I saw it. It really did a number on me. Try showering with your mother when your twenty years old because you're afraid the circus is going to lock her away if you can't see her. Fucking Dumbo.

You're right, it's stupid of me to blame an animated movie for my problems. The Absent Minded Professor, now that fucked me right in the head. Not the movie as much as my experience with the movie. My dad made me watch it when he found out I got a D in chemistry. He told me it was the greatest tale of man achieving his dreams, and the best movie based on a true story. It was devastating when I found out flubber didn't actually exist. I never trusted my father after that. He lied constantly. When he died, I sat next to his grave for two days thinking that at any moment he would pop out of the ground. "Fooled ya, son. You're so gullible, like your mother." Fucking prick.

Of course, of course it's not Disney's fault my father was a pathological liar. But Disney did make Pete's Dragon and is therefore responsible for.... Now, I have no problem with Pete's Dragon. It didn't mess with my head like Dumbo. It wasn't the subject of one of my father's lies. This movie screwed up my childhood because Charlie Miller liked it. I was bullied at school by Charlie Miller. He was the biggest kid in class, and he hated me. However, after watching Pete's Dragon, he took quite a shine to me. Charlie invited me to play with him after school, and when we met up he told me that I was going to be his pet dragon. I immediately ran, of course, but he was so fast -- and strong.

[ The drunk takes a quick shot of his drink. ]

He stripped me nude, painted me green, and rode me around town while I growled and flicked matches at people. This occurred very frequently. I thought Charlie would eventually get bored with the idea but the people loved it. It was like some kind of fucked up parade.

Fucking movies, man. Fucking Dumbo. I'm sorry, buddy. I've been talking your ear off. Let me buy you a drink you can tell me about -- oh, look at the time. I gotta run pal. There's a midnight showing of Fantasia, and this dick ain't gonna masturbate itself. Well ... no, probably not.

Nope.

Oh yeah.

WOMAN:
And what’s your question?

Was that your question, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

MAN:
Thanks, Chuck.

[ Chuck enters. ]

CALLER:
I finally made it, y’all. This is so great.

MAN:
Margaret, you remember Chuck? From the phone calls.

WOMAN:
OK.

CALLER:
I got another question.

WOMAN:
Great.

CALLER:
If you happened upon a Surge can would you use it for one of your angels?

WOMAN:
Yes, I suppose I would.

CALLER:
What if I told you I had a Surge can? Would you use that specific one?

WOMAN:
Sure.

CALLER:
If I had a Surge can and gave it to you would you use it?

WOMAN:
Yes I would. I think that would be kind of fun.

MAN:
That would be fun. Chuck, give her that Surge can.

WOMAN:
I can make you a special Chuck angel.

MAN:
Do you have a Surge can, Chuck?

CALLER:
Yes.

WOMAN:
Do you have it with you?

CALLER:
Yes. [ Pause ] No. Can I see that coke can angel?

WOMAN:
Oh yes.

[ She hands Chuck the Angel. ]

CALLER:
This isn’t really my kind of thing. When you guys were telling me bout it I got really excited. I had so many questions I couldn’t think straight. Now that I see it, no thank you.

[ There is the MAYOR, wearing a sash that says "MAYOR" and holding a gavel. He stands behind a table. Off to the side, a seated BUSINESSMAN smokes a fat cigar and wears a jacket. They are frozen. ]

[ AUDIO CUE ... V/O which transitions into sentimental music. ]

V/O
You're watching Lifetime Original Movies. We now return to My Baby Ain't No Venue: The Tamara Rockwell Story.

MAYOR
Well, first of all, as mayor of this here town, I'd like to formally express my gratitude to you, Mr. Moneyberg.

[ Mayor claps. Businessman nods. ]

Without your tireless efforts and generous financial assistance, it's doubtful that the members of Hoobastank would have agreed to perform at our centennial festival. And though I am myself not a fan of their music, nor are you, members of council, nor you yourself Mr. Moneyberg...

BUSINESSMAN
It's just not for me. Not for me.

MAYOR
... it does my heart well to know that the young people of our humble community will have something to be excited about as they gather together to celebrate our history.

[ He claps again. ]

Now, to practical matters. As we all know, there has been a some trouble securing a performance space in the town that will meet Hoobastank's particular needs as a professional touring rock and roll band. Fortunately, the council has arrived at a solution. Our laws do allow for eminent domain in cases where the good of the community is at stake.

[ Beat. ]

Therefore, let it be known that the city of Fort Paxtown hereby seizes upon eight-month-old Toby Rockwell and formally recognizes him as a live performance space. Hoobastank's performance for the town centennial will take place--

TAMARA [ from offstage ]
You cain't do this! I ain't gonna let you do it!

[ Tamara enters, wearing white-trashy clothes and holding a swaddled baby. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

MAYOR [ banging gavel ]
Order! I will have order in here! Miss Rockwell, you have not been recognized.

TAMARA
I ain't expect to be recognized by no city council full of old men who ain't know nothing about what it means to give birth to a child and love that child with all your earthly might.

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, the council appreciates your concerns and regrets the necessity of its decision, but your son--

TAMARA
No! My baby ain't no live performance venue, you understand me? My baby ain't no venue!

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell--

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara, quit making a scene!

TAMARA
I see how it is. You lost the right to tell me what to do when you ran out while I was big with your child. You could've stayed. You could've been a father to this boy, and maybe I'd even have learnt to love you. But I guess your own flesh and blood don't mean as much to you as your damn stock price. And you ain't gettin' him back now, not like this.

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara, it's done. You can stop fighting. Hoobastank will perform on that boy.

TAMARA
No, they ain't! Not today, not tomorrow, not ever! I don't care what your damn law says. Your law was writ by old, stupid men for old, stupid men. Ain't no law on earth gonna tear me away from my child. Look at him!

[ She shows the swaddled baby to the businessman, who looks away. ]

So sweet, so pure. Like a little angel. How you gonna take this little miracle and stuff him full of thousands of screaming yahoos?

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara...

TAMARA
How you gonna back up three touring buses and a truck full of instruments and lights and a full stage set into a darling as darling as my little Toby?

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell!

TAMARA
How you gonna put a merch table and a full bar inside this beautiful child?

BUSINESSMAN
Tamara!

TAMARA
How you gonna let there be a party backstage inside this baby! My baby! Your baby!

[ Bangs gavel furiously, keeps banging it for uncomfortably long. Finally stops. Beat. ]

MAYOR
Miss Rockwell, your concerns have been noted. But I remind you, once again and for the last time, that there is nothing within the laws of the town --

[ Holds up a book with the laws of the town, starts flipping through it. ]

MAYOR
-- to prevent us from declaring your child to be a live performance venue oh wait here it is.

[ Bangs gavel. ]

MAYOR
Toby Rockwell is hereby restored to his mother's care, the town centennial is canceled, and you will just have to try and get your deposit back from Hoobastank, Mr. Moneyberg.

My Baby Ain't No Venue: The Tamara Rockwell Story has found resolution early. We now present seventeen minutes of test pattern. You are watching the Lifetime Movie Network.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change with MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Executive sitting at his desk with a file folder. He looks up. ]

I know what you think: mister boss-man, mister mega-bummer, mister three-meals-a-day, mister Jonny paycheck, mister business, mister yes-sir-no-sir-what-do-you-know-sir, mister vice president of business partnerships. That’s me, no doubt. I keep it tight. But guess what, junior? I can still rock hard on a weekday!

[ GUITAR RIFF. ]

What’s that? You’re telling me mister punch-the-clock-promptly-every-day-at-eight-a.m. was out of doors getting his balls rocked solid to some double-heavy in-the-pocket rock and roll last night, a Tuesday night? Till one in the morning? And after that, he had an hour’s worth of car-finding, home-driving, and body-showering to go before his head even hit the pillow? And here he is, making calls, running meetings, sending fucking emails like woooooooooo? Damn right, and I look good doing it.

So I was at the show last night, alone. I don’t need no buffer -- cramps my style. I’m there for the music. Real piece of shit club. No. Big. Deal. Bathroom’s out of order. No. Big. Deal. They didn’t make me VP of Biz-Part because I don’t know how to hold it. Anyhow, the band’s playin’. Local boys, I don’t know ‘em. They’re laying out some thick Blue Cheer shit. I’m halfway to heaven on the highway to hell.

I’m between two ladies -- two chicks, even -- with sleeve tattoos. Did I know them? I did not. These chicks are thirty, maximum. I still got the moves. So I fetch them a couple of drinks. “Nothing for me?” No thanks, ladies, I’ve got work in the morning. They were impressed -- they didn’t have to say it, I could tell. There I am, an exotic komodo dragon -- a successful upper-manager who still rocks hard on a weekday.

Did I seal the deal?

[ He holds up the folder. ]

You mean the lead-sharing arrangement with Fluxcorp? Because hell yes, and did it before lunch, even though I was rocking like a god-damn shaman last night. As for those ladies … gentlemen don’t tell, and neither do I. So let’s just say that I had sex with one of them and leave it at that. In the bathroom, by the way -- that part wasn’t out of order.

[ He howls like a wolf. GUITAR RIFF. ]

Now, if you’ll excuse me for a minute, I’ve got to get back to this executive summary. I’ve got a lot of shit to do before the weekend. And the weekend, man. Man. Just don’t even ask. You ain’t ready to know.

[ HEAVY ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC PLAYS AND CONTINUES PLAYING THROUGH THE NEXT SET CHANGE. He returns to perusing the file. He immediately face-plants into his desk. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Two office drones, sitting and typing facing forward at the edge of the stage. The first one reaches a stopping point. She leaps out of her chair and begins doing some basic stretches. She goes on as the other one keeps typing. ]

ONE:
It's a productivity system. I work for thirty minutes straight, and then I stretch for thirty seconds to keep my body awake.

It's a proven fact that frequent short breaks maintain the mind's ability to focus. Our ancestors didn't evolve in offices, after all. They evolved on great, stretching plains. The Serengeti. They honed their instincts while hunting for tigers and the majestic water buffalo.

[ She reaches into a bag and pulls out a sweatband, which she puts on her head. ]

I'm really getting in the groove, I think.

Another thing that's important at work is minimizing distractions. Our digital age presents a lot of distractions. For example, e-mail. How many minutes a day do you suppose are wasted by people checking their inboxes? OK, take that number, and double it. Then triple it. Now it's a big number. You see? So I have one email alert that goes off three times a day. Anything I can respond to in less than one minute, I respond to it immediately. The others I flag for a more detailed response later in the day. So, for example, observe, like this: respond, flag, respond, flag, respond, respond, interesting, do I need it, no, delete, spam, spam, spam, interesting, but ... archive, to a labeled folder "email from mom," straight to my heart.

[ She gets out of the chair and goes into a downward-facing dog pose. ]

Blood rushes to the head, frees the mind, and you're ready for some more work, yoga-style.

[ She does a few more simple poses, breathes deep ostentatiously. ]

You can't think of it like office work, you know. You have to think of it as battle. Because that's what our bodies evolved for. Battle. We are physical creatures. We are warriors. As a woman, my body is calibrated for three things: battle, child-rearing, and organization. But you have to be the peaceful warrior. Stillness in motion. It's judo. It's leverage. You use the force of the work against itself.

[ She stands up, gets in a judo pose. ]

So the work comes at me, and I just --

[ Judo moves. ]

And then --

[ Judo moves. ]

So, suddenly, it's five a clock, and I'm not even tired. Because I just made the work do itself. With mind judo. People work too hard, you know? You have to value your weekends. You know how many people die from stress-related heart problems, all because of a little stupid work? It's ridiculous.

You know what else is ridiculous? Chicago-style pizza. I mean, I like it OK. I like eating it. But the idea that it's really some kind of style, that's ridiculous. It's some kind of bread bowl. It's not a concept for a pizza.

That was just some small talk. You can't talk about work all the time.

TWO
Janice, can you take it easy? I'm really trying to play Farmville. It's a game on the internet where I run an imaginary farm. I just got a pig. I need to build a fence for the pig.

[ Their eyes meet. Long pause. ]

TWO
Janice, it's all I have.

[ Long pause. ]

ONE
Maybe I'll take lunch.

[ She starts to leave. ]

ONE
If anyone needs me, I'm eating a cup o' noodles on the elliptical. [yelling back to him ] This is the best first day ever!

[ SHE EXITS. He looks at the monitor. ]

TWO
There you go, you little porker.

[ He sniffs sadly. ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ There are props on a table at the back of the stage. Dan sits at a desk. Lilly, his secretary, prepares for the interview. ]

DAN:
Lilly?

LILLY:
Yes, Dan.

DAN:
Lilly?

LILLY:
Here, Dan.

DAN:
Lilly!

LILLY:
Yeah, Dan.

[ BEAT ]

DAN:
Umm. Please send in the next interviewee.

LILLY:
Now, Dan?

DAN:
Nnnnnnnnnnnnnow.

[ Lilly gestures to the door and James immediately enters. ]

DAN:
Well, hello there. You must be James.

JAMES:
I am.

[ Dan crosses to James and they shake hands. The hand shake lasts very long. Lilly is clearing Dan's desk ]

DAN:
I’m Dan.

JAMES:
Hey there, Dan.

DAN:
I’m just pleased to meet you, James.

JAMES:
It’s a pleasure to be so enthusiastically met.

[ They throw their heads back and laugh and stop laughing simultaneously. They are still shaking hands. ]

DAN:
I’ve been looking forward to this day since I first read your resume.

[ Romantic music plays. The hand shake turns into an embrace. Lilly brings out a picnic blanket, a basket, flowers and a candle and sets it all up on the floor. DAN and JAMES sit.]

JAMES:
I’m so very glad you liked it.

DAN:
I couldn’t put it down. It made for a nice bedtime story.

JAMES:
I’m rewriting the ending. Maybe make it a happy one.

DAN:
It says you like the out doors?

JAMES:
I hike, Dan. I hike.

DAN:
Do you bike ride?

JAMES:
I do, Dan. I do.

[ Dan breaks the embrace and turns away from James. They get up. Lilly clears the picnic. ]

DAN:
It also says that you have been with your current employer for twelve years, James.

[ James approaches Dan. ]

How can I compete with twelve years of loyalty, James.

JAMES:
I wouldn’t be --

[ Dan, startled, turns to James. ]

DAN:
I didn’t know you were that close.

JAMES:
Oh, sweet Dan. Easily startled Dan. I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t looking for a way out. After twelve years I’m looking for something new. Something different.

DAN:
One thing and one thing only prevents me from interfering with your employer.

JAMES:
What is it, Dan?

DAN:
Honor. It prevents me from offering you a position while you are employed by someone else. It’s honor.

[ Dan lowers his head. ]

JAMES:
You want me to end things with Coat Tech?

[ Dan slowly rises his head. ]

DAN:
And if I said yes?

JAMES:
I would do it.

[ Lilly sets Dan's desk back up complete with phone. Dan picks up the receiver, turns the base toward James to dial, and hands him the receiver. ]

DAN:
Then do it.

JAMES:
Right now, Dan? On this phone?

DAN [ leans in and whispers ]
Do you see any other fucking phones?

JAMES [ also whispers ]
No, Dan. I don’t.

DAN [ whispering ]
Then dial the fucking number and make the fribbin’ call.

JAMES [ whispering ]
Did you just say “fribbin’?”

DAN [ whispering continues ]
I don’t think I did.

JAMES
You said, “make the fribbin’ call.”

DAN
Does that really matter now?

[ James dials the number and puts the receiver to his ear. ]

JAMES [ Immediately. ]
I quit!

[ James slams down the receiver and pushes the phone away. ]

DAN:
I see, James. But how can I be sure you won’t leave me in twelve years.

JAMES:
Trust, Dan. Trust me and I’ll trust you.

DAN:
Your resume says you are creative. Please expand on that.

JAMES:
I paint, Dan. I paint, I draw, I write. I have a fire in my gut, Dan. It burns so hot and so hard, and the only way to keep from burning alive and then exploding like a dying star is to paint, draw, and write.

DAN:
You artistic types are always so dramatic. I love it.

JAMES:
I love you.

DAN:
Take me away from all of this, James.

JAMES:
In a second Dan. In a moment’s second I would take you away. We’ll drive out of this city in my new...company car?

[ Dan nods his head. ]

We’ll drive out of this city in my new company car.

[ Lilly moves two chairs and (something else) to the front of the stage to simulate the front seats of a car. He sits in the driver’s seat of an incredibly small car. He pats the passenger seat. ]

DAN:
Sit in my car, James.

JAMES:
In this tiny car, Dan?

DAN:
Sit in the flibbin’ car, James.

JAMES:
Yes sir.

[ James sits on the passenger side. Dan begins driving. ]

DAN:
Where are we going, James?

JAMES:
It doesn’t matter.

[ Lilly enters with a map and a GPS ]

JAMES:
We don’t need a map. We don’t need a GPS.

[ Lilly turns on her heel and exits with the map and the GPS ]

JAMES AND DAN:
Our hearts will be our guide.

JAMES:
Dan?

DAN:
JAMES.

JAMES:
Dan, I’m having second thoughts man.

DAN:
It’s too late for second thoughts James! We are in the shit! There is no going back.

[ Dan howls. ]

JAMES:
I have a wife and kids back home, Dan.

DAN [ shocked. ]
That wasn’t on your resume, James.

JAMES:
I didn’t think--

DAN:
You fucking lied to me, James.

[ Dan floors the accelerator. Lilly runs by with signs to indicate they are going fast (?) ]

JAMES:
Dan you’re going way too fast!

DAN:
You lied to me James. How long before you left me, huh?

JAMES:
Dan this all happened so fast.

DAN:
It wasn’t going to be twelve fucking years was it?

JAMES:
You’re scaring me, Dan. You need to slow down.

[ Dan begins driving erratically. ]

You’re going to kill us.

DAN:
I’m already dead, James. I died the moment we met.

JAMES:
What?!

DAN:
Fuck you, James.

[ We hear the sound of police sirens. ]

JAMES:
Thank god, the cops. Pull over.

[ Police officer Lilly enters, moves a chair behind James and Dan and begins driving. ]

DAN:
Shit, man. I’ve got a kilo of coke in the trunk, man.

JAMES:
Ah shit, man.

DAN:
Yeah, man.

JAMES:
Ah shit, man.

DAN:
Yeah, man. They ain’t takin’ me alive, man.

[ Reaches to his hip and draws a hand shaped as a gun. ]

JAMES:
Oh fuck, Dan.

DAN:
You with me, Jimmy?

JAMES:
I-I-I-I-I just--

DAN:
You gotta make up your mind here and now, man.

[ James regains his composure. ]

JAMES:
I’m with you, Dan.

DAN:
There’s a pantomime gun under the seat.

[ James reaches under the seat and pulls out his hand shaped like a gun. ]

Alright James! You finally grew a pair.

[ Dan swerves the car and stops. He opens the door and starts to get out. The cop is quicker and shoots Dan with her finger gun. ]

JAMES:
Oh my god! Dan! Dan!

DAN [ dying ]:
James, I never learned to ride a bike.

JAMES:
I’ll teach you how.

DAN:
What will people say, James? Two grown men, one who can’t ride a bike because he never learned, and one teaching him while wearing jean shorts and baby oil.

JAMES:
I don’t care what they say.

DAN:
JAMES - I’m dead.

[ James slowly puts his finger gun in his mouth and shoots himself in the head. He dies. ]

[ BEAT. ]

[ DAN and James both hop to their feet. ]

DAN:
James.

JAMES:
Yeah, Dan.

DAN:
Welcome aboard.

JAMES:
Thank you sir.

DAN:
Lilly, please show James to his office.

LILLY:
Yes sir. I’m Lilly.

JAMES:
Hey there, Lilly. I’m James, and I think I’m going to like working here.

[ They all laugh. ]

[ COURTNEY is onstage drinking from a teacup and reading the paper ]

COURTNEY:
Mmmmmm, delicious Dr. Pepper.

CURTIS: [ from offstage ]

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ She collects her stuff and rushes around trying to tidy up.  She answers the door. ]

COURTNEY:
Curtis!

CURTIS:
Courtney!

[ CURTIS is carrying a teacup and a newspaper. They sit and read and drink. ]

CURTIS:
Mmmmmm, delicious Dr. Pepper.

COURTNEY:

It's Joel!!

Joel:
Hey guys! Dr. Pepper time!

[ Joel produces his own paper and teacup. They all sit down and read and drink. ]

CURTIS:
____________ is such a ding dong!

[ Their heads all snap up. ]

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

JOEL:
Who is it?

CURTIS:
There's no one there.

COURTNEY:
That's strange. I heard the door bell. I swear I heard "ding dong!"

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
Who is it.

JOEL:
There's no one there.

COURTNEY:
That's strange.

[ They close the door.]

JOEL:
What's going on? Is someone ringing the doorbell and running off?

CURTIS:
I don't know. It's really weird.

COURTNEY:
Guys, I think I know what's going on. Everytime someone says "ding dong"....

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
This is so weird!

[ They close the door ]

JOEL:
What were you saying, Courtney?

COURTNEY:
Every time one of us says.....the "D" word, someone rings the door bell.

CURTIS:
That makes so much sense!

JOEL:
Are you saying we can summon stuff, we can make things happen just by making noises?

COURTNEY:
Yes.

CURTIS:
Wow.

JOEL:
BOOM!

[ They all panic, running around screaming "Get Down!" "Take Cover!" They eventually calm down. ]

CURTIS:
Joel! Don’t do that!

JOEL:
Sorry. I just got excited.

COURTNEY:
Booooo, Joel.

[ They all freak out running around yelling that there’s a ghost. ]

JOEL:
Maybe that’s who’s been ringing the doorbell!

CURTIS:
A ghost?

COURTNEY:
That makes so much sense!

CURTIS:
No, Courtney, it really doesn’t. And here’s what I think of your ghost theory.

[ Makes fart sound with his mouth ]

COURTNEY and JOEL: [ holding their noses ]
EEEEWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
No, it’s just a sound I’m making with my mouth.

[ Makes the fart sound again ]

COURTNEY and JOEL:
EwWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
Guys, it’s not real. Watch. [ makes the fart sound again ]

[ COURTNEY stops holding her nose. ]

COURTNEY:
He’s right, Joel, it doesn’t stink.

JOEL:
I’m not taking that chance.

CURTIS:
Guys, we’re just falling victim to a stage convention.

COURTNEY:
A what?

CURTIS:
Sounds we make with our mouths are representations of real sounds when we want them to be.

MAN:
“You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.” Those were the dying words of my father, y’all. He played baseball professionally. It was baseball that eventually killed him. I’m sorry a baseball. A baseball killed my father. He choked on it. My father spent a good portion of his retirement trying to swallow baseballs, you guys. His last words were very difficult to understand.  I loved my father. I’m sorry, I liked my father. I love baseball.

[ He chews a pinch of gum. ]

I love baseball so much. I love watching baseball, playing baseball, and talking about watching and playing baseball, y’all. I once talked about baseball for the longest time, you guys. It was, like, non-stop. I timed myself. I clicked the stop watch and just started talking. And when I ran out of things to say it was thirty-six hours later. My mom says I got baseball in the blood somethin’ awful. Because I do. I literally have a baseball in my blood. I ground a baseball into a fine powder and injected it into my bloodstream. For no reason. I just did it, you guys. Like I said, I love baseball.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Did you know that baseball has a beautiful and rich history? Soldiers of the American Revolution played baseball y’all, like, all the time, you guys. It wasn’t the same exact game that we play today, but it was pretty damn close. December 25th 1776. Christmas Day, y’all. The Battle of Trenton. The American and British soldiers put down their muskets, climbed out of their trenches, and played a game of baseball y’all. We won and went on to face the Germans in a soccer match in World War I.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I would go to all of my dad’s games. I’d cheer him on and watch him treat women in a way that led to a lot of sexual confusion in my adult life, you guys. If a woman isn’t clearly interested in my advances within the first ten seconds of conversation I curl into the fetal position and ask her to pet my head. Isn’t that weird, you guys? I think so, but I can’t help it, y’all. It’s like breathing or goin’ to the bathroom. It comes naturally.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I’m also a natural on the field, you guys. I hardly ever practice, y’all, but when my friends get together for a quick game at the park I’m easily the fourth or fifth best. My coordination isn’t that good, so I can’t really catch, hit, run, or throw, but I can tell where a ball is going or what it’s going to do before it has any idea.

[ He chuckles to himself. ]

I’ll yell, “It’s heading for left field, y’all!” or, “You guys, I can feel it. He’s gonna bunt.” They start screamin’ at me that I need to keep my mouth shut, and if they wanted my help they would have let me play in the first place. My friends are great, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Sometimes they do let me play, and I like to think that when I step out on the field that I am in some way connected with the men who fight for my right to step out on said field. You know, the real every-day-heroes who are out there doin’ what they do day in and day out. Like firefighters and garbage men. Every time I see a fireman or a city sanitation department employee I say, ”thanks for baseball, y’all.” They kinda look at me real weird like they’re thinking, ”Finally. Someone said it.”

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I just love this game.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I mean, I love everything about it.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

The smells, the sounds, the tight white pants. Everything.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I also love this gum, y’all. I started playing baseball y’all when I was a kid, and since then have developed a serious addiction to Big League Chew. I chew it all the time, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

My physician and my dentist have begged me to quit The Chew. They kept tellin’ me that my teeth are near the final stages of decay and my kidneys will soon give out. I told them if they try to take away my Chew again I’d do somethin’ nasty. They tried and I kept my promise. I made some signs with poster board, glitter, and marker.

[ He pulls out a sign that says “these guys are bad doctors” and one that says ”honk if you hate Dr. Maxwel and hope his family gets sick.” ]

I warned them, you guys.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Set change with MUSIC. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A stage manager ENTERS, with a clipboard, followed by TWO PERFORMERS, one male and one female. ]

STAGE MANAGER
So, this is the performance space.

MALE PERFORMER
All right.

FEMALE PERFORMER
I think this will do.

STAGE MANAGER
Up there, you got lights. All kinds of lights to keep your performance lit. This is the stage. You’re pretty much walking on it now. Here you’ll be maintaining contact with the ground, I assume, most of the time, during your performance.

MALE PERFORMER
Great.

FEMALE PERFORMER
Great, like he said.

SM
Audience on all sides. Theater in the round. So, you know, play to all the sides. You’ll have some audience up there, too.

[ Points skyward. ] 
You know, suspended from the ceiling, or up higher, in the pleasure zeppelins. You’ve got some trapdoors in the stage, here and here.

[ Points down. ]

But you can’t use them, because you’re gonna have audience in there, too, watching the show through grates.

MP
Question.

SM
Sure.

MP
In our show, I wear a skirt at many points...

FP
Our show challenges a lot of gender stuff.

MP
Yes.

SM
We keep a pair of bicycle shorts for the performers. I’d recommend you wear the bicycle shorts underneath the skirt.

MP
There’s a problem there.

SM
Yes?

FP
Are they nylon bicycle shorts?

SM
I think so.

FP
He’s a got a severe nylon allergy.

SM
Then that isn’t going to work.

MP
Well, I should mention that I brought my own pair of non-nylon bicycle shorts.

SM
Great!

MP
So, I guess my question would be, do I have to wear your bicycle shorts? Because I would prefer to wear my own bicycle shorts.

SM
That won’t be a problem. Now, be alert during your performance, because there are these cabinets on the side of the stage. We also keep some audience in there. Every once and a while, one of these cabinets will pop open, and the audience member inside is gonna pop out. Now, they’re probably gonna be a little scared. They’ve been trapped in a cabinet, they don’t know how they got there, it’s dark, etc. Usually they kind of scream, a little bit, so you get this kind of haunted house feeling, like they’re really trying to scare you, but remember, they’re the ones who are scared, not you.

FP Are they in there as a punishment?

SM
Sort of. A lot of them were unkind to other people.

FP
Nice.

MP
Great.

SM
Anyhow, if that situation arises, someone on staff will just come and close the cabinet and everything will be fine. This corner is your backstage. It’s kind of tight.

[ They all move to one corner of the stage. ]

You’ll do your changes and such here.  We’ll get a curtain up for you, but it’s pretty tight, if you want to just get a feel for it...

[ MP and FP crowd into the little corner. ]

All right, the audience will see you there, so just get a little tighter in there ...

[ They are in as much as they can go. ]

Just, kind of, keep pushing, if you can, kind of cram yourself in there real tight.

FP
What if we just turn around?

MP
The backs of our costumes will be painted to match the stage.

FP
That’s part of the show.

SM
Try it.

[ They do, while staying tight in the corner. ]

Yeah, looks good.

[ They move out of the corner. ]

All right, that’s pretty much it. So, if you need anything else, you know who to ask.

MP
We’ll ask you.

SM
That’s right.

FP
A question.

SM
Sure.

FP
Our hotel, where we’re staying...

SM
I probably can’t help you with that.

FP
We want to bring you back to our hotel.

SM
Right.

MP
Please.

SM
For a sexual reason?

MP
Well...

FP
Ultimately, yes. Our show challenges a lot of gender stuff.

SM
Right, so we’d...

MP
We’d have sex together.

SM
OK, I’m probably not going to do that.

FP
Any reason why?

SM
I don’t want to, really, to be honest.

MP
We’ve really got our hearts set on doing sex with you, for the sake of the show, and other reasons as well.

FP
It’s important to us.

SM
Yes, but I really don’t want to.

FP
How about this? You say “no” for now, and we’ll continue to ask you until you change your mind and say yes.

SM
I think I’d probably have to try and stop you, legally, or something.

FP
Sure, sure.

MP
Well, think it over.

SM I have.

[ They begin to leave. ]

MP
We’re gonna get something to eat.

FP
We’re looking forward to making you have sex with us!

SM
No--

MP
Any recommendations for food in the area?

SM
Do you like Italian?

FP
It’s all right.

SM
There’s an Olive Garden two blocks down.

FP
They’re doing Italian now?

SM
Ask for the Italian menu.

MP
Can we have the Italian menu?

SM
No, ask them.

MP
Oh.

[ They start leaving again. ]

FP
OK, bye!

MP
See you later!

SM
Right, during your show--

FP [ interrupts quickly ]
No, sex!

[ MP and FP EXIT quickly. SM follows them to the exit. ]

SM
I’m not going to!

[ SM sighs and sits on the stage. ]

Performers, man.

[ Beat. ]

Then again, it did feel like there was something special about those two.

[ Beat. ]

Maybe I should have had sex with those two.

[ Beat. ]

Maybe I just made the biggest mistake of my life.

[ EXITS, running. Beat. He ENTERS again. ]

No, I decided that I didn’t.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Martin, a boy, with two business men toys and a whole array of boys’ toys. ]

MARTIN:
“Welcome Aboard” “Thank You, Sir!”

MARTIN’S FATHER: [entering]
Martin! What the.....? Are you up here creating a high powered business drama with romantic undercurrents?

MARTIN:
No Dad!

MARTIN’S DAD: [ taking the business men away ]
These are going in the trash, just like all those Barbies did, boy, so don’t even go looking for them, ya hear? Play with them soldiers and robot toys I got ya. Make em fight! One of em better die! Go hit a baseball with a bat! It’s what they do for christ’s sake, it’s what they do!

MARTIN:
Yes, Dad!

MARTIN’S DAD:
If I catch you creating tender moments between your toys, so help me god, I’ll throw all your toys away!

MARTIN:
Okay, Dad!

[MARTIN’S DAD exits. MARTIN starts to play with a robot and a soldier toy but then starts to set them up in a melodramatic scene. Voices for the robots and soldiers come from unseen voices on mics offstage. ]

MARSHA:
I love you, Sam.

SAM:
I love you, too, Marsha.

[ pause ]

SAM:
Marsha, I have something to confess to you. Something I've never told anyone outside my family. A deep, deep, dark, dark secret.

MARSHA:
Sam, you can tell me anything. Always. I will always listen and I will always love you no matter what.

SAM:
This is really hard to say Marsha. But I'm going to come out and say it. Marsha, I'm actually......a baseball.

[ MARSHA is horrified and breaks away from SAM. There is pain in her eyes. ]

SAM:
Do you no longer love me, Marsha? What happened to always? What happened to loving me no matter what?

MARSHA:
Sam. This can't be. This can't be true, it can't Sam.

SAM:
Marsha! Can't you love a baseball? I'm still Sam! I've just got red stitching and hard rubber center surrounded by cork and yarn! But in that ball of rubber, Marsha, is a heart that loves you deeply and will always be by your side.

MARSHA:
Oh, Sam! Oh NO! OH NO!

SAM:
Marsha! Just take a minute to get used to the idea. Once you've gotten past this initial shock, I'm sure it won't seem like any big deal at all!

MARSHA:
Oh, Sam, oh, my sweet Sam. It's not that. It's not that at all. It's just that....oh my dear Sam. I...I have a deep dark secret, too.

SAM:
Tell me anything. Together we can weather any storm.

MARSHA:
That's just the thing, Sam! We can't weather this storm. We can't! You see, I.....I am a baseball bat, Sam!

[ SAM is nonplussed. He reacts slowly, and calmly becomes more and more upset until he throws up. MARSHA runs to comfort him. ]

SAM:
GET OFF OF ME!!

MARSHA:
Sam! I didn't know! I didn't know you were a baseball! I would never have.......I would never have gotten in this deep if I'd known.

SAM:
When were you planning on telling me, Marsha?! When? After the wedding? After we'd had children?! When?

MARSHA:
I didn't think it would matter! I didn't think that me being a baseball bat had any bearing on anything!

SAM:
OH GOD! Oh, the pain the heart wrenching.......

[ Marsha hits SAM. ]

SAM:
What was that for?

MARSHA:
I'm sorry, Sam, I can't help it. It's in my nature. I....I'm trying to hold myself back.

[ MARSHA hits SAM. ]

SAM:
Can't you control yourself, Marsha?

MARSHA:
Do you know how long I've spent avoiding baseballs, Sam? My whole life! My whole life avoiding baseballs so that no one would ever get hurt! At least by my hand! And by this cruel twist of fate, I have unwittingly fallen in love with a baseball? The weight is too much to bear!

[ MARSHA hits SAM. ]

SAM:
Stop it! You're going to split my seams! Stop it!

MARSHA:
Sam! Sam, what are we going to do?! What about the wedding we've planned? The dreams of the children and picket fences?

SAM:
Why would you want those things, Marsha, why? So you can knock the fence down and injure our children?

MARSHA:
What about you? You'll just be breaking the windows of our homes, getting stuck in the rain gutters and flying unexpectedly into the neighbor's yard so we've got to climb the fence to get you!

SAM:
Having you around the home is dangerous, Marsha! Say we get robbed, what's to stop the intruder from using you against us?

MARSHA:
At least I’ll be useful in the event of a zombie apocalypse! What can you do if the dead rise from the grave? Give them a black eye!

SAM:
FOR THE LAST TIME THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS ZOMBIES! Typical bat, dumb as a post.

MARSHA:
Oh yeah?! Oh yeah!? You know what baseballs are? CHEATERS! What's to stop you from applying some foreign object to yourself, creating the illegal and highly controversial spitball so that you move in an atypical manner and really hurt someone? What's gonna happen then?

SAM:
I GUESS YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY AND HIT ME!

[ MARSHA hits SAM. They take a moment and both calm down ]

MARSHA: [ quietly ]
Oh, Sam, what if we'd had kids? They'd be some sort of horrible baseball, baseball bat hybrid.

[ SAM shudders ]

SAM:
This is horrible.

MARSHA:
I know. I know.

SAM:
Oh, the pain. The pain of remembering when we would walk hand and hand together along the boardwalk, the sea spray in our faces.

[ Water sprays in their faces ]

MARSHA:
Oh, Sam. The time when we went to the carnival and you won me that giant teddy bear and that carnie guessed your weight.

[ There is carnaval-type shouting “step right up!” and things like that ]

SAM:
All the romantic dinners we had at Olive Garden.

[ The baseball gives the bat a rose ]

MARSHA:
Our trip to the Northwest.

[ They are wearing flanel shirts ]

SAM:
Hanging out with my friends.

[ There are a bunch of other baseballs sitting around with them ]

MARSHA:
Gazing under the stars.

[ They’re making out rolling around and moaning ]

SAM:
That time we tried to go to that all-natural goat cheese farm and got lost on the way and ended up eating at that greesy spoon!

MARSHA:
Oh, my god, yeah! That waitress!

SAM: [ immitating ]
“What’s up, buttercups?”

[ The laugh for an extended period of time. ]

SAM:
Oh, god, we even went to a baseball game! It seems like that would have caused one of us to break down and reveal our terrible secret!

MARSHA:
My friend Rob was in that game but I couldn’t tell you because then you’d want to know how I knew him and what could I say? Family friend?

SAM:
Is there any way this is going to work? Is there any way that I can trust you?

MARSHA:
It's the very core of my nature to want to hit baseballs, Sam. I can't not hit baseballs, Sam.

SAM:
Yeah, I guess not.

[ MARTIN’S DAD enters. ]

MATRIN’S DAD:
Martin..... [ pauses ] Is that baseball and baseball bat set up in a tragic, romantic, Capulet-and-Montague type scene, son?

MARTIN:
No.

MARTIN’S DAD:
Don’t lie to me son. I can smell the romantic tension between those two pieces of sporting equipment down the hall.

MARTIN:
It’s not true dad!

MARTIN’S DAD:
Alright, well, now you can’t have any toys at all!

[ MARTIN’S DAD collects the toys and leaves. Martin starts to set up a scene with his elbow and butt. ]

MARTIN’S DAD:
Son, don’t you even think of setting faded southern belle and young rough neck sexual aggressor scene with your elbow and your butt! I never wanted a fancy boy! I just wanted a plain boy!

[ MARTIN is defeated. ]

[ A sign onstage: “EPA: EXCITED PEOPLES OF AMERICA -- meeting tonight”. Curtis, Courtney, and Joel are all onstage, wearing blazers with “E” patches. ]

COURTNEY [ standing ]
All right, gentlemen, I know that we’re all eager to get started.

JOEL
I’m really excited to get started.

CURTIS
Me too. I think this is an exciting organization, and I’m excited to be a part of it.

JOEL
I’m excited as well.

COURTNEY
I’m glad to hear that we all share each other’s excitement, because that’s really my vision for this social club. It’s about sharing excitement. It’s about creating a buzz. Do you feel the buzz?

JOEL
The buzz in the air?

CURTIS
Oh yeah, that buzz is exciting!

JOEL
So exciting.

CURTIS
The last time I was this excited I was sitting in a movie theater waiting for Jurassic Park to begin.

COURTNEY
Oooh, that was exciting.

CURTIS
Wasn’t it?

JOEL
We were just kids when it came out.

COURTNEY
Being a kid is so exciting. You can play and jump and run and ride your bike and watch Jurassic Park and it’s all just very fun and exciting, I think.

JOEL
Agreed. The last time I was this excited I was a little boy hiding in the backseat of my grandmother’s car waiting for her to get in so I could scare her.

CURTIS
That sounds exciting.

JOEL
Scare her like a little velociraptor.

COURTNEY
Oh, what happened?

JOEL
She had a heart attack.

COURTNEY
That must have been exciting.

JOEL
Oh yes, it was exciting. But it didn’t turn out well.

COURTNEY
Bad kind of exciting.

CURTIS
Yeah, I don’t like that kind of exciting.

JOEL
I’m feeling kind of sad now.

CURTIS
You’re not excited anymore?

COURTNEY
We could postpone the meeting until tomorrow if you’re not excited anymore.

JOEL
No, I’m still excited. I’m sad, but I’m also excited.

COURTNEY
Good. Let’s move forward. And let’s put that in our findings. “You can be sad but also excited at the same time.”

CURTIS
Who’s taking notes?

COURTNEY
Who’s excited to take notes?

[ Everyone raises their hands. They look around. ]

Let’s take turns taking notes.

JOEL
What an exciting compromise!

CURTIS
I’ll start.

[ He takes out a little notebook and a pen. ]

“You can be excited and sad at the same time.”

JOEL
“Being a kid is exciting.”

CURTIS
“Being a kid is exciting.”

COURTNEY
We’re making some very exciting progress.

JOEL & CURTIS
We are!

JOEL
What’s next on the agenda?

COURTNEY
Well, it’s time for a five minute break.

JOEL
I think it would be more exciting to skip the break and to keep listing things that are exciting.

CURTIS
I’m OK with moving forward without a break. I’m still feeling pretty excited.

COURTNEY
Well, we are here to be excited, after all.

JOEL
Great!

COURTNEY
We’ll just keep going for another hour and then we’ll call it a day.

JOEL
Excuse me?

CURTIS
Another hour sounds like just the right amount of excitement.

COURTNEY
Doesn’t it?

JOEL
Excuse me, but I’m very excited about this meeting. I’m excited about the meeting continuing. The idea of this meeting ending is not very exciting to me.

COURTNEY
Hold on a minute, Joel. Think of some other things that are exciting. Curtis and I need to have a quick meeting about the most exciting way to write things down.

JOEL
Exciting!

COURTNEY
It will be!

[ Curtis and Courtney move apart. ]

COURTNEY
I think that Joel has gotten too excited.

CURTIS
You think?

COURTNEY
We need to get him to calm down a little.

CURTIS
That runs counter to everything that we believe in. It’s totally against the values that we established when we started this meeting three minutes ago.

COURTNEY
But isn’t abandoning our values kind of exciting?

CURTIS
It is kind of exciting!

JOEL [ stands and shouts ]
Restaurants that offer a selection of breads!

[ Beat. ]

I’m sorry, I thought of that and I got so excited that I couldn’t wait for your side meeting to be over. Write it down!

CURTIS
“Restaurants with a selection of breads.”

COURTNEY
You know what else is exciting? Naptime.

CURTIS
Yes, another exciting aspect of being a child.

JOEL
Naps are exciting!

CURTIS
Warm milk, also.

COURTNEY
Yes, and green Nyquil.

CURTIS
And Benadryl.

COURTNEY
And sheep hopping over fences.

CURTIS
I’m writing all of these things down.

JOEL [ yawns ]
Yeah, these are all ... all ... exciting.

COURTNEY [ whispers to Curtis ]
It’s working.

CURTIS
How exciting!

JOEL [ jerks awake ]
Whoa! I nearly fell asleep! Thankfully, I started to wonder what I would dream about and that got me very excited! Wait a minute ... were you two trying to un-excite me to sleep?

COURTNEY
Yes, we were. Don’t make us get the blanket out.

JOEL
No, no, no, no! That’s not very exciting. Not at all.

CURTIS
Joel, we’re starting to define the boundaries of our excitement.

JOEL
I won’t have it. Look, no one’s leaving this room until we’ve listed everything in the world that’s exciting.

COURTNEY
You’ve gone mad!

JOEL
I excited my own grandmother to death. Imagine what I’ll do to you two.

CURTIS
Our friendly little club has turned into a battle of wills.

COURTNEY
I know! It’s kind of exciting! Scary but exciting, like Jaws.

JOEL
Oh, Jaws was exciting!

CURTIS
Like the Judge Roy Scream.

COURTNEY
Or the Flashback.

JOEL
Or the Texas Tornado!

CURTIS
Or the Tennessee Death Drop.

COURTNEY
Or a jetski.

JOEL
Or the history of international trade!

[ Curtis clutches his heart, gasps. ]

CURTIS
Excitement ... squeezing heart ... ack.

[ He dies. ]

COURTNEY
You did it! You just excited another human being to death!

JOEL
It’s just you and me now, bitch.

[ Courtney pulls out a blanket and throws it on Joel’s head. Joel immediately falls asleep. ]

Uh-oh, here I goooooo...

[ Joel snores. Courtney picks up the pad and pen that Curtis dropped. She begins to write. ]
 COURTNEY
Exciting findings: it is possible to excite another human being to death by talking about rollercoasters. Also, people are like canaries and fall asleep when you throw a blanket on them. Conclusion: A very exciting first meeting. I’m so excited! Like when I ride the Shockwave. Or the Texas Giant. Or the Rattler! Oh no, oh no! Meeting adjourned!

[She throws a blanket over herself and falls asleep. ]

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ SOUND CUE. Cue includes voiceover in a Werner Herzog-ish tone, as well as music and ambient sound effects mixed in as appropriate. ]

V/O
When we speak of origins, we must turn our minds to where things started -- at the beginning. Only then can we truly understand this thing that is the opposite of an ending. Let us speak of the origins of tonight’s show.

[ During the preceding line, the neighbors lurch onstage, one by one. Primitive postures and attitudes. Joel is gnawing on a chicken bone. Courtney is arranging sticks in her hair. Curtis is reading Mad magazine and giggling dumbly. ]

V/O
Three performers. To gaze into their eyes is to gaze into our barbaric past, to drink of thick, chunky darkness, like a smoothie that has been poorly blended.

[ During the preceding line, the neighbors greet each other. Sniffing, grooming, rituals. Avoid obvious monkey stuff, which is too obvious! More squirrel-like. ]

V/O
The performers have woken from slumber. They have foreseen this. They have prepared for the winter, which is Sketchfest, which is actually in summer, which is now.

[ During the preceding line, they look for and then find a stockpile of sketches hidden away. (Maybe in an oversized acorn or other silly object.) Once they get the sketches, they scatter them on the ground, eat them, etc. ]

V/O
The sketches they stored so carefully have waited for them, little papers to give them sustenance and love, now prepared for the embrace of teeth, tongue, lips, and buttocks.

[ Courtney begins to craft clothing out of the torn sketches, weaving paper into her hair. Joel and Curtis try to mate with them, clumsily. ]

V/O
Wakefulness dawns. This is familiar to them. Ancient memories stir. The lore of a thousand generations of ancestors. This is the time.

[ They stop what they’re doing, acknowledge each other, gather in the middle of the stage as a tightly clumped group. ]

V/O
They will face it together. Music, in introduction.

[ The theme music plays. ]

V/O
Enthusiasm and goodwill.

{ The neighbors get excited, wave at the audience. “How you guys doing tonight??” “All right!” Clapping, etc. ]

V/O
An assertive and proud display, a statement of purpose.

ALL
We are Your Terrific Neighbors and we’re going to do some sketches about different things!

V/O
And then, darkness.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

V/O
For now, they must gather up their silly props. Scurrying in the black night, creatures guided by fear and hunger. Off to their props they go, off to array themselves for the first sketch, off they go, off, off, stalling stalling stalling … yes. Um. Well, here is a joke. The joke begins … well, there is a doctor. And, of course, there is a man who comes to see the doctor. And the man is ill. The man is suffering from an ailment. And the doctor asks him to describe … OK, they’re ready now.

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

They dance suggestively, crawl towards each other on the ground and act foolishly. They end up on the ground, MAN crawling over WOMAN, who is scooting on her back. BOSS enters and doesn't look at either of them. ]

BOSS
Grant, McGennis.

[STOP MUSIC.

MAN and WOMAN struggle to get off the ground, mostly making it more difficult for the other person by grabbing them and pulling them down. They finally gather their stuff, put their coats and their glasses on. ]

WOMAN
Yes, sir.

BOSS
You're needed down in lab 3B.

MAN
Yes, sir.

[ MAN and WOMAN leave. Boss, looking at his clipboard walks across the stage and steps on the broken pencil halves. He looks down, sees them, looks left and right and then eats them.

"Back in Black" plays and he dances suggestively. ]

[ As he dances, JOEL and COURTNEY sneak by. ]

[ Two immigrants ENTER, male and female. They sneak quickly across the stage, keeping low. ]

MARIA
Ay! No! Do not look Felipe!

FELIPE
What, what is this?

MARIA
It is a terrifying vision, Felipe! A man who dances like a goat-man fool.

FELIPE
Ah, but Maria, this sounds hilarious!

[ Curtis exits. FADE MUSIC OUT. ]

MARIA
He is gone now.

FELIPE
You must know, Maria, that you will see more wonderful and amazing sights, now that we are in America.

MARIA
I--

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ They are quiet for a moment. ]

MARIA
Do you see anything, Felipe?

FELIPE
No, Maria. Merely a sound. No policia. We must be quiet and still for tonight, Maria.

MARIA
And tomorrow, our new lives in America shall begin.

FELIPE
Yes. But for now, we will camp here.

MARIA
And continue to practice our English, which is already very respectable?

FELIPE
Yes.

MARIA
Felipe?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria?

MARIA
Is it true what they say about American TV?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria.

MARIA
It has many smart and daring programs, especially on cable?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria. Especialmente on cable. Shows like Mad Men and Breaking Bad deliver gripping, thoughtful entertainment on a weekly basis.

MARIA
And what of Game of Thrones, Felipe?

FELIPE [ taking her by the shoulders ]
Maria, you must promise me you will read the books first.

MARIA
Si, Felipe, si!

FELIPE [ shaking her ]
Promise this to me!

MARIA
Felipe, you are hurting me.

FELIPE [ releasing her ]
I am sorry. But you must promise this to Felipe. It does not matter if you are not a fan of the fantasy genre. These books are very, very good.

MARIA
I promise this to you, Felipe, mi corazon, I shall not watch this show until I have read these books a thousand times.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ They huddle together and quiet down. ]

Es nada. But we must remain quiet, Maria.

MARIA
Yes. I will sit and dream of my new life.

[ They both sit against the back wall. Beat. Felipe pulls out a Kindle and starts using it. Beat. Maria notices, double takes. ]

Is that a Kindle?

FELIPE
Huh?

MARIA
When’d you get a Kindle?

FELIPE
Huh? Oh, a month maybe.

MARIA
You’ve had it this whole time?

FELIPE
Yes. Why?

MARIA
I just didn’t know you had a Kindle-

FELIPE [ pointing ]
Wait! Is that controversial Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio?

MARIA
No.

FELIPE
Oh.

MARIA [ quietly, while they are still huddled together ]
How did you get this Kindle, Felipe?

FELIPE
I purchased it online, Maria, and it was sent to me in the mail.

MARIA
Felipe ... what do you read on your Kindle?

FELIPE
Different things. It can hold very many books.

[ They move apart. ]

MARIA
How do you read when there is no wireless hotspot?

FELIPE
It has storage, and it can hold very many books. It does not need a wireless hotspot. It connects to a 3G network.

MARIA
Like my cellular phone?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria, like your cellular phone.

MARIA
What are you reading right now, Felipe?

FELIPE
David Foster Wallace’s posthumous work “The Pale King”.

MARIA
Do you like this novel, Felipe?

FELIPE
The work is frustratingly difficult in places. It's potholed throughout by narrative false starts and dead ends. Characters appear without introduction and disappear without cause.

MARIA
Ah.

FELIPE
Yes. And now I shall read in quiet, Maria, and we shall rest.

[ Beat. ]

MARIA
So, your Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
It is not a big deal, really!

MARIA
No big deal! No big deal! Had someone asked this morning, “Maria, the boy Felipe, the one you are running to America with, does he have a Kindle?”, I would have said no. Ay, poor fool Maria.

FELIPE
Maria...

MARIA
Perhaps I shall not dream of my new life in America. I shall dream of a life where Felipe confided to poor Maria that he had a Kindle.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ The huddle together. Felipe whispers. ]

I just wanted you to stop talking for a moment.

MARIA
Bastardo! Give me your Kindle!

FELIPE
Never!

[ They struggle over it. A voice calls from offstage. ]

VOICE
Drop that e-reader and scatter, Mexicanos!

[ Startled, they get up. ]

FELIPE
Dios mio! Maria! Run! It’s Glen Rockley!

MARIA
I have not heard of this man, Felipe.

FELIPE
He is a composite character created for satire.

MARIA
No! NO!!!

[ They run, EXITING the stage. (They leave the Kindle.) ]

[ Glen Rockley ENTERS. ]

[ PATRIOTIC MUSIC. ]

[ As he delivers his pitch to the audience, he moves back and forth across the stage. Perhaps he has a series of patriotic props: a rifle, a cowboy hat, etc. ]

GLEN
I’m Glen Rockley, and I’ve got a message for Arizona. So clean the crap out of your ears and pay attention!

America is facing a crisis along its borders. And Arizona is on the front lines!

Did you know that Mexican women are renowned throughout the world for their natural curves and earthy sensuality?

Did you know that Mexican men are just as renowned for their passionate lovemaking and their strong facial features?

I’ll bet you didn’t!

I’m Glen Rockley, and in my life I’ve been everything from a Sears assistant floor manager to a Sears floor manager. So you better believe it when I say I know a thing or two about a thing or two.

Did you know that, proportional to their percentage of the population, Mexican men and women are responsible for a greatly disproportionate amount of American sexual arousal?

I bet you didn’t, you damn idiot!

Sorry, I’m not mad at you.

I’m mad at the situation!

Fewer and fewer Americans are becoming aroused by natural-born American citizens. Our ability to produce erections domestically is being threatened.

I personally have been affected by these erections, because I’ve had them!

And after I masturbate, I am furious! Furious!

And the intense physical beauty of these illegal immigrants is matched only by the beauty and vibrancy of their culture!

Do you know how many colors are represented in an average dia de los muertos festival?

Are you tired of shedding tears over the plaintive beauty of Chicano poetry?

Are you tired of norteno music’s stranglehold on America’s Top 40 charts?

Well, I am!

[ He picks up the Kindle. ]

And as soon as I’m done re-reading Fuentes’s The Death of Artemio Cruz, I intend to do something about it!

I’m a single, childless man in my early fifties with free time and disposable income!

I’m just here to blow off a little steam, but it sure sounds like I’m running for office!

Maybe I should run for office!

Then again, that seems like a lot of work!

And your personal life becomes an open book!

Therefore, I have decided not to run for office!

So, thank you for your time, even though there is nobody here, except for the creatures of the Arizona desert! The coyote, the javelina, the cactus wren, you have been my audience tonight!

And I say goodbye to you, one and all!

Goodbye, banded gila monster, my favorite of all lizards! Goodbye!

[ He storms off. Joel enters as a lizard man. ]

LIZARD MAN:
Now there goes a fella who’s as American as lizard baseball, am I right?

You know, you spend a good piece of your lizard life gripping a lizard baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time. Those were the dying words of my lizard father, y’all. He played lizard baseball professionally. It was lizard baseball that eventually killed him. I’m sorry a baseball. A lizard baseball killed my father. He choked on it. His last words were very difficult to understand.  I loved my lizard father. I’m sorry, I liked my lizard father. I love lizard baseball.

[ He chews a pinch of gum. ]

Did you know that lizard baseball has a beautiful and rich history? Soldiers of the lizard American Revolution played lizard baseball y’all, like, all the time, you guys. It wasn’t the same exact lizard game that we play today, but it was pretty damn close. Lizard December 25th 1776. That’s Lizard Christmas Day, y’all! The Battle of lizard Trenton. The lizard American and lizard British soldiers put down their muskets, climbed out of their trenches, and played a game of lizard baseball y’all. We won and went on to face the lizard Germans in a lizard soccer match in lizard World War I.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I would go to all of my lizard dad’s games. I’d cheer him on and watch him treat lizard women in a way that led to a lot of sexual confusion in my adult lizard life, you guys. If a lizard woman isn’t clearly interested in my advances within the first ten seconds of conversation I squirt her in her lizard bosoms with my eye blood. Isn’t that weird, you guys? I think so, but I can’t help it, y’all. It’s like breathing or goin’ to the bathroom. It comes naturally.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I’m also a natural on the field, you guys. I hardly ever practice, y’all, but when my lizard friends get together for a quick lizard game at the park I’m easily the fourth or fifth best. I’ll yell, “It’s heading for left field, y’all!” or, “You lizard guys, I can feel it. He’s gonna bunt.” They start screamin’ at me that I need to keep my lizard mouth shut, and if they wanted my help they would have let me play in the first place. My lizard friends are great, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Sometimes they do let me play, and I like to think that when I step out on the lizard field that I am in some way connected with those everyday lizard heroes who make it possible for me to step out on said lizard field. You know, like lizard firefighters and lizard garbage men. Every time I see one I say, ”thanks for lizard baseball, y’all.” They kinda look at me real weird like they’re thinking, ”Finally. Someone said it.”

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I just love this game.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I mean, I love everything about it.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

The smells, the sounds, the tight white lizard pants. Everything.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I also love this gum, y’all. I started playing lizard baseball y’all when I was a kid, and since then have developed a serious addiction to Big League Lizard Chew. I chew it all the time, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

My lizard physician and my lizard dentist have begged me to quit The Chew. They kept tellin’ me that my teeth are near the final stages of decay and my kidneys will soon give out. I just can’t help it y’all. For every lizard woman that presses her body next to mine as she’s pushing her way through a crowded lizard bar to get to the bathroom but never makes eye contact with me, I pop a pinch of gum in my lizard mouth and pretend I’m chewing on her lizard skin. Sometimes I wish lizard baseball was a lizard woman that ignored me. Whoa! That’s weird, right? Did I say that out loud? I don’t know. Well, I guess I know what you guys want to see.

[ MUSIC PLAYS. Lizard-man dances. ]

[ Courtney enters as the owner of the strip club. ]

OWNER
Ladies, put your hands together for “Baseball” Larry, The Lonely Lizard.

[ Joel dances and exits. ]

OWNER
That’s just a little something for you ladies who like to keep it freaky. OK, ya’ll, we’re got plenty more hot fellas for you ladies. Are you ready??

[ Courtney keeps prodding the crowd until she gets a response. ]

OWNER
All right! But first, I’ve got to conduct a job interview.

[ Curtis enters as Randy and sits across from Courtney. ]

RANDY:
So, the concept is this.

OWNER:
I'm listening.

RANDY:
I'm a fireman.

OWNER:
Go on.

RANDY:
I've been fighting a fire, maybe across the street. Somewhere close by.

OWNER:
I see it.

RANDY:
I've been close to the flame. My body's sweaty and sooty.

OWNER:
I like it.

RANDY:
A voice calls out in the smoke, "Help! Help! Someone save us!"

OWNER:
The plot thickens.

RANDY:
The smoke is thick, nearly choking me. My vision is obscured. I put my arms before me. I feel like I'm swimming, pulling my way forward through the smoke.

OWNER:
The plot thickens more.

RANDY:
I feel vibrations. A pulsing rhythm. Through my squinted eyes, I see colored lights. Human forms, shaking and shouting in ecstasy. "My god," I wonder, "Am I still alive?"

OWNER:
The moment of truth.

[ Randy stands up. ]

RANDY:
As the smoke clears, I realize that I'm on a stage, surrounded by drunk women, some of them wearing tiaras. I look around. "How did I get here?" I seem to wonder.

OWNER:
Fair question.

[ MUSIC FADES IN. ]

RANDY:
These women want something from me, but what? The rhythm gets louder, and I realize: they want me to dance. My body resists, but the beat will have it's way. So I begin to dance. And before long, I begin to chafe at the restraint of my own clothing--

OWNER:
Let me stop you there.

[ Randy sits. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

RANDY:
So that’s how I envision it.

OWNER:
The story of our fireman.

RANDY:
Of course, the audience won't see any of that, but as a performer I think it's important to know where the character is coming from.

OWNER:
Let me stop you again.

RANDY:
OK.

OWNER:
You have clearly given this a lot of thought, Randy.

RANDY:
I want this gig.

OWNER:
I can see that. I appreciate your being so well-prepared. And I deeply appreciate that you recognize how crucial good storytelling is to female erotic experience.

RANDY:
Let me stop you there. Is that the faint smell of a "but" in the air?

OWNER:
But. I've seen stripping firefighters. I'm tired of stripping firefighters. I could go the rest of my life without another stripping firefighter. Even one as well-drawn as this. No offense.

RANDY:
Come on.

OWNER:
I'm quite serious.

RANDY:
Ugh. This empty pursuit of novelty. Would you run around the High Renaissance saying "No more angels and cherubs! I'm sorry guys, I've had enough of angels and cherubs!"

OWNER:
I might.

RANDY:
I could be a stripping blogger if that's "now" enough to you.

OWNER:
Randy, let me stop you again, this time.............here.

[ He stands, paces. ]

It’s not about novelty.

RANDY:
Larry the Baseball Lizard isn’t a novelty act?

OWNER:
Larry the Baseball Lizard is a lizard that plays baseball. It’s meant to be absurd, Randy.

RANDY:
Fine.

OWNER:
It’s about finding interesting variations on classical forms.

[ Calls offstage. ]

Isaac!

[ ISAAC ENTERS, dressed as a sea captain. ]

Take Isaac here. Isaac has taken the familiar stripping sailor character and turned it into something novel: the stripping fishing boat captain.

[ Owner narrates as Isaac performs. ]

Times have been hard for his community, which has always depended on the commercial fishing industry. But the pressures of a global marketplace and regional climate trends have begun to take their toll. Young men, turning their backs on the work of their fathers and grandfathers, are leaving town in droves. Enter our captain. He is still too proud to abandon the work he's done for thirty years, though he can find no hardy young seamen to work his ship. He moves from bar to bar, club to club, building to building. Until, half without noticing it, he wanders on to a colorfully lit stage in the middle of a club...

[ MUSIC FADES IN. Isaac prepares to dance. ]

ISAAC:
I'm looking for a crew.

[ Isaac aggressively grinds on Randy. ]

RANDY:
OK, OK, I get it.

[ MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

OWNER:
This is the kind of thing I'm looking for, Randy.

RANDY:
I see your point.

ISAAC:
What's the matter, young gun? Still looking for a gimmick to hang on mister money and the stone patrol?

[ Indicating his genitals. ]

RANDY:
Not that it's your business, but yes.

ISAAC:
Get to it, greencheeks. You know and I know the ladies no wanna scope-a da pee-pee unless you cut 'em a fat slice of storytime up front, you dig me?

RANDY:
Let me stop you there. I have ideas. I have plenty of ideas.

OWNER:
Oh, do you?

RANDY:
Yes.

ISAAC:
Not fireman, I hope?

[ Beat. Isaac laughs. ]

You kidding me? What is this, the amateurs of America club?

RANDY:
No such club exists, Isaac.

ISAAC:
Ha!

OWNER:
What else do you have?

[ Beat. ]

RANDY:
Stripping construction worker?

[ Isaac chuckles. ]

OWNER:
What's your angle?

RANDY:
Maybe I got a call from the club?

OWNER:
Let me stop you there. Now continue.

RANDY:
I think I'm there to do some tile work or something, and I'm looking for the bathroom when I find myself onstage...

ISAAC:
Oh boy. My mind-panties are wet already.

RANDY:
I suppose you have a better idea?

[ Isaac pauses. He has noticed something. ]

ISAAC:
Wait. Stop. There. Be still.

[ Gestures to the owner. ]

Give me your drink.

[ Owner hands Isaac his highball glass, which Isaac puts in Randy's hand. ]

Hold that. Wait.

[ ISAAC EXITS. ]

RANDY:
What's he do--

OWNER:
Let stop me you there. I've seen him get like this before. Just listen, and do.

[ ISAAC ENTERS with a black turtleneck sweater and some glasses. ]

ISAAC:
Put these on.

[ Randy begins to. ]

Stripping construction worker -- that’s stale as musty cardboard, kid. But I figured how we could take it to the next level.

[ Beat. ]

Stripping middle-aged architect terrified that he’s lost his gift.

[ Owner applauds slowly. ]

OWNER:
Isaac, you are a master.

ISAAC:
Follow me here.

[ Randy stands. ]

Don't stand. Sit.

[ Randy does. He performs as Isaac narrates. ]

Another late night at the office. The wife has gotten used to them -- hell, she doesn't even call anymore. A drafting pencil in one hand, a glass of scotch in the other, hunched over your desk. Is the drink there to steady the hand, as you've protested so many times before? Or is it there to temporarily silence that ever-present chorus of doubters in your brain, the critics who know you've lost your edge, the contractors who doubt your designs, the moneymen who no longer put faith in you? The chorus grows too loud for the drink to contend with. You put your pencil down. In a drunken haze, you wander from your office, seeking refuge from the prison life has become. By some mysterious path, you find yourself in a club, onstage. Feminine shrieks and squeals surround you. The smell of vodka and desire. The sound of music. Suddenly, your body does what comes naturally...

[ MUSIC FADES IN. ]

RANDY: [ dancing, quite into it ]
Who wants to see this load-bearing support?

OWNER: [ jumps to his feet ]
By jove, I think he's got it.

[ Curtis keeps dancing. Joel exits. Courtney addresses the crowd. ]

OWNER
All right, folks. Give it up one more time for Ambroos von Graffe, the melancholy architect!

[ Curtis exits. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

OWNER
All right ladies! You know what time it is?? Do you know what time it is?? That’s right, it’s 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon, and that means … we rent out our space for a community open mic night! And I have a piece that I would like to share.

[ She does a monologue entitled “Snapdragon”. ]

OWNER
OK, now put your hands together for … this guy!

[ Joel enters with his guitar. Courtney exits, then re-enters with percussion. They start playing. Joel sings. ]

SINGER:
Ten o' clock
It's time for fun
The sex commander is in the club
The ladies sit
The ladies wait
The sex commander is never late
Everybody make way for the sex commander

[ The SEX COMMANDER ENTERS, drink in hand. Looks to both sides. Nervous little movements. Pause. ]

SINGER:
Ladies beware of the sex commander
Can’t help but stare at the sex commander

[ SEX COMMANDER approaches a woman. ]

SC:
Hi. Oh, no. You mind if I -- oh no, that's fine. Uh, yeah. Hey could I just -- Uh. I guess I was wondering if -- Oh, I'll just ... yeah. No, that's cool.

SINGER:
You better look out for the sex commander

[ SEX COMMANDER approaches a woman. ]

SC:
Hey, you're Kelly's friend, right? Sure, we met at that thing at her house, like what, two months ago? Yeah. Yeah. Uh ...

[ Pause. ]

So, you've been all right, I guess?

[ Pause. ]

Yeah, uh -- What do you do for a living?

SINGER:
Pleasure and pain of the sex commander

[ SEX COMMANDER approaches a woman. ]

SC:
Hi. Uh, you know, I'm just going to be straightforward, you know? Because life's short. I've kind of had my eye on you for a while now -- it's just you're a very -- yeah, sorry. No big deal. Pardon me.

SINGER:
He's the sex commander
In the battle of love
He's the sex commander
Bringing sex from above

SC:
You know, I'm just trying to get along, like anyone else. There are nights when I'd like some physical companionship. Yes, I would like sex. I would like to have sex with someone who I am attracted to, and who is attracted to me. That's not wrong, is it? I'm not here to take advantage of anyone. I'm not here to violate anyone's human dignity. I just want to live!

[ Pause. ]

SINGER:
Sex commander, out in the club
Sex commander, looking for love
When I say love, you should, in your head, hear it as "sex"
'Cause it's the sex commander, commander of sex

[ SEX COMMANDER approaches a woman. ]

SC:
Hello, beautiful. Do -- I'm sorry, I immediately realize how stupid that sounds. Please enjoy your evening.

[ He backs away, shakes his head. ]

SINGER:
Another lonely night for the sex commander
Another porno night for the sex commander
Go and sex yourself, sex commander
Sex commander
Sex commander
Go and sex yourself, all night all right
Sex commander

SC: [ to singer ]
You're really not helping, do you know that?

[ SC exits. ]

[ Beat. ]

SINGER:
This is all I know how to do!

[ Singer opens his guitar case to put away his bass. ]

SINGER:
Some people, jeez, dang, I tell you what, I mean come on, it’s like jeez, I mean dang mutter mutter mutter.

[ When he opens his guitar case, he discovers three copies of a sketch, as well as three pencils. ]

JOEL
Hey, hey guys! I found another sketch that I wrote!

[ SOUND CUE: Voiceover. ]

V/O
Another winter discovery! Joy to their hearts! But in all living systems is a struggle for dominance, based on displays of worth. So too with sketches. Now, see our performers in the act of staged reading -- a vital yet brutal component of the creative process. Their rituals, however primitive, are complex. Turn, turn your eyes. Observe, warily.

[ During the preceding line, the neighbors all gather onstage. Exaggerated body language as Joel explains that he has found a new sketch. He distributes the copies, as well as a pencil for everyone. ]

JOEL
Hey guys, I think this is pretty good. Would you like to read it together?

CURTIS
Sure.

COURTNEY
Of course. Staged readings are an important part of our creative process.

CURTIS
Vital yet brutal.

JOEL
OK. Courtney, you read for the bank teller.

COURTNEY
Sounds good.

JOEL
Curtis, you read for the organ grinder.

CURTIS
Does he have an accent?

JOEL
Just feel it out.

COURTNEY
Does the bank teller have an accent?

JOEL
Yes, but I want you to feel it out.

COURTNEY
Give me a hint, though?

JOEL
Not Puerto Rican.

COURTNEY
OK.

JOEL
I'll read the stage directions.

[ They all look to their scripts. ]

JOEL
Act one, scene one.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Question?

COURTNEY
Right now, this feels more like a full-length play than a sketch.

JOEL
OK, could we hold notes until the end?

COURTNEY
I didn't want to forget.

CURTIS
Take the note, Joel.

JOEL
YOU TAKE THE NOTE! I'm sorry. I lost my temper. It won’t happen again. Can we start over?

CURTIS
Sure.

COURTNEY
It's just, when you start talking multiple acts and multiple scenes, it feels more like a play than a sketch.

JOEL
YOU FEEL MORE LIKE A PLAY THAN A SKETCH! I'm sorry. I promise that that won't happen again. I'll take the note. Let's start over, please.

[ beat ]

JOEL
Act one, scene one.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Already got that note.

[ Courtney lowers her hand. ]

JOEL
OK, act one, scene one. Lights up. A female bank teller, standing behind the counter of a bank. Her name tag says "Amber". Her hair is up in two curiously youthful pigtails. She is wearing a pale yellow sweater and a tan skirt, just past knee-length. Underneath, invisible to the audience for the entire duration of the sketch, is a red brassiere and mismatched blue-and-yellow stripe panties from Target.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

JOEL
Can we please hold notes till the end?

COURTNEY
I don't see how the underwear is relevant if the audience can't see it.

JOEL
I'm painting a word picture.

CURTIS
I get it. I mean, here she is, ostensibly, like, a bank teller in a yellow sweater, but then, red bra. Right? It's funny, because, like, red bra?

COURTNEY
I don't object to wearing a red bra. I already own a red bra, so it's convenient, in that respect.

JOEL
Is it the panties, then?

COURTNEY
Let’s revisit this section later.

CURTIS
I'll make a note.

[ Curtis makes a note in pen on the script. ]

CURTIS
I'm circling that section, and I'm writing "2V", as in visit twice or re-visit.

COURTNEY
I'll make a key for our notes so we can remember what they mean.

[ She makes a note in pen on her script. ]

COURTNEY
"2V" equals re-visit.

JOEL
Should we start from the beginning or just pick it up?

CURTIS
Let's keep the momentum going.

JOEL [ reading ]
The teller is finishing a half-eaten tofu pad thai in a styrofoam to-go container and daydreaming about the summers she used to spend at her grandfather's lake house. It is against bank policy to eat at the counter, but it is a slow part of the afternoon and her manager is out running a personal errand. Periodically, she scratches a persistent itch on her upper right arm. She is a woman of substantial regrets. She is currently in a solid long-term relationship, but it has been some time since she has experienced true erotic fulfilment.

[ Courtney raises her hand. ]

COURTNEY
Is grandfather's lakehouse a locus for her sexual regrets?

JOEL
Could be.

CURTIS
Not directly related, but they've become linked in her mind somehow.

COURTNEY
Sure, that would be funny.

JOEL
That would be really funny.

CURTIS
I'll write it down.

[ He makes a note. ]

CURTIS
I’m circling the words “grandfather’s house,” and next to it I’m drawing an extremely graphic image of two people having intercourse, just really going at each other’s genitals with everything they’ve got, and next to that I’m drawing a sad face.

COURTNEY
I’ll add that to the key.

[ She begins doodling, looking over to Curtis’s note. ]

COURTNEY
“Locus of sexual regret.”

JOEL
What do you guys think of it so far?

COURTNEY
It’s definitely funny, but I'd like to see where it goes.

JOEL
I'd like to see where you go! I'm sorry. I 100% guarantee that that won't happen again. There was absolutely nothing in your statement to make me mad.

CURTIS
Let's continue.

JOEL [ reading ]
The bank teller sighs.

COURTNEY [ sighs, reading in a Puerto Rican accent ]
This pad thai is no good.

[ Joel raises his hand. ]

COURTNEY
I’m feeling it out.

JOEL
I definitely don’t want the Puerto Rican accent. Can I be honest? I thought you might do it, and that’s why I said not to do it earlier.

COURTNEY
I appreciate your honesty.

CURTIS
Courtney, are there other accents that you like to do?

COURTNEY No.

CURTIS
That could be a problem.

COURTNEY
How about this? I keep the accent, but you cut my dialogue.

CURTIS
Then you both win.

JOEL
I don’t know. Your dialogue is pretty important to the sketch.

CURTIS
Joel, instead of resisting new ideas, let’s put them on their feet and see if they work.

JOEL
OK. We’ll try it without you having any dialogue.

COURTNEY
But with me having a Puerto Rican accent.

CURTIS
You both win!

JOEL
OK

[ Reading. ]

JOEL
An organ grinder enters the bank, all suspenders and mustachios -- a quirky fellow with a spring in his step. He has his organ, but a thin leash dangles from his wrist with no monkey on the end. He does not look at the leash. Perhaps he does not even recognize the absence of his monkey. Perhaps he knows his monkey’s whereabouts. Perhaps he never even had a monkey at all.

CURTIS
Nice ambiguity.

JOEL
It’s funny, isn’t it?

COURTNEY
It is funny!

JOEL [ reading ]
The organ grinder approaches the teller, who regards him warily.

COURTNEY
And we cut the line here.

JOEL
OK, so it’s your line.

CURTIS [ reading, Puerto Rican accent ]
I’d like to make a deposit.

JOEL & COURTNEY
Good choice.

CURTIS
Thanks!

JOEL
Do it again.

CURTIS
I’d like to make a deposit.

[ Courtney and Joel look at each other, shake their heads. ]

COURTNEY
No, lose it.

CURTIS
I’m feeling it out.

[ Courtney shakes her head. ]

JOEL
Start over.

CURTIS [ reading ]
I’d like to make a withdrawal.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Yes, here’s my slip.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Yes, it’s been a fine day for me.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
What do you mean?

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. Curtis laughs. ]

CURTIS
Not at all.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

CURTIS
Oh no, he’s back at the office.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

JOEL [ reading ]
The teller reaches beneath the counter for a large bag of peanuts. She places them on the counter. The organ grinder takes them.

CURTIS [ reading ]
I should hurry back. The boss hates it when I’m late.

[ They look over at Courtney. She says nothing. ]

JOEL [ reading ]
Quiet desolation settles over the teller’s face. It’s as simple as that, then, she seems to think. Lights down, slowly. Then, lights back up again. And then, more slowly this time, lights down again. And then, a tiny shaft of light. Then that fades slowly. Then, three sound cues, to be determined.

[ Joel starts giggling. ]

JOEL
I think that the things that I write are good.

[ He starts reading again. ]

JOEL
OK. Act one, scene two.

[ Curtis and Courtney both raise their hands. ]

JOEL
Guys, please. It should only be another two hours, and then we can do notes.

CURTIS
I have a question about why my accent was disallowed.

COURTNEY
There are five things in the sketch that don’t work for me. One, bra stuff. Two, I don’t have lines anymore. Three, too long. Four, too stagey. Five, it sucks more than anything ever and isn’t funny.

JOEL
You suck more than anything ever and aren’t funny! I’m sorry. I’m really sorry. No I’m not!

CURTIS
Guys! Friendship hug, right now.

[ Joel and Courtney get up and hug reluctantly. ]

CURTIS
That’s better.

JOEL
OK.

COURTNEY
OK.

JOEL
I’ve really thought about what you have to say.

COURTNEY
I appreciate that.

JOEL
And I think we ought to break up the troupe.

COURTNEY
You always say that.

JOEL
But I mean it this time. There are places I need to go, creatively, and you guys aren’t willing to follow me there.

COURTNEY
I respect your decision, Joel.

JOEL
I’m quitting the troupe.

CURTIS
Joel, we both hear you. And I think we’re in agreement here: We respect your decision to quit.

JOEL
I’m quitting.

COURTNEY
Yes, Joel.

JOEL
Fine.

[ Joel heads to the door, but then he stops and waits with his hand on the doorknob. ]

COURTNEY [ to Curtis ]
Should we stop him?

CURTIS
No. We have to let him go.

[ They hold hands tightly, close their eyes. Joel sniffs. Joel makes a low, moaning sound. Curtis and Courtney hold each other’s hands even more tightly. ]

WRITER:
Where do I begin? How do I describe my time with the master? With Mr. Stanislav Actislavski himself? I certainly had heard whispers of him in the high school drama room, but we had no need for acting styles with our half-cocked restagings of Our Town and Carousel. I heard rumblings of him in my college drama courses and during load ins, but we paid little attention to old masters while staging our crude, gender challenging modernizations of Euripides and Aristophanes. But the first time I saw one of his pupils on the silver screen, I was entranced. The rawness, the vulnerability was seeping from the rafters of the theater and I could only think one thing: "Who taught him how to do that?" I made my way to the village where Master Activslavski kept his small, no 

[ WRITER backspaces ] 

modest teaching space and theater. I remember my first interaction with him as if it were yesterday. By the time I met him he was 95 years old but still sharp as a tack. 

[ The scene seamlessly melds into an interaction between STANISLAV ACTISLAVSKI and WRITER. STANISLAV ENTERS using a cane and only yells in a monotone. WRITER kneels before STANISLAV. ]

STANISLAV:
Don't kneel, you imbecile. Get up! So, you want to be an actor. 

WRITER:
Yes, master. Very much.

STANISLAV:
Don't call me master, what are you a dog?

WRITER:
Yes, master.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
There's nothing very special about you. You're not particularly good looking, not particularly charismatic or interesting....What's your name, boy?

WRITER:
Daniel, master. 

STANISLAV:
Daniel, there is a coffee shop in the Bronx called Great Joe's Adventure Cafe and Muffler Repair. Do you know it? Bring me a small black coffee from there by the time my next class starts and I will bring you on as my apprentice.

[ WRITER RETURNS to his writing station while STANISLAV gets ready for his acting class he's about to teach ]

WRITER:
And get that small cup of coffee I did. And many more following that. Sure, it was a two hour round trip subway ride each day for what all I could figure was a slightly less than mediocre small cup of coffee. And sometimes I'd have to go twice a day, leaving me to wonder why he didn't just order a large cup of coffee on the first trip. But it was worth it. I learned so much under the master. I learned that he'd been hit by a freight train while still living in Russia and that's why he used a cane. I learned that he'd lost the use of his normal speaking voice whilst traveling to the states by boat and had to yell everything he said. I learned the true root of human need and how to touch the ET inside. ET, that's what ACTISLAVSKI called your "emotion tip". Everyone has one.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I need you!

[ WRITER EXITS, picks up a coffee from offstage and ENTERS in as if he's late for class ]

WRITER:
I'm sorry, Master, there was a MTA strike. I had to walk the whole way.

STANISLAV:
Daniel, get on the stage with Anna.

[ ANNA ENTERS from the audience, as if she's in the class ]

STANISLAV:
Do you think Anna's attractive?

DANIEL: [ embarrassed ]
Uh, yeah.

STANISLAV:
You're wrong. She's just as boring and unattractive as you are. Let's see if we can't breathe some life into you two turds on a log. Look at her. Really look into her eyes. Say what you see.

DANIEL:
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
No, no, no, no! Don't talk to her! Don't speak directly to her! Like she's a person! She's not a person!

DANIEL: [ dismissively ]
You have brown eyes.

STANISLAV:
Very nice! How did that feel?

DANIEL:
Good, uh, really good.

STANISLAV:
Anna. Look into Daniel's eyes. Say what you see.

ANNA:
You seem pensive.

STANISLAV:
Oh, god. Boring! That is the most boring thing I have ever heard. Listen, when are you people going to learn? 

[ STANISLAV addresses the class/audience and then conducts them like an orchestra ]

STANISLAV, DANIEL, ANNA:
Touch the ET inside.

STANISLAV: [ exasperated ]
Thank you! Anna, try again.

ANNA:
You seem........pensive?

STANISLAV:
Finally! How was that for you?

ANNA:
I, uh, really felt my ET.

STANISLAV:
Good, good girl. I think you've really learned something today. I think you might have had a breakthrough. In fact, you get to start doing face ups. Daniel, sit here.

[ DANIEL sits next to STANISLAV ]

STANISLAV:
Now Anna, I want you to kneel on the ground. Good. Put your face up. Okay. Now I want you to think of the most painful thing that could ever happen to you. You got that?

[ ANNA nods ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Now multiply that times 43. You should really feel your ET growing. It should feel like it's just touching the inside of your ribs. It should grow and grow till you feel it pushing on the walls of your chest and then it will feel like it's going to poke out of your heart.

[ ANNA is on the floor, weeping ]

STANISLAV:
Good, good, that's enough for today. 

[ ANNA goes back to her seat, sniffling ]

STANISLAV:
Daniel, I want you to get up and do a window. Did you bring your Cleaning Object?

DANIEL: [ taking out a handkerchief ]
Yes.

STANISLAV:
Tell me about it.

DANIEL:
It was my Grandfather's. My Grandmother kept it on her at all times after he died. Then, after she died, I got it.

STANISLAV:
I asked you to bring in something personal.

DANIEL:
But my Grandfather...

STANISLAV:
I heard what you said. It needs to be something personal. I'm looking for the towel you used to clean the blood off your face after that drunken fight. Or that shirt you were wearing when you first banged that really hot piece of ass you'd been wanting for months. What's this, a rag your Grandpappy carried around with him? Crap. [ pause ] It will have to do for today. Do your window.

[ DANIEL mimes wiping a window ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. You want to clean the window without really touching it. Really connect with your cleaning object. Stop.

[ DANIEL stops ]

STANISLAV:
Don't wipe the window. [ slowly as if speaking to someone who is hard of hearing ] Clean it.
[ DANIEL starts the wiping motion again ]

STANISLAV:
Good. Good, Daniel.

[ DANIEL returns to his typing chair while STANISLAV continues the class like his still there ]

DANIEL:
The things I learned. I learned that people don't have brown eyes, they have 

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes. And people don't seem pensive. They seem....pensive? I learned how to stop wiping windows and start CLEANING windows. And you know what else. I got to deliver the eulogy at the old man's funeral. He hasn't died yet, but he figured he'd have a funeral while most of the people he knew were still alive. You know what else? I married that girl with the

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes.

[ ANNA enters with the small cup of coffee and gives it to DANIEL ]

ANNA:
Sweetie, you seem.....pensive?

DANIEL:
Oh, sweets, I was just jotting down some of my experiences with the old man. Come here. Let me look into those

[ dismissively ]

brown eyes.

ANNA:
Oh, Daniel. Here.

[ She hands DANIEL some bloody panties and she takes out a wadded up tissue and they clean the windows. ]

[ LIGHTS UP on RANDY and the OWNER of the strip club, seated and in conversation. Owner is drinking from a highball glass. ]

RANDY:
So, the concept is this.

OWNER:
I'm listening.

RANDY:
I'm a fireman.

OWNER:
Go on.

RANDY:
I've been fighting a fire, maybe across the street or something. Somewhere close by.

OWNER:
I see it.

RANDY:
I've been awfully close to the flame. My body's sweaty and sooty.

OWNER:
I like it.

RANDY:
A voice calls out to me in the smoke, "Help! Help! Someone save us!"

OWNER:
The plot thickens.

RANDY:
The smoke is thick all around me, nearly choking me. My vision is obscured. I put my arms before me. It's so thick I feel as though I'm swimming, pulling my way forward through all that smoke.

OWNER:
The plot thickens, thick as smoke.

RANDY:
I begin to feel vibrations. A rhythmic pulse. Through my squinted eyes, I discern colored lights. Human forms, shaking and shouting in ecstasy. "My god," I wonder, "Am I still alive?"

OWNER:
The moment of truth.

[ Randy stands up. ]

RANDY:
As the smoke clears from my eyes, I realize that I'm on a stage. I'm surrounded by drunk women, some of them wearing tiaras. I look left, I look right. "How did I get here?" I seem to wonder.

OWNER:
Fair question.

[ MUSIC FADES IN. ]

RANDY:
These women want something from me, but what? The rhythmic pulse crystallizes. A modern interpretation of a familiar disco groove. Now I know. They want me to dance. My body resists at first, but the beat must have it's way. And I begin to dance. And before long, I begin to chafe at the restraint of my own clothing--

OWNER:
Let me stop you there.

[ Randy sits. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

RANDY:
So, that basically, is how I envision it.

OWNER:
That's the story of our fireman.

RANDY:
Right. Now, of course, the audience doesn't see any of that, but as a performer I think it's important to know where my character is coming from.

OWNER:
Let me stop you again, but this time here.

RANDY:
OK.

OWNER:
You have clearly given this a lot of thought, Randy.

RANDY:
I want this gig.

OWNER:
I can see that. I appreciate the fact that you came to me so well-prepared. And I deeply appreciate the fact that you recognize how crucial narrative is to the female erotic experience.

RANDY:
Mmmmm. Is that the faint smell of a "but" in the air?

OWNER:
But. But. I've seen stripping firefighters. I'm tired of stripping firefighters. I could go the rest of my life without seeing another stripping firefighter. Even one as well-drawn as this.

RANDY:
Come on now.

OWNER:
I'm quite serious.

RANDY:
See, this is the problem. The empty pursuit of novelty. Would you run around the High Renaissance saying "No more angels and cherubs! I'm sorry, I've just had enough of angels and cherubs!"

OWNER:
Yes, Randy, I might.

RANDY:
I could be a stripping blogger if that's "now" enough to you.

OWNER:
Please, Randy.

[ He stands, paces. ]

The point isn't to chase the new. The point is to find interesting variations on classical forms.

[ Calls offstage. ]

Isaac!

[ ISAAC ENTERS, dressed as a sea captain. ]

Take Isaac here. Isaac has taken the familiar figure of the stripping sailor and turned it into something novel: the stripping fishing boat captain.

[ Owner narrates as Isaac performs. ]

Times have been hard for his community, a community that has always depended on the commercial fishing industry to bolster its economy. But the pressures of a global marketplace, not to mention regional climate trends, have begun to take their toll. Young men, rather than than getting into the work of their fathers and grandfathers, are leaving town in droves. Enter our captain. He is still proud, too proud to abandon the work he's done for thirty years, though he can find no hardy young seamen to work his ship. He moves from bar to bar, club to club, building to building. Until, half without noticing it, he wanders on to a colorfully lit stage in the middle of a club...

[ MUSIC FADES IN. Isaac prepares to dance. ]

ISAAC:
I'm looking for a crew.

RANDY:
OK, OK, I get it.

[ MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

OWNER:
This is the kind of thing I'm looking for, Randy.

RANDY:
I see your point.

ISAAC:
What's the matter, young gun? Still looking for a high concept to hang on mister money and the stone patrol?

[ Indicating his genitals. ]

RANDY:
Not that it's your business, but yes.

ISAAC:
Get to it, greencheeks. You know and I know the ladies no wanna scope-a da pee-pee unless you cut 'em a fat slice of storytime up front, you dig me?

RANDY:
Yes, Isaac. I have ideas. I have plenty of ideas.

OWNER:
Oh, do you?

RANDY:
Yes.

ISAAC:
Not fireman, I hope?

[ Beat. Isaac laughs. ]

You kidding me? What is this, the inaugural meeting of the first chapter of the amateurs' club of America?

RANDY:
No such club exists, Isaac, and you know that.

ISAAC:
Ha!

OWNER:
What else do you have?

[ Beat. ]

RANDY:
Stripping construction worker?

[ Isaac chuckles. ]

OWNER:
What's your angle?

RANDY:
Maybe I got a call from the club? I think I'm there to do some tile work or something, and I'm looking for the bathroom when I find myself onstage...

ISAAC:
Oh boy. The panties in my mind are wet already.

RANDY:
I suppose you have a better idea?

[ Isaac pauses. He has noticed something. ]

ISAAC:
Wait. Be still.

[ Gestures to the owner. ]

Give me your drink.

[ Owner hands Isaac his highball glass, which Isaac puts in Randy's hand. ]

Hold that. Wait.

[ ISAAC EXITS. ]

RANDY:
What's he do--

OWNER:
Wait. I've seen him get like this before. Just listen, and do.

[ ISAAC ENTERS with a black turtleneck sweater and some glasses. ]

ISAAC:
Put these on.

[ Randy begins to. ]

Stripping construction worker. It's a no-go, kid. Stale as musty cardboard. But it got me thinking about how we could take it to the next level.

[ Beat. ]

Stripping middle-aged architect fearful that his gift has abandoned him.

[ Owner applauds slowly. ]

OWNER:
Isaac, you are a master.

ISAAC:
Follow me here.

[ Randy stands. ]

Don't stand. Sit.

[ Randy does. He performs as Isaac narrates. ]

Another late night at the office. The wife has gotten used to them -- hell, she doesn't even call anymore. A drafting pencil in one hand, a glass of scotch in the other, hunched over your desk. Is the drink there to steady the hand and help you create freely, as you've protested so many times before? Or is it there to temporarily silence that ever-present chorus of doubters in your brain, the critics who know you've lost your edge, the contractors who doubt your designs, the moneymen who no longer put their faith in you? The chorus grows too loud for the drink to contend with. You put your pencil down. In a drunken haze, you wander from your office, seeking experience in the evening light, seeking a refuge from the prison life has become. By some mysterious path, you find yourself in a club, onstage. Feminine shrieks and squeals surround you. The smell of vodka and desire. The sound of music. Suddenly, your body does what comes naturally...

Ah, yes, Mr. Anderson, I see that you're a current customer.

MAN:
I am.

CLERK:
You're renting a car with us right now, I see.

MAN:
Regrettably so.

CLERK:
One of our Kias.

MAN:
True.

[ Beat. ]

CLERK:
Can I help you with something?

MAN:
Can you?

[ Beat. ]

I'm not sure you can.

[ Beat. ]

About this car I am currently renting from your so-called "business"...

CLERK:
Yes, Mr. Anderson?

MAN:
The car is unsatisfactory. Per the terms of our rental agreement, I was to enjoy certain features and options.

CLERK:
Yes, I see you paid a little extra for an iPod dock and a GPS device. Have those not worked out for you?

MAN:
The iPod dock has worked inconsistently. As for the GPS unit, it has proven to be more trouble than it's worth.

[ Pause. ]

CLERK:
Well...

MAN:
I don't care to hear any snake-oil talk. I'm unsatisfied with this rental car. I made a transaction in good faith. I held up my end of the deal. I am a man. A grown man, with dignity, and I stand up for myself. I am returning this rental car!

[ He pulls out some keys and tosses them on the desk/counter. ]

The car is parked outside your building. I believe you'll find it's in the same condition as I was given it.

CLERK:
All right, Mr. Anderson. I'm sorry it didn't work out.

MAN:
Save your words.

[ Uncomfortable pause. ]

CLERK:
If you were dissatisfied at all, Mr. Anderson, we could discuss a partial refund or credit on your next--

MAN:
No!

[ He raises his hand in a "stop" gesture. ]

You can buy many things in this world. But you can't buy a grown man's good opinion.

[ Beat. ]

Good day to you.

[ The man walks away. At a distance, he takes a pen and a piece of paper out of his pocket. He makes marks on the paper. ]

Another point for Garrett Anderson. Another loss for the dehumanizing core of modern capitalism.

[ Laughs, shakes his fist at the sky. ]

You'll never catch up at this rate, you bastards!

[ LIGHTS UP ON SAM. He is sitting at his desk looking over paperwork. ]

SAM:
... And because he finishes all his work on time, Principal Sam Thompson leads a parade in his own honor. Oh my, what a glorious procession, its majesty shadowed only by the many accomplishments of Nucksua County's brightest principal.
  
[ GEORGE, a janitor, ENTERS. He is holding a mop. ]

GEORGE:
I can clean now, Sam?

SAM:
Hello, George.

GEORGE:
I am the janitor.

SAM:
I know, George.

[ George begins mopping by bouncing the mop on the floor. ]

GEORGE:
Sam, everyday I see you. Everyday I clean. I clean the floors. I clean your desk. I clean your file cabinets.

SAM:
Well, George, you do clean my office.

GEORGE:
I'll clean your office now. Every morning you walk in to your office and your desk shines. Your floor sparkles. Everything is clean.
 
SAM:
George, tomorrow I'll walk in and see that my desk wasn't cleaned. The floor will still be dirty. The file cabinets will still be covered in dust.

GEORGE:
But every day I clean.

SAM:
Every day I am in my office and working at 6:30. That's AM, George. 6:30 AM. You tend to ooze through the front doors around noon.

GEORGE:
Every day I clean.

SAM:
You creep into my office at 3:15. You mop. You dust. You polish. But, nothing is ever clean.

[ George stares blankly. ]

And most days, like now, you seem to be lost in your own world.

[ George giggles. ]

Is something funny?

GEORGE:
You look different in my mind pictures.

SAM:
Okay. You also say weird things like that.

GEORGE:
Every day I clean. I work hard and clean the school.

SAM:
You are simply the most ineffective worker I have ever seen.

[ George makes cleaning motions towards Sam. ]

SAM:
Right. First, let's discuss your conflicts with the school's hours of operation.

GEORGE:
I wouldn't care if you were late.

SAM:
Unfortunately, that doesn't matter. We need to discuss your constant tardiness.

GEORGE:
If you were late every day, I wouldn't make you feel bad.

SAM:
Again, that doesn't matter.

GEORGE:
Well it should. If you were bad at your job I wouldn't care, and I would still like you. And it would look a little something like this.

[ GEORGE moves his hands and wiggles his fingers. ]

 This is what it would look like, this is what it would look like, this is what it would look like...

GEORGE:
Where have you been, Sam? I've been waiting.

SAM: [ offstage, as Courtney moves her mouth ]
I'm sorry. I was the president for 15 hours.

GEORGE:
You don't say! 

SAM:
Everyone else in the line of succession was raptured into heaven while playing Pictionary.

GEORGE:
I didn't hear about the rapture.

SAM:
Well, God changed his mind and everyone was reverse-raptured. So now I'm not the president anymore. So I came to work!

GEORGE:
That is something!

SAM:
Let's get to it! You have such beautiful legs.

GEORGE:
Thank you, Sam.

SAM:
I love you.

Okay.

GEORGE:

SAM:
And I was painting your portrait?

GEORGE:
It was your idea. I don't discriminate.

SAM:
George, in some ways I admire your rich fantasy life, bu ...

GEORGE:
But, you're giving me a promotion. And I accept!

SAM:
See, this is what I'm talking about. I'm not giving you a promotion.

GEORGE:
No, I'm giving you a promotion.

SAM:
George, you can't promote me.

GEORGE:
Sure I can! You've earned it. By giving me a promotion. Now put your brush down and take a break.

SAM:
No, wait -- OK, let's start over.

GEORGE:
I can clean now, Sam?

SAM:
You're fired.

GEORGE:
What's that?

COURTNEY: [ voicing SAM offstage ]
I said you're fired!

[ beat ]

What was that?

I'm turning into a woman?

NO!

[ CURTIS wrenches in pain and freezes. ]

GEORGE:
You see, this is the problem. A 9 to 5 job is the only thing keeping my mind pictures in check. Now that I'm unemployed, things are gonna get pretty weird. My clothes are melting now.

[ He removes his shirt, revealing a face painted on his chest. ]

You see? This is my father. He doesn't like to be seen. Now he's awfully disappointed in us.

[ He begins squeezing his belly. ]

"Hey. Put dat shirt back on. Put dat shirt back on mah face."

  COP:
There's someone down there?

  [ Cop tries to get a look. Woman stops him. ]

  WOMAN:
Serves him right, the bastard. Twelve years, I give to him. He won't marry me, he can't hold down no honest labor and I give my life to him anyhow. He's no good, mister. Ain't nothin' but a big stinking brute. And when he gets drunk, he gets awful mean. But you know, other times, when he gets drunk...

  [ She drifts off, seemingly in a fond reverie. ]

... he falls down a well.

COP:
I'll radio for help.

  WOMAN: [grabs him ]
Don't you call nobody, mister officer.  Ain't no emergency response team gonna drag his soul back from hell.

COP:

  WOMAN:
Only thing pusht you down was your own goddam drunk and stupid feet!

COP: [ into well ]

 Mister officer, I feel like my guts done busted up on me. My bones is on fire. My brain feels like to a tin cup in a mudslide.

WOMAN:
Now you know what it's like, you bastard!

COP:
Look, I'm going to call for some backup and we're gonna get you out of there.

VOICE:
 No no no, mister! Don't you call for nobody! I'll be all right. I can see my way out this well myself when I'm ready.

  WOMAN:
He's skeered you gonna drag his no-good ass back off to jail where it belong. Cuz his ass ain't no good. Cuz he's a dumb piece of trash with nothin' better to do but take poor young girls out their homes and tear they hearts to pieces.

VOICE:
You lost the right to tell me what to do when you pusht me down the damn well!

COP:
All right. That's enough. Everyone take a deep breath; I'm going to call the rescue team.

WOMAN: [ steals cop's gun ]
You ain't goin' nowhere's to tell nobody nuthin'. He's got his own phone down there he can call the po-lice with but he's too dumb to work it!

Aw, baby! I love you so much. I cannot wait to make sweet love to you in our marital bed! You!

WOMAN:
I'ma kick you in the balls and then use them balls to make me a womb baby! And then one day it'll come out me and it'll be an outside baby, a real person baby!

VOICE:
I'ma be so good to that baby! I'ma share my 500 pies with him.

WOMAN:
I'ma tell that baby the story of how you fell down the well. And then I'ma teach that baby how to drive.

VOICE:
I'ma build a home for us with my bare hands right here at the bottom of this well. And then I'ma build a baby house right next door.

SON:
I am! I am!

MOM:
I'm not entirely sure about this, Harold.

DAD:
What's not to be sure of?

MOM:
I guess I'm just an old-fashioned frannie, but I was looking forward to a more traditional vacation this year.

DAD:
Honey, between the discomfort of long auto trips and the many inconveniences of air travel, more and more families are choosing to spend their vacations in de-commissioned Soviet submarines this year than ever before.

MOM:
Stop quoting that brochure back at me!

SON:
I can't wait to visit the Puerto Rico Trench, dad!

[ Reading from a guide book. ]

It says here that it is located on the boundary between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean!

DAD:
Yes, son, isn't it nice that we've chose a family leisure option with a significant educational component?

SON:
Wow!

MOM:
Harold, did you bring--

SON:
Oh no, Dad! Seto Kaiba! I forgot Seto Kaiba!

DAD:
Now, you know what I said, son. I asked if everyone was in. I asked if we had everything we needed because once we've gone down, we can't just pop back up.

SON:
But dad! Seto Kaiba Yu-Gi-Oh!

MOM:
Travis, you heard your father. We are not surfacing for your Yu-Gi-Oh action figure.

SON:
Moooooooom! Daaaaaaaaad!

Alright. We'll go back for Seto Kaiba, but that's it!

OK, out the hatch, mister, and you get right back!

Harold, I don't feel so well. I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to just dive and surface that quickly. The changes in pressure can --

Darling, none of us has eaten in the last hour, so we'll be fine.

SON:
Mom, are we going to be OK?

MOM:
I don't know, son.

SON:
Daddy, my tummy has a thousand boo-boos inside.

DAD:
Quiet, Travis. Daddy has a headache and his eyeballs are feeling a little fat and it makes it hard to concentrate.

Who wants that Puerto Rico Trench?

MOM:
Harold, did you bring the sandwiches?

Now surfacing for sandwiches!!

Daddy, I just threw up dark tomato sauce.

DAD:
That was your own blood, son.

MOM:
Harold, the last thing I will see before I die is my hands wrapped around your throat.

Shut up, you unadventurous harridan!

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
This is so weird!

[ They close the door ]

JOEL:
What were you saying, Courtney?

COURTNEY:
Every time one of us says.....the "D" word, someone rings the door bell.

CURTIS:
That makes so much sense!

JOEL:
Are you saying we can summon stuff, we can make things happen just by making noises?

COURTNEY:
Yes.

CURTIS:
Wow.

JOEL:
BOOM!

[ They all panic, running around screaming "Get Down!" "Take Cover!" They eventually calm down. ]

CURTIS:
Joel! Don’t do that!

JOEL:
Sorry. I just got excited.

COURTNEY:
Booooo, Joel.

[ They all freak out running around yelling that there’s a ghost. ]

JOEL:
Maybe that’s who’s been ringing the doorbell!

CURTIS:
A ghost?

COURTNEY:
That makes so much sense!

CURTIS:
No, Courtney, it really doesn’t. And here’s what I think of your ghost theory.

[ Makes fart sound with his mouth ]

COURTNEY and JOEL: [ holding their noses ]
EEEEWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
No, it’s just a sound I’m making with my mouth.

[ Makes the fart sound again ]

COURTNEY and JOEL:
EwWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
Guys, it’s not real. Watch. [ makes the fart sound again ]

[ COURTNEY stops holding her nose. ]

COURTNEY:
He’s right, Joel, it doesn’t stink.

JOEL:
I’m not taking that chance.

CURTIS:
Guys, we’re just falling victim to a stage convention.

COURTNEY:
A what?

CURTIS:
Sounds we make with our mouths are representations of real sounds when we want them to be.

JOEL:
Okay, then, Smarty Pants. How did you know I was at the door?

CURTIS:
You said “Ding dong”........

ZB1:
Hi. I'm Jimmy Zydeco, and this is my brother.

ZB2:
I'm Jimmy Zydeco.

ZB1:
We're the Zydeco brothers. Are you a Zydeco band in the north Austin area?

ZB2:
Have you noticed fewer and fewer people having a good time at your Zydeco concerts or zydeco related events?

ZB1:
We have a solution for you. You see, we love dancing to zydeco more than you enjoy writing and playing it, probably.

ZB2:
So, Jimmy, let's tell them our idea.

ZB1:
Good idea. We'll show them our idea. For five bucks we'll dance at your show.

ZB2
You'll see “The Bayou Bounce.”

[ They dance. ]

ZB 1
Another fiver will get you “The Creole Shuffle.”

[ They dance. ]

And for the band who spares no expense ...

ZB2
Twenty dollars gets you “The Ol' Lou-sana Whoop and Holler.”

[ They dance. ]

ZB1
So call today and we'll be dancing at your Zydeco concert, Mardi Gras party, Zydeco-themed birthday, wedding, bridal shower, retirement party, bar mitzvah, or other Zydeco-related personal or professional event tomorrow.

ZB2
Our number's right there, so give us a ring. Even if you just want to hang out.

ZB1
We're reasonably attractive men, and our curious attempt at life makes us kind of interesting.

ZB2
Hey! Yeah, I like us!

ZB1
Me too. We're not bad guys.

ZB2
I'm perfectly fine with who I am!

ZB1
See you at the show. Now let's get swampy!

[ MARTIN and CHARLES, two businessmen. Charles is the older of the two. They are seated at a table, drinking cocktails. ]

MARTIN
So I looked Jerry right in the face and I told him, "Listen, Jerry. It's not that I expect to make partner this year, or even next year. But I want to talk about what my future at the firm looks like."

CHARLES
Well, good for you.

MARTIN
I know how the game is played. No one gives it to you; you have to show that you're willing to step up and take it.

CHARLES
That's partly true, but don't push too hard. The old boys also want to see that you can be patient.

MARTIN
Charles, that might've worked for you, but it's a different story with me.

CHARLES
How's that?

MARTIN
I wasn't born with a lot of connections. I never went to any Ivy League yacht parties. They're not going to just hand it to me.

CHARLES
Like they handed it to me, you mean?

MARTIN
Aw, Charles, that's not what I meant--

CHARLES
Martin, you're a bright young attorney with a lot of talent. But you still don't know people all that well.

MARTIN
Charles--

CHARLES
Hold on. You think I never had to overcome anything?

MARTIN
I didn't--

CHARLES
Martin, let me tell you something. Something I've never told anyone before.

MARTIN
Charles, I don't want to make this some kind of big deal--

CHARLES
I'm a baby, Martin.

MARTIN
Pardon?

CHARLES
I suffer from a rare condition. From my outward appearance and composure, anyone would swear I'm a grown man. But technically, according to medical science, I am a baby.

MARTIN
I don't understand you.

CHARLES
Here.

[ He hands Martin his keys. ]

This might clarify things a bit. These are the keys to my Lexus. Now, shake them for me.

[ Beat. ]

Go ahead, just give them a bit of a jangle.

[ Martin shakes the keys a little bit. Charles laughs heartily, applauds. ]

Wonderful! A-ha! Smashing stuff, truly!

[ He takes his keys back. ]

See?

MARTIN
Charles, what are you trying to say? That you're actually under a year old?

CHARLES
Of course not. I'm fifty-seven years old. It's just that I'm a baby. According to medical science.

MARTIN
Says who?

CHARLES
Medical scientists!

MARTIN
Which medical scientists?

CHARLES
A team of the very best. They've been studying me since birth. I still visit them once a month for tests. It's our hope that rigorous study of my condition may eventually do humanity some good.

MARTIN
So you're fifty-seven years old.

CHARLES
That's correct.

MARTIN
And you look fifty-seven years old.

CHARLES
I can pass for forty-five in the right light.

MARTIN
And you think like one of the city's most successful intellectual property lawyers.

CHARLES
Well, you see, Martin, I have no understanding of language. I only mimic sounds that I hear in order to elicit positive responses. As for my job performance, think of it as just play at a very high level. Knocking the right shapes into the right holes, so to speak.

MARTIN
Because you're a baby.

CHARLES
Exactly, a baby.

[ Beat. ]

Try this. Put your hands over your face.

[ Beat. ]

Indulge me.

[ Martin does. Charles stands up and starts to look around. ]

Martin, where have you gone? Martin, come on now, we were right in the middle of a conversation!

[ Martin uncovers his face. Charles notices, chuckles, points. ]

Ah, there you are. Delightful!

[ Charles sits again. ]

MARTIN
So what is this? Some kind of prank? The old boys' way of hazing one of the young guys?

CHARLES
Martin, I'm a baby! Babies don't prank! For God's sake, I don't even have object permanence.

MARTIN
I don't appreciate this, whatever it is.

CHARLES
I don't know what you're talking about, Martin! I mean, I actually don't know what you're talking about or what any of the sounds you make really mean! Goo-goo ga-ga and all that, you know?

MARTIN
Goodbye, Charles.

CHARLES
Why are you getting angry? Your emotions are strange and troubling to me. Oooooh, now I feel myself becoming upset as well.

MARTIN
Goodbye, Charles.

[ He leaves. ]

CHARLES
Come back! I don't want you to leave! I want you to come back! This is not the way I want things to be!

[ Beat. Charles starts throwing a tantrum. ]

[ TWO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TAKING A BREAK. They are drinking liquor, soda, and lime juice separately. ]

ONE:
Finally, it's break time.

TWO:
Yes, we may now temporarily discontinue our labors and relax in the manner of our choosing.

ONE:
Tell me, when you're not working a rivet gun and securing girders what do you do?

TWO:
Well, when I'm not here performing my duties I am involved in any number of fun activities. You?

ONE:
I have ideas.

TWO:
You mean, you have thoughts? You have things occur to you that are original and unique and unique to the topic you're thinking about?

ONE:
Yeah, yeah ideas. I have ideas.

TWO:
Oh yeah? What kind of ideas?

ONE:
Okay. What if there was a guy who came to your house and took your trash away?

TWO:
You mean, one would say amass garbage in a bin or can of some kind. Once that's full, you'd say take outside? Out front of your home and leave it there? And then someone would just come by and dispose of it for you?

ONE:
Yeah, yeah, and they'd take it all to one place, everyone's trash would go to one place.

TWO:
So this person would pick up your trash, your neighbor's trash and take it somewhere and say dump it? In a designated dumping area?

ONE:
Yeah and they'd charge you to do this. And they'd also charge you to go to the place where you took your trash and then you could look through other people's trash.

TWO:
Hmmmm. You're right, that is an idea. Got any other ideas?

ONE:
Lemme see. What about if you notice the hair on your head is getting long you should be able to go somewhere and have someone do something about that.

TWO:
So you're saying my hair would grow to the point where I would be dissatisfied with the length or perhaps realize that it's out of style and I would go to a place dedicated to restyling and shortening hair?

ONE:
Yeah, that's right.

TWO:
No one is going to volunteer to style and cut other people's hair.

ONE:
Nonononononono, that's not what I mean at all! You misunderstand me. You would pay them in exchange for their services.

TWO:
Oh! Oh okay, now I see. And they've got all the instruments that they would need to perform this task right there with them. You don't have to bring anything, you don't need your own scissors or razor?

ONE:
No, they've got it all there.

TWO:
What about a brush or a comb.

ONE:
Nope, nope, they got it.

TWO:
I wouldn't want a brush or a comb run through my hair that had been run through someone else's.

ONE:
Oh, they would sterilize them between uses.

TWO:
Sounds like you got this all figured out.

ONE:
Like I said, I got ideas. Lots of ideas.

TWO:
Got any more?

ONE:
Yeah, yeah, I do.

TWO:
Hit me.

ONE:
Okay, say you're at home and you want a mixed drink or you just want someone to get a beer for you from the fridge.

TWO:
Sounds nice.

ONE:
Okay okay okay okay okay okay....say you go to a place where they will mix a drink for you, and others who might show up, or fetch a beer from the fridge for you.

TWO:
So you're saying I would say what I wanted say a mixture of some sort of liquor, liqueur, spirits and some sort of soda, a fizzy carbonated beverage. And say I'd say "Say, could you mix me up a little bit of X and a little bit of Y and throw in a dash of Z while you're at it and then maybe one of those things cause it's just that kind of night." And then this person would say tend to this request.

ONE:
Right right.

TWO:
And maybe there'd be some sort of common lexicon, something, I don't know, like names for the combinations so I wouldn't have to list every ingredient every time.

ONE:
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, that's right, yeah.

TWO:
And the person taking my order would know the ingredients that are in that type of drink. Maybe there are schools or training available to teach such things.

ONE:
Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.

TWO:
And then if you're not feeling like having a liquor or a liqueur or a spirit, maybe I just say give me one of those brewed beverages you have in that fridge over there.

ONE:
That's the idea.

TWO:
But how could they afford to give out drinks? I mean when I stock my liquor cabinet or buy beer for my fridge, it's not free.

ONE:
Well, I mean, you'd pay them for the drinks and you'd also pay them for the energy they expended preparing or fetching that drink for you.

TWO:
You got this all figured out.

ONE:
I got more I got more.

TWO:
Okay, one more.

ONE:
What about people who sit and brainstorm together or maybe separately, and come up with ideas for occupations, jobs, things people can do to make other peoples' lives simpler.

TWO:
So a couple people who just sit around, kind of bounce ideas off each other. Say, one person would present an idea or thought and the other might expand on it? Say, flesh it out?

ONE:
Right right, yeah like that.

TWO:
That sounds kinda boring. Who would want to do that?

ONE:
I don't know. I just don't know.

It has storage, and it can hold very many books. It doesn’t need wireless hotspot. It connects to a 3G network.

MARIA
Like my cellular phone?

FELIPE
Yes, Maria, like your cellular phone.

MARIA
What are you reading right now, Felipe?

FELIPE
The new Jonathan Franzen novel.

MARIA
Do you like this novel, Felipe?

FELIPE
Between the rapturous early reviews and the subsequent backlash, Maria, I am having trouble seeing the book for itself.

MARIA
I am very surprised that you have a Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
Do not be caught off-guard and speechless, Maria, like anti-immigration Arizona governor Jan Brewer famously was in a recent interview.

MARIA
This reference is lost on me, Felipe. I do not yet watch American television, though I hope to soon.

FELIPE
Can you imagine, Maria, Arizona governor Jan Brewer trying to answer questions on a contemporary American game show?

[ He mugs to the audience. ]

MARIA
I cannot, for the reason I just stated.

FELIPE
Yes.

MARIA
So, your Kindle, Felipe.

FELIPE
It is not a big deal, really!

MARIA
Had someone asked this morning, “Maria, the boy Felipe, the one you are running to America with, does he have a Kindle?”, I would have said no. Ay, poor fool Maria.

FELIPE
Maria...

MARIA
Perhaps I shall not dream of my new life in America. I shall dream of a life where Felipe confided to poor Maria that he had a Kindle.

FELIPE
Silencio! Silencio!

[ The huddle together. Felipe whispers. ]

I just wanted you to stop talking for a moment.

MARIA
Bastardo! Give me your Kindle!

FELIPE
Never!

[ They struggle over it. A voice calls from offstage. ]

VOICE
Drop that e-reader and scatter, you beautiful would-be Americans!

[ PATRIOTIC MUSIC. ]

[ Startled, they get up. ]

FELIPE
Dios mio! Maria! Run! It’s Glen Rockley!

MARIA
I have not heard of this man, Felipe.

FELIPE
He is a composite character created for satire.

MARIA
No! NO!!!

[ They run, EXITING the stage. (They leave the Kindle.) ]

[ Glen Rockley ENTERS. ]

[ As he delivers his pitch to the audience, he moves back and forth across the stage. Perhaps he has a series of patriotic props: a rifle, a cowboy hat, etc. ]

GLEN
I’m Glen Rockley, and I’ve got a message for Arizona. So clean the crap out of your ears and pay attention!

America is facing a crisis along its borders. And Arizona is on the front lines!

Did you know that Latin-American women are renowned throughout the world for their natural curves and earthy sensuality?

Did you know that Latin men are just as renowned for their passionate lovemaking and their strong facial features?

I’ll bet you didn’t!

Uncontrolled immigration from countries like Mexico threaten our uniquely American appreciation of physical beauty.

I’m Glen Rockley, and in my life I’ve been everything from a Sears assistant floor manager to a Sears floor manager to, at one point, a baby. So you better believe it when I say I know a thing or two about a thing or two.

Did you know that more and more Americans are being aroused by immigrants every year? And that at least half of the immigrants causing this arousal are here illegally?

I bet you didn’t, you fucking idiot!

Sorry, I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at the situation!

Fewer and fewer Americans are becoming aroused by natural-born American citizens. Our ability to produce erections domestically is being threatened.

Did you know that, proportional to their percentage of the population, Mexican men and women are responsible for a greatly disproportionate amount of America’s stiff, juicy boners and moist, receptive ladyboners?

I personally have been affected by these boners, because I’ve had them!

And after I masturbate, I am furious! Furious!

And the devastating physical beauty of these illegal immigrants is matched only by the beauty and vibrancy of their culture!

Do you know how many colors are represented in an average dia de los muertos festival?

Aren’t you tired of shedding tears over the plaintive beauty of Chicano poetry?

Aren’t you tired of norteno music dominating America’s Top 40 charts?

Well, I am!

[ He picks up the Kindle. ]

And as soon as I’m done re-reading Fuentes’s The Death of Artemio Cruz, I intend to do something about it!

I’m a single, childless man in my early fifties with free time and disposable income!

Maybe I’ll run for office, or something!

Maybe I’ll start a blog!

Maybe one of these days I’ll film one of the these rants and run it on TV, like as an advertisement!

[ Pause. He is out of wind. He takes several deep breaths, EXITS. ]

TRACY:
Well, Bradley, you are welcome anytime.

BRADLEY:
Thank you, Tracy.

TRACY:
Besides, having you over is a nice change of pace. Usually it's just me and Mark, and that gets pretty boring.

MARK:
Now who's being awful?

TRACY:
I am.

TRACY:

MARK:

TRACY:

[ They all go limp as if being released from a painful grip. ]

TRACY:
What was that?

BRADLEY:
I don't know.

MARK:
It must be some kind of glitch in time.

BRADLEY:

MARK:
Exactly.

TRACY:
That's stupid.

MARK:

BRADLEY:
Just kidding.

MARK and TRACY:

Hello everyone. Thank you for coming out to the show tonight.

COURTNEY
We are very excited to share some new sketches with you guys.

JOEL
So let’s go ahead and get started.

[ Curtis and Courtney snicker. ]

OK. Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. I’d like to make an offer on your house.

[ Curtis and Courtney fail to contain their laughter. ]

My name is Joel.

[ Curtis and Courtney double over with laughter. ]

I’d really like you to hear my offer.

[ They laugh harder. ]

I think you’re going to want to hear my - all right! What’s so funny?!

COURTNEY
Oh come one, Joel.

JOEL
What?

CURTIS
Joel.

JOEL
What.

COURTNEY
You know.

JOEL
No.

CURTIS
It’s the reason we think you’re funny.

JOEL
What are you talking about?

[ Curtis and Courtney laugh again. ]

Seriously, what are you guys talking about?

CURTIS [ while laughing ]
Oh God, you’re killing me.

COURTNEY
Joel, it’s the only reason we let you stay in the group.

JOEL
What is?

CURTIS [ suddenly serious ]
Your voice, Joel.

COURTNEY [ imitates Joel’s “voice” ]
I’m Joel. I’m Joel. I’m Joel.

JOEL
I don’t sound like that.

CURTIS [ angry ]
That’s exactly what you sound like!

JOEL
I don’t sound like that.

COURTNEY [ angrier ]
Yes you do, Joel!

CURTIS [ still angry ]
Hear for yourself!

[ Curtis pulls his phone from his pocket, pushes a button, and puts it in front of Joel’s mouth. ]

Say something.

[ Pause ]

Anything.

JOEL
I’m Joel.

[ Curtis rewinds and plays the recording. ]

COURTNEY
This is gonna be great.

[ The recording plays “Say something. Anything” and “I’m Joel,” in a funny voice. ]

[ Linda seated in a living room.  Joseph, her husband, enters. ]

Joseph:
Linda, I’m home.

LINDA:
How was your day?

Joseph:
Fine. Yours?

LINDA:
Good. Did you mail that letter?

JOSEPH:
I forgot. I’m sorry.

LINDA:
Joseph, that’s a very important letter. It explains to the electric company why our payment was late last week.

JOSEPH:
I know, Linda. I’ve just been so distracted lately.

LINDA:
What’s going on? You want to talk about it? Maybe we can talk about how it affects your ability to mail a letter.

JOSEPH:
Will you get off my back about the letter?!

LINDA:
Well what’s so distracting, Joseph?!

Joseph:
It’s these damn hands! They’re a curse! Cut these tools of the devil from my arms this instant!

[ Joseph kneels and holds up his hands to Linda. Linda yawns and sits on the couch. ]

LINDA:
Joseph, I’m not cutting off your hands? (GASP) You’re having an affair.

Joseph:
No. It’s something much worse.

LINDA:
I’ll cut off your hands if you’ve been having an affair, I guess. But I won’t use the good cutlery. I’ll use that old rusted pizza cutter you insist on keeping around. Then you’ll get tetanus and then you’ll get lock jaw and then you’ll starve to death. Now that’s fitting for a philanderer.

Joseph:
Linda, I’m not having an affair.

LINDA:
Then why are you being so dramatic?

Joseph:
I killed a man.

LINDA:
You killed a man?

Joseph:
I killed a man.

LINDA:
Tonight?

Joseph:
A year ago tonight.

LINDA:
Why on earth would you do something like that? You’re going to lose your job.

Joseph:
It was an accident.

LINDA:
Joseph?

JOSEPH:
Yes, Linda?

LINDA:
Are you going to kill me next?

JOSEPH:
What? No!

LINDA:
Well I can’t say it wouldn’t be a total surprise.

Joseph:
I’d never hurt you, Linda. I love you. The murder was an accident. It happened, last year, at the Stop ‘n Shop ‘n  Pay ‘n Save.

LINDA:
Oh my lord, you’re the Stop ‘n Shop ‘n Pay ‘n Save Strangler.

Joseph:
It’s true. It’s all true.

LINDA:
What happened that night?

Joseph:
I was walking up to the store

[ Joseph begins to pace. ]

and I reached my arms up to open the doors - you know how I like to reach for things.

[ Linda begins walking toward Joseph when his back is turned ]

Suddenly the doors flew open. My hands didn’t meet the cold metal of store front door, but the warm flesh of a human throat and then I unintentionally strangled a man.

[ At this moment Joseph turns with his hands reaching out and accidentally grabs Linda by the throat. He strangles her. ]

Joseph:
Oh no, I’m doing it now. I swear I’m not doing this on purpose. It was an accident. This is an accident. I don’t want to do this. I don’t mean it.

[ Linda slowly crumbles to the floor. Joseph goes down with her. He releases his grip once she is motionless. He slowly reaches his hands around his own throat. He begins to cough and gasp. He releases his grip. ]

Joseph:
Man, that smarts.

CEO
Well, lookie here, a couple of real bigshots.

EXEC 2

CEO

CEO
Hey, dive away, Greg Louganis.

EXEC 1
Sir, we’ve been reviewing the firm’s finances.

CEO
Well, Gene Shalit, I hope it’s a good review.

EXEC 2
Uh, yes sir.

CEO
Look at Mr. and Mrs. Vice President of Finance, here.

EXEC 1
I’m VP of Finance, sir.

EXEC 2

CEO
Well, ain’t this just a pretty little financial strategy session.

That is what we were hoping to meet about, sir.

CEO
Sure thing, Johnny Correctly.

EXEC 2
Sir, our stock price is tumbling.

CEO
Well, pleased to meet you, Mr. Dow, Mrs. Jones, of the firm Industrial & Average.

EXEC 1

CEO
Emphasis on average.

[ The CEO pulls out a yogurt cup and a plastic spoon. He starts eating the yogurt. ]

EXEC 2
Sir, with the stockholder’s meeting coming up next month, we think it’s really important that--

CEO
Hold the phone. I’ve got to call my buddies back at the frat house, because here I am speaking to real live calendar girl.

[ The CEO starts gnawing on the spoon. ]

EXEC 1
Sir, you really shouldn’t eat that plastic spoon.

CEO
Well, listen to Captain Nutrition over here.

Huh.

So you know about the two way mirror thing?

D2:
I know about the two way mirror in the interrogation room, yes.

[ A VENDOR. He has a small crate of oranges. A sign: “Farm Fresh Oranges for Sale”. The vendor is setting up a second sign, which shows an arrow pointing to the vendor: “Want to buy an orange to eat? Talk to this man.” He is wearing pajama pants, flip flops, and a Mr. & Mrs. Smith shirt. He reaches over to the oranges, hesitates.  ]

VENDOR
Today’s the big day, guys. Today’s the day.

[ He sits. ]

VENDOR [ yelling ]
Farm fresh oranges!! Get your farm fresh oranges! If you like farm fresh oranges, I got ‘em! Get them from me! Buy some farm fresh oranges!

[ A WOMAN ENTERS. ]

VENDOR
Farm fre--

[ The vendor stops in mid-sentence, tries to look inconspicuous. ]

WOMAN
Selling oranges?

VENDOR
Yes -- no -- maybe -- whatever -- why? -- what do you want?

[ He tries to fold the sign over hurriedly. ]

WOMAN
I’d like to buy an orange or two.

VENDOR
Okay, so what do I care?

WOMAN
It says that you’re selling oranges.

VENDOR
No.

WOMAN
The sign.

[ She points at it. ]

VENDOR
It’s an old sign. So, like, if you like reading old signs, read it again, what do I care?

WOMAN
OK, well, fuck you.

VENDOR
No!

[ She starts to leave. ]

VENDOR
Ma’am, ma’am. Just kidding. It’s a joke. I’m selling oranges.

[ The woman looks at him, narrow-eyed. ]

VENDOR
It’s a joke I have with my friends.

[ He starts laughing. She starts laughing. ]

WOMAN
So how much are the oranges?

[ He stops. He gestures for her to come over. She leans in, bends her ear. ]

VENDOR
I’m not selling oranges!! 
WOMAN
Fuck you!

[ She punches him in the chest. Vendor is alarmed. ]

VENDOR
Wait wait. Reboot. Let’s reboot. Let’s start this over. Look. I’m selling oranges. It’s true. But these oranges are really special to me. They’re fresh from the farm. Not just anybody deserves these oranges, OK? OK?

[ She looks at him skeptically. ]

WOMAN
These are good oranges?

VENDOR
These are the best oranges I’ve ever tasted, and seriously, I’m not saying that becuase I grew them on my orange farm. I’m not saying that because I plucked them off my orange bush with my own two hands.

WOMAN
Oranges grow on bushes?

VENDOR
They grow on ... a plant. It’s immaterial. The point is, when I first tasted one of these oranges, I felt like my taste buds had called me up for an all-night hardcore fuckfest in my mouth. Pardon my French. I tried to kill myself.

WOMAN
Why?

VENDOR
Because what’s the point? Look at me. I never dress like this. Never. But now, after this orange, what’s the point?

WOMAN
How much are they?

VENDOR
Three for two ... I mean, one hundred dollars apiece.

WOMAN
That’s insane. There’s a guy a mile down who sells them for four bucks a pound.

VENDOR
That’s a fair price for an orange that’s got crap in it.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
He craps in his oranges.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
He craps in his oranges.

WOMAN
What?

VENDOR
I’ve reported it several times.

WOMAN
He does not crap in his oranges.

VENDOR
He might as well.

WOMAN
What does that mean?

VENDOR
His oranges taste like crap. Like a big crap.

WOMAN
OK. Well, look, it’s been a few minutes already, and it kind of feels like a lot longer than that--

VENDOR
Time flies when you’re having fun.

WOMAN
Right, that’s the opposite. So let’s just get this clear: Is there any way on earth I’ll be leaving this interaction with some oranges?

[ Pause. ]

VENDOR
Probably not.

WOMAN
OK, well. I wish I could say this has been fun. Good luck to you, I guess?

VENDOR
Thanks, I really don’t make it that far with most people.

[ She leaves. He sits. ]

VENDOR
Good luck ... to me!

[ He looks at his oranges. ]

VENDOR
It’s gonna happen today, fellas. We’re really gonna make it happen.

[ He calls out again. ]

VENDOR
Oranges! Oranges fresh from a farm! Naranjas frescas!

[ A middle aged married couple is in their New Jersey living room. Trash is scattered on the floor. We join them mid-squabble. They are obviously upset with each other. The following should be delivered sarcastically. ]

WIFE:
You know what, Craig? You’re doing a great job of making an ass of yourself.

HUSBAND:
A great job, huh?

WIFE:
A helluva job!

HUSBAND:
I’m doing a bang up job, huh?

WIFE:
Oh yeah. The amount of effort you are putting into your work nowadays is very clear.

HUSBAND:
Look at me I’m finally good at one of my jobs I’ve had.

WIFE:
And you are great at this one!

HUSBAND:
You mean being an ass!

WIFE:
You said it. A big ass.

HUSBAND:
I’m so very pleased with myself.

WIFE:
Well, you should be.

HUSBAND:
I feel so accomplished.

WIFE:
Great job, Craig!

HUSBAND:
Why thank you very much!

WIFE:
And you have been at it for a very long time.

HUSBAND:
Then it won’t come as a surprise to hear that I am demanding a raise.

WIFE:
You’re not getting a raise.

HUSBAND:
No?

WIFE:
No.

HUSBAND:
No?

WIFE:
No!

HUSBAND:
But, I have worked so long and so hard at being an ass all this time.

WIFE:
Which is why I am giving you a promotion.

HUSBAND:
Finally, a corner office!

WIFE:
And a raise!

HUSBAND:
Suddenly things are looking up for ol’ Craig.

WIFE:
Looks like you’re hittin’ it big this time!

HUSBAND:
Things are really goin’ for me now, baby!

WIFE:
Hope you don’t forget us little folks down here while you’re assin’ it up with the big brass!

HUSBAND:
Assin’ it up?

WIFE:
Assin’ it all up until you forgot where you came from.

HUSBAND:
Oh, perish the thought. How could I possibly forget people like you who have served as so much inspiration?!

WIFE:
I speak, if I may, on behalf of those so honored to have inspired such a great mind as yourself...

HUSBAND:
You may.

WIFE:
...when I say what a privilege it has been to be a part of something so much bigger than all of us.

HUSBAND:
You are too, kind.

WIFE:
Kind to a fault one might say.

HUSBAND:
One might, yes.

WIFE:
Craig?

HUSBAND:
What?!

WIFE:
Just take out the trash, Craig.

HUSBAND:
OK.

GUY:
I'll paint the scene for you. 1:40 AM, a night on the town, alone. It's one of those days you keep giving another chance, even though it hasn't earned it. I'm halfway into a glass of straight whiskey and I'm picking up the pace so I can order one more before last call. And then ... this woman.

You know the type. Giant forehead, heart of stone. The kind of woman who'll make you do her laundry but won't give you the last stick of gum. Thighs up to here.

[ He indicates his neck. ]

Shoulders down to here.

[ He indicates midway down his torso. ]

And elbows somewhere over there.

[ He points some distance away. ]

Might as well be in another county. Two good legs with feet right at the end, but they ain't for walking, you know? Unless it's walking all over you.

The most transparent skin you've ever seen. You could watch the heart beating right in this broad's chest and see the blood rushing to every organ, like poor slobs off to work in their little red cars. You get to work, little blood cells. Get all the way up those thighs and down those shoulders.

There's frogs and fish with skin like that. Then there was this dame, who had them all beat.

She was bad news; I could smell it on her. Bad news in new shoes. Giant foreheard, heart of stone -- just like mama taught me.

WOMAN: [ continues facing back ]
Aren't you coming to bed? My forehead's getting cold.

Believe me, if you saw this forehead, you wouldn't blame me.

WOMAN
Can I borrow your pencil?

You’re always working so hard. You shouldn’t work so hard.

Dude, you ever 69 with a chick?

I loooove doing 69 with chicks.

How many chicks have you 69’ed with?

Probably a few, I bet.

You ever get hit with a shit sock?

Naw?

It’s not cool. Not like 69’ing.

I love to 69, man.

You know, work can be so frustrating.

And I’ve got a lot of regrets in my life, you know. Things I never did that I wanted to.

A lot of people use alcohol to cope.

Not me, man.

I use 69, man.

I love it so much.

You’ve done it, right? Of course you have.

One time I tried 69’ing with two chicks at once.

It didn’t work!

A lot of guys want to be with two chicks at once. Not me, man. Can’t 69.

Plus, that was the time I got hit with the shit sock.

I married one of those girls.

But it didn’t work out.

You never get that trust back, once a girl hits you with a shit sock.

No matter how many times you 69.

You married, man?

I’ve only got one piece of advice. 69 her. 69 her all the time.

I’m working on a book, you know.

It’s for married couples. It’s called The 69 Steps to A Successful Marriage.

It’s about 69-ing within the context of a committed, monogamous relationship.

The first step is to 69, as often as possible.

I just need to come up with 68 more steps.

I’m debating whether step two should be “never hit each other with a shit sock.”

Man, I really admire your work ethic.

You are a really hard worker.

I’d like to see how a guy like you 69s.

I bet you 69 really hard, so that the chick is like “wow.”

Like, “wow, this is the best 69 ever.”

Would you agree to be interviewed for my book?

I could really use your input.

Maybe even get you a co-author credit. We could do this together.

I think a guy like you might have some really valuable insights about 69.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Have you ever 69’ed with a girl?

[ Long, long pause. ]

MANNY
Yes I have.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Why did you take so long to answer?

I did get hit with a shit sock, though.

I don't know. It's really weird.

Guys, I think I know what's going on. Everytime someone says "ding dong"....

CURTIS:
This is so weird!

JOEL:
What were you saying, Courtney?

COURTNEY:
Every time one of us says.....the "D" word, someone rings the door bell.

WAITER
Hey there.

PATRON
What WAS that?

What?

PATRON
What was THAT?

WAITER
My name is Ken, sir. I’ll be your waiter this evening. Can I start you off with a beverage?

PATRON
Water. I drink water.

WAITER
Yes sir.

WAITER
Hey there.

PATRON
What the hell -

WAITER
What did you order to drink, sir?

PATRON

WAITER
Your beverage sir. I forgot your order.

PATRON
I ordered wa -

HEY!

[ The manager enters. ]

MANAGER
Is there a problem here? I heard yelling.

PATRON
He’s touchin’ my face with stuff. I don’t like it.

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
Is this true?

WAITER
Yes.

MANAGER [ to patron ]
Did you ask him to stop?

PATRON
YES!

WAITER
No he didn’t.

MANAGER [ to patron ]
Is this true?

PATRON
Yes.

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
Please stop touching his face.

PATRON
He was touchin’ my face!

MANAGER
I know, sir.

PATRON
With some cardboard tubes!

MANAGER
I am so sorry, sir. I see that you are without a drink. May we serve you a beverage?

PATRON
I drink water!

[ The manager gestures to the waiter who immediateley exits. ]

MANAGER
Of course, your bill will be taken care of by the restaurant.

PATRON
That’s what I expect for him touchin’ my face with that tubin’.

MANAGER
Is there anything else I can do to make your meal more enjoyable?

PATRON
I wanna read this book.

MANAGER
Very good, sir. I will leave you to it.

PATRON
He’s touchin’ my face again! You asked him not to and he still touched my face.

[ The manager enters. ]

MANAGER
Was he doing it again?

PATRON
Yes.

MANAGER
Did he do it like this?

[ Manager produces a tube and pokes the patron’s face. ]

Or was it more like this?

[ Manager picks up the very long tube and pokes it offstage, opposite the patron. The tube appears behind the patron and pokes him in the back of the head. The poking continues. ]

PATRON
Hey! Stop it! You guys are annoying.

MANAGER
Well, this is who we are.

WAITER
And we can’t help it. And here’s you’re water.

PATRON
This glass is empty.

MANAGER
I hope that’s not annoying you.

WAITER
Here’s your bill.

PATRON
But I didn’t even have anything.

MANAGER
You should leave now.

WAITER
He didn’t even leave a tip.

MANAGER
No, but I can do this.

You’re a bad waiter and everyone thinks you stink.

WAITER
Hey!

COURTNEY
Whew. That was a good scene. Now folks, this next part is really exciting. Using state of the art technology, we’re going to to watch what we just taped...

CURTIS
What? Nothing.

Oh, oh, oh no oh the humanity.

We’re gonna have to do a citizen’s arrest.

COURTNEY and JOEL
Citizen’s arrest! Citizen’s arrest!

COURTNEY [to audience ]
Ladies and gentlemen. Let me welcome you to Your Terrific Neighbors court of the people where justice is a fickle tart who eats all your pudding and leaves you with a serious case of the willies.

JOEL [to audience ]
Please fan yourselves with your programs during this portion of the show because we want it to look like we’re in a real Southern courtroom.

[to Courtney ]

Okay, I wanna be judge.

COURTNEY
I wanna be judge. I’m the judgiest.

JOEL
You certainly are judgemental.

[They both take the rock, paper, scissors stance. Joel lands on rock and Courtney does “the rooster”. ]

COURTNEY
I win.

JOEL
What was that?

COURTNEY
Rooster. I win. Cock beats rock.

JOEL
How do you figure?

COURTNEY
Cock pecks rock. Sock beats cock because sock covers cock. Rock beats sock because rock tears a hole in the sock. Those are the rules of Cock, Rock, Sock.

JOEL
Oh yeah. Okay. I’m defense attorney. You’re prosecution. Oh! And I’m the typy lady!

COURTNEY
Stenographer? Okay.

JOEL
Gesundheit.

[COURTNEY and JOEL set up the “court”: judge has a podium with a gavel, signs on tables denote where the defense and prosecution are sitting and a cardboard box says “jury box” then rush out and bring CURTIS back in, who is wearing rudimentary shackles now CURTIS is on defendant side. JOEL, as the plaintiff, is fanning himself with a fancy fan. ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
In the case of Courtney and Joel v. Curtis. Curtis, you are charged with the brutal slaying of Courtney and Joel. How do you plead?

CURTIS
Not guilty!

COURTNEY [as judge ]
You’ve been charged with a very serious crime, son. Do you understand the charges brought against you?

CURTIS
Yes your honor. No your honor. Not really your honor!

COURTNEY [as judge ]
Are you getting this, missy?

JOEL [as stenographer ]
Yessir, yessir, every word!

CURTIS
I mean, they’re sitting right there! I can’t have murdered them.

COURTNEY [ as judge ]
Be that as it may, we have video proof to the contrary, son, that is admissible as evidence.

JOEL [as plaintiff ]
We saw it with our own eyes. We saw you murder us!

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
The course of my clients lives have been altered forever. Seeing themselves murdered has deeply scarred them emotionally, not to mention the fact that they’ve been murdered!

JOEL [as plaintiff ]
Yeah! You deserve to die and I hope you burn in hell, you sick fucker! You are sick and you sicken me!

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
Your honor, I move to have that outburst stricken from the record.

COURTNEY [as Judge ]
Motion carries.

JOEL [as stenographer while crossing out words with a pen ]
The language, the language, disgusting.

JOEL [as defending attorney ]
My client cannot have killed these two currently living and breathing funny people. He simply cannot have as he was sitting in a theater watching sketch comedy at the time!

CURTIS
That doesn’t even make any sense! Why are you defending me? This doesn’t make any sense.....

COURTNEY [as prosecuting attorney ]
The defendant's case rests solely on the story “making sense” as if that means anything!

JOEL [as plaintiff ]
Yeah!

JOEL [as prosecuting attorney ]
“Making sense” makes perfect sense! Dollars and cents, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, DOLLARS AND SENSE!

[COURTNEY and JOEL sit in the jurors box and cheer loudly ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
Order! Order! ORDER!

[ Everyone is quiet. ]

Son, it seems plainly evident that you express no regret for your actions. These two comedians had a bright future ahead of them that you have terminated. Think of all the sketches we will never see because you have snuffed out their lives.

[JOEL is crying. ]

COURTNEY [as judge ]
I have no choice, son, but to sentence you to life in prison.

CURTIS
Why do you have even have a jury if you’re going to make the decision yourself?

COURTNEY [as judge ]
May God have mercy on your soul. You’ll be eligible for parole in 90 days.

[COURTNEY slams the gavel. COURTNEY and JOEL run around to their various positions and react in ways appropriat to that charater. COURTNEY and JOEL then become the bailiff and take CURTIS away. ]

CURTIS
No! No! NO!!!

[COURTNEY and JOEL return to the stage alone. ]

JOEL
I miss Curtis.

COURTNEY
Yeah, me, too.

JOEL
You be Curtis.

COURTNEY
No, you be Curtis!

[COURTNEY and JOEL get into rock, paper, scissors pose. COURTNEY does rock and JOEL does cock ]

JOEL
Cock beats rock! I win! You have to be Curtis!

COURTNEY
Aww, man!

JOEL
Now you get to clean up because Curtis always cleans up.

COURTNEY
Damn!

[COURTNEY begins to clean up the stage. Joel eats a jelly doughnut so the jelly and the powder gets everywhere ]

JOEL [mouth full of doughnut ]
What’s the sign for sock?

COURTNEY
Hmmm?

JOEL
It’s rock, cock, sock, right? What’s the hand sign for sock?

COURTNEY
Hmmmmm....I don’t know. I’ve only ever seen anyone do rock and cock. I guess that’s all you need.

JOEL
I thought love was all you need.

COURTNEY
No, love means never having to say you’re sorry.

JOEL
I never have to say I’m sorry. I’m Joel.

COURTNEY [ Mocks Joel. ]
I’m Joel. I’m Joel.

Brad:
Why don't I get you some--

LISA:
No here it comes here it comes!

[ She starts heaving, turning her face toward Brad's. ]

BRAD:
Wait, no not this way! Not this way!!

Lisa:

Brad:
Would you like some water?

Lisa:
No! You have to stay! You have to stay out here with me in case I die.

Brad:
You're not gonna die.

Lisa:
Your mom's not gonna die, so you can shut it all up.

[ Beat. ]

Brad:
Honey, I'm gonna see this through with you, but I need you to not point your face at me.

Lisa:
What are you even talking about?

Brad:
I know it's hard right now, but I need you to focus on this one thing. Just one thing. You've got to point your face at the ground if you're gonna be sick.

Lisa:
I am pointing at the ground. God you are such a liar.

Brad:
OK, honey, just keep it there--

Lisa:
Oh Jesus here comes the train!

Brad:
The ground, honey, please, the ground!

Lisa:
My stomach is such a liar.

Brad:
Do you want to move to the bathroom?

Lisa:
Why? Do you want to poop?

Brad:
No, I just think--

Lisa:
All you do is poop all day. You're selfish. You have to stay with me! You promised to stay!

Brad:
OK, but you have to promise me that you won't point your face at me if you're gonna--

Lisa:
You keep making sound. I'm attracted to the vibrations.

[ Beat. Brad begins to say something, but thinks better of it. ]

Like a sandworm.

[ Beat. ]

Brad:
What?

Lisa:
A sandworm. Like in the movie.

[ Beat. ]

Brad:
Dune?

Lisa:
No!

Brad:
Tremors?

Lisa:
No!

BRAD:
Beetlejuice?

Lisa:
No! Dune.

Brad:
All right.

LISA:
Noises made sandworms come.

Brad:
Yes.

LISA:
That movie was ridiculous. What was that movie even about?

Brad:
You have to know the book, I think.

Lisa:
That fat guy flies around and there's all this fighting and you don't know why and there's that guy from Star Trek.

Brad:
Well, it's a lot to cram into one movie, and--

Lisa:
Wormsign! Wormsign!

[ Again, she starts heaving in Brad's direction while he cowers. ]

Brad:
Honey, the ground! The ground!!

[ She puts her head back in her hands. ]

Lisa:
I don' wanna talk about Dune no more.

[ Beat. ]

Brad, you love me, right?

Brad:
Of course I do.

Lisa:
Even though I did too many shots?

Brad:
Even though you did too many shots.

Lisa:
Even though I'm gonna puke chicken curry on your face?

[ Beat. ]

I'm jus' makin' a joke you big stupid liar.

[ Beat. ]

Brad:
Even if you puked on my face, I would still love you.

[ Beat. ]

Lisa:
Good.

[ Beat. ]

Cuz iss prolly gonna happen.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

Two people, seated next to each other at a table, eating

1
I don’t know, I just thought if I brought it up at the meeting, Sarah would make a bigger deal out of it in public, would be on my side in front of everyone else. And she just left me hanging.

2
Yeah, but you kind of hounded the issue, like you had an axe to grind, and it was kind of embarrassing.

1
I know…

2
Like I’ve said before, I think she’d be more quick to address your concerns as your boss if you brought these things up to her in the moment when they’re relevant, ya know. Face the moment head-on, don’t bury it down deep to bring it up later, just let her know you have an issue with Kirk when Kirk does something you don’t like, and…

Another person enters wearing a weird robe and stands awkwardly next to the table

3
Welcome.

1
Um, hi.

2
Hello. So anyway, if you just connected more with the moment, overcome your fears, like say--

3
Have you been here before?

2
Yeah, we’ve been here for about 10 minutes, thank you.

1
We don’t have any change, sorry.

3
Please, come this way.

1
I’m sorry, who are you?

2
Look, don’t engage them. What were you saying?

3
Come with me to feast on new delights.

2
I’m sorry--what??

3
Come with me. Now. And revel in the culinary garden that awaits you.

2
Look, we’re all set. We’re about halfway done with these falafel wraps. Maybe another time.

3
Come.

1
Hey wait a sec. Maybe this is an opportunity!

2
Oh come on.

1
No yeah--an opportunity to face the moment head-on, overcome my dumb neuroses and say whether or not I’m ok with a thing as it comes to me.

3
Listen to your wise friend.

2
No look, I meant it more as a guideline in the workplace, not--

3
New pleasures for your hungry mouths.

2
We’re not really hungry right now. Falafel! Remember?

1
Ya know what? I’m going. I wanna see what new pleasures await.

2
[to self] So misguided. It’s like k-cup hot chocolates all over again.

1
Show me the way.

3
Come.

3 leads 1 to another area of the stage. 2 begrudgingly follows.

3
Here.

1
Here!

2
What’s this now?

3
Welcome to the newest dinner experience, “Kzzfwylgh”

2
Excuse me?

3
Welcome to the newest dinner experience, “Kzzfwylgh”

1
Kzzfwylgh!

2
It’s lunchtime though.

3
It’s dinner now. It’s always dinner here. Kzzfwylgh.

1
Oh I love it!

2
Hang on--are you pitching a restaurant to us on our lunch break?

3
There is no pitch. You are already here.

1
Hmmm, okay--I’m already here, it’s dinner already, but it’s lunchtime, and I’m almost done with my falafel wrap and break’s almost over. I’m not sure how I feel about this now…

2
Yeah, wait a second. This is a food court and it’s lunch, and you just waltz in here and declare that it’s another time and the site of single restaurant? Not on board, I’m out. [starts to leave]

3
[grabbing 2] But please, stay. Would you like to order a menu?

2
Oh for the love of

1
Wait now this does sound like something I might be into. New dining experiences...ordering a menu.. AND I’ve already eaten half my meal--it’s so deliciously confusing that I’m intrigued!

2
This is garbage.

3
The garbage menu, excellent choice.

1
Oooh make that two!

2
Good christ.

3
[handing menus] Here you are. Two garbage menus. Now please order rapidly.

1
Leftover salad!

2
Really couldn’t be less interested.

3
You have lost.

2
Oh my god. What?

3
You will not be asked back. And you [to 1] have acted admirably. Please join us again. In the future!

1
Oh yessssssss!!!!!

3
Kzzfwylgh.

2
Oh just shutup--

3
Goodbye [exits]

2 stares at 1 as 1 gloats to self

2
Well???

1
Yesss!!!!!! Oh wait--what? What do you mean?

2
What the hell was that???

1
Oh Kzzfwylgh.

2
Yes I know but--

1
Kzzfwylgh. Would have told you at the beginning but it’s just all coming back to me now.

2
Wait you knew about all this??

1
Yeahhhhh, but it’s been a couple of months since I made reservations.

2
YOU MADE….?? WHAT??

1
Yeah, it’s this new restaurant. You make reservations, they come to you, give you some portion of the dining experience, whether you’re ready or not. Very high concept, very chic. It’s kinda like that Michael Douglas movie The Game, but for hipster restaurants.

2
GOD DAMMIT!

1
Yeah, really thought I mentioned it to you. Couple of months back, I thought it might help me with my spontaneity. Then I totally forgot about it.

2
[sighs] Well I’m at least gonna finish my falafel wrap. Sitting down. Over there. Not as part of some dumb concept restaurant experience.

1
Suit yourself!

[1 and 2 eat wraps in respective areas]

2
You’re still a shitty receptionist.

1
Yeah, I know.

[end]



what if Kzzfwylgh is a manifestation of a cosmic spirit of some kind, directly informed by immediate experience (they’re at a thai place, one is a finicky, unadventurous eater) ‘i am the restaurant and the restaurant is me, like q from star trek, or Mr Mxyzptlk from superman’

wait--i had a dream that i got a notification for a groupon like this on my phone, then the next night i dreamt that i ordered that groupon then the next night i had a dream that i made reservations for the thing i got the groupon for! this must be it!

courtney has two phones-- “I have a secret phone, that one’s for me. This one’s for other people!”

let me tell you a little bit about our restaurant here--about 5000 years ago, a meteor crashed to earth carrying a silicon-based microlifeform that over the centuries has evolved to project itself to the human mind as deemed necessary by mysterious powers that be. in a way, everything is Kzzfwylgh, that dog is Kzzfwylgh, that fan is Kzzfwylgh, you are Kzzfwylgh, your secret phone is Kzzfwylgh

DAD'S TV REPAIR



[ LIGHTS UP on HENRY, who is tinkering with some indiscriminate object. He speaks to the audience. There is a table on the stage. ]

[ MUSIC THROUGHOUT SCENE. ]

HENRY
Hello, I'm Henry, but you can call me Dad. Are you young, irresponsible or not taking care of your things like you should? Do you have items in your home that seem like they would be an easy repair but your dad is too far away to take a look at them for you? Well, bring them down to Dad's TV Repair! I'll take a look at it for you since you have to live so damn far away from your old man.

[ A GIRL enters with an appliance. HENRY comes over to her. He takes the appliance and surveys it. ]

GIRL [ to the audience ]
I always stop by Dad's TV Repair when I have any minor appliance that needs repair. I receive first rate service and practical advice on care and upkeep. The sense of family I feel when I'm here eases my homesickness and creates new memories with a caring but judgmental father figure -- memories I can't make with my own father because I have to live so damn far away for no good reason.

HENRY
If you would just take care of your things I wouldn't have to do things like this! 

GIRL
I'm sorry, Dad.

HENRY
Hmm, I think, oh, this deal goes here, this deal goes here, oh wait, now it's worse. Yeah, this is a piece of junk. 

GIRL
You're right, Dad.

Henry
Why would you buy such a piece of junk? Well, I don't know what the hell's wrong with this damn contraption. [ changes into transaction mode ] Okay, so your total is $29.97, that's $13 for breaking the appliance and $16.97 for the stern lecture.

GIRL [ handing over money ]
I love you, Dad.

[ He grunts and hands the appliance to her and she leaves, smiling. He addresses the audience. ]

I guarantee that you will leave my shop just as frustrated as if you'd visited your own father or your money back! And remember: At Dad's TV Repair, our know-how goes way beyond appliances.
[ DUDE enters ]

DUDE
I'm trying to get this car loan and I don't understand this paperwork.

HENRY
What is this? This is a terrible interest rate. I told you not to get those credit cards. You'd have better credit.

[ HENRY tears up the paperwork. ] 

DUDE
Well maybe if someone had taken the time to teach me about credit....
HENRY
Never use credit. Always pay cash. If you can't pay cash, you don't need it. 

DUDE
Oh I don't need a car? How am I supposed to get to my job without a car?! One day you're all "you need to get a job" and now I have a job but I can't get to work.....

HENRY
I tell you what you need to do is, I got this friend and he'll sell you a repossessed Olds-mobile Silhouette he bought from a government auction that just needs a little work and then you and me can work on it together on Sundays.

DUDE [ exploding ]
Wha...you're totally avoiding the issue! 

HENRY
Alright, that'll be $34.50 for the closure and the referral to one of my idiot friends.

DUDE
Can I use my card?

HENRY
At Dad's TV Repair, we don't accept credit -- only cash, barter, and good old-fashioned favor-trading.

[ DUDE pays and exits happily. ]

HENRY
Here at Dad's TV Repair, I also know when to throw in the towel and admit I'm not right for the job. I'll personally recommend any of my idiot friends to assist you. There's Mark, the idiot plumber who'd probably fix that leak under your sink for a six pack. Or there's what's-his-name that idiot I met at the hardware store. He could probably retrofit that recalled crib for your baby! No wait! I can do that!

[ A WOMAN enters with a crib. There are nails sticking out. It looks bad. ]

WOMAN 
I'm not comfortable putting my child in this. Can't I just buy a new crib?

HENRY
What's wrong? I'll just saw these screws off and we can sand it down and it'll be fine! 

WOMAN
Fine? We're talking about my baby here, Dad! Doesn't that matter?

HENRY
A little paint and you won't be able to tell the difference! Don't spend the money. There's no need to spend money on a new crib. 

WOMAN
I want my child to have nice things, okay? We never had nice things! I understand that money is important, but my baby's safety is more important.

HENRY
You slept in a recalled drawer and look at you! You turned out fine! You don't need to spend more money every time one of these contraptions gets recalled! 

WOMAN
I'm sorry, Henry, I'm just not feeling it.

HENRY
Well, let's just say this argument is on the house.

[ WOMAN leaves happily. ]

HENRY
So come on down to Dad's TV Repair and get a healthy dose of fatherly wisdom for a low, low price!

[ Henry turns to continue working on the crib. ]

DIRECTOR
Cut. All right, Henry, that was good.

HENRY
Call me Dad.

DIRECTOR [ dubious ]
Okay, Dad. 

HENRY
Where's the cord that takes the pictures into the TV?

DIRECTOR
That's not how it works, Dad.

HENRY
Oh, I see the big man goes off to some technical college and suddenly the old man's a big ole useless dummy.

DIRECTOR
That wasn't what I was saying! GOD! Did you ever think that maybe I'm good at something? Maybe I've accomplished something in my life? Why can't you just be proud?

HENRY
What? You think I'm not proud of you? Of course I'm proud of you! I've ALWAYS been proud of you! I will ALWAYS be proud of you!

DIRECTOR
Really?

HENRY
Oh hell, you know. I don't gotta say it all the time for it to be true!

DIRECTOR
Thanks, Dad. I love y....

HENRY
What?

DIRECTOR
I love....wanna....wanna have a ca......


[ Then they have awkward aborted hugs and handshakes and high fives. DIRECTOR runs off and HENRY stands there satisfied. LIGHTS DOWN. MUSIC FADES OUT. ]

TORNADO’S COMIN’



[ Man sits at table, reading newspaper. On the table is a radio and a cutting board with some carrots and a chopping knife. Woman is up, looking out of a “window.” ]

[ SOUND: Radio. ]

RADIO
… devastating tornadoes have already torn through several homes in the area, leaving broken lives and homes in their wake ...

[ Man turns radio off. ]

WOMAN
Tornado’s comin’ this way.

[ Beat. ]

MAN
Sports!

[ Woman returns to table, chops carrots angrily. ]

WOMAN
So many secrets in this damn house. So many damn lies in this damn house.

MAN
They’ve been hitting that ball more! That’s gonna be good for them. Gotta keep hitting that ball, catching that ball, doing all the right things with the ball.

WOMAN
Forty years in a damn house full of lies.

MAN [ turns page ]
Looks like the prices of things are going up, but some are going down.

[ WOMAN turns on radio. ]

[ SOUND: Radio. ]

RADIO
… have just received word that an unprecedented natural phenomenon is taking place, these tornadoes are actually catching fire … citizens are highly encouraged to evacuate the area--

[ MAN changes the radio station to some dumb music. Woman goes to window. ]

WOMAN
Fire tornado’s on its way. Getting really close now. Swirlin’ winds of fire, like something loosed from hell. It’s coming this way.

MAN [ still reading ]
Ten tips for summer! “Number 10: Why not sit outside? It’s sunny!” You know, we ought to try some of these tips.

[ WOMAN goes back to angry chopping. ]

WOMAN
We never had any children.

MAN
“Number 7: A nice swim!” Not a bad idea. Not bad at all.

WOMAN
Except for the one child who died in that boating accident because we were both drunk. And then there’s the imaginary daughter that we talk about sometimes because our marriage is failing and we’re both full of guilt. And you have no sperm. The doctor said your testicles don’t make sperm any more. Just guilt. Just a jelly-like guilt substance.

MAN
“Number 5: Fruit! It’s delicious all year long, but twice as refreshing in the summer!” Maybe we can send our dear daughter Rebecca to the store for some berries. She can pick up some batteries for the clicker. Can’t change channels without the clicker!

WOMAN
We were unfaithful to each other for twenty years, until we murdered each other’s lovers. We did it together. It was the last thing we ever did together.

MAN
You know, call me crazy, but I love apples.

WOMAN
We don’t talk about it. We don’t talk about the murders.

MAN
No disrespect to citrus!

WOMAN
Why? Why don’t we talk about the murders?

MAN
Vegetables are fine, too, but apples!

WOMAN
You’d think we’d talk about the murders.

[ WOMAN turns the radio off, walks to the window. ]

[ SOUND: Huge rumbling noise. ]

WOMAN
Earth’s quakin’ now. The earthquake’s chasin’ after the fire tornado, like they’re in a race to tear this world apart. They’re comin’ this way.

MAN
Tough word jumble today. It’d be easier with a pencil. But I’ll do it in my head, just you wait and see!

[ SOUND: Dinosaur screech. ]

WOMAN
Dinosaurs comin’ out of the ground, too. Tornado’s settin’ dinosaurs on fire, throwin’ them at houses. People are gettin’ eaten by dinosaurs that are on fire. It’s all comin’ this way. Can’t be more than a half-mile off.

MAN
Good recipes this week. Rice! Just add water, and put it on the stove. It turns into something you can eat.

WOMAN
No time left.

[ She goes back to chopping. ] 
WOMAN [ singing ]
Well, I married my dream girl … but she didn’t tell me … she didn’t tell me … that her credit was bad.

MAN
Almost time for a nap, I think.

[ WOMAN drops knife, screams out the window. ]

WOMAN
What are you waiting for?!?

[ Sighs, picks up knife, keeps chopping. ]

MAN
Hope I dream about fishing.

WOMAN [ sings ]
She didn’t tell me... that her credit was bad....

[ Pause. ]

WOMAN
Do you remember? Do you remember? That night … when we were murdering each other’s lovers, and then inventing an imaginary daughter, the TV was on, remember? And there was a song.

MAN
Hope I catch me a big dream fish tonight, yes sir!

WOMAN
She didn’t tell me that her credit was bad … F-R-E-E, that spells free, credit report … dot com … baby.

MAN
There’s the one where he’s dressed like a pirate.

[ Woman, stunned, drops knife. Pause. ]

WOMAN [ sings ]
Freeeeeeee credit report dot com.

[ Man puts down paper. ]

MAN
How’s that carrot coming?

WOMAN
Done.

[ She brings the plate over to him. He gobbles down the carrot pieces loudly as she returns to the window. Sounds of horrible chaos and screaming outside. ]

WOMAN
Comin’ closer.

[ She stares out the window. The sound of chaos, mixed with the sound of man gobbling carrots. ]

WOMAN [ sings ]
We’re living in the basement at her mom and her dad’s … so … so … why’m I dressed up like a pirate in this restaurant … because … because … hatchback …

[ The sounds of chaos suddenly stop. ]

WOMAN
Wait … wait! It’s goin’ somewhere else. It’s goin’ away! The earth stopped quakin’. The fires are all out. The dinosaurs … they’re, they’re just wandering off. They seem bored. It’s a new day. A new day.

[ She looks over. Man is face down, dead. He choked on a carrot piece. ]

WOMAN
Dammit, you never swallow those carrots right!

[ Gets up and screams in his face. ]

WOMAN
Drunk! Failure!

[ Strokes his head, sings. ]

WOMAN
She didn’t tell me … that her credit was bad....

[ A young female voice from upstairs. ]

VOICE
Mommy! I’ve got poop on my butt!

WOMAN
One minute, honey!

[ She grabs the knife. ]

WOMAN
Little imaginary pain in my ass, I swear, Jesus, urgh, I just--

[ Exits frame. ]

THE END DERP DERP


AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION SKETCH

[ LIGHTS UP ON CURTIS AND JOEL. ]

CURTIS:
Hi, everyone.

JOEL:
Hi.

[ Ad-lib bullshit. ]

CURTIS:
So, we've got a sketch right here that requires some assistance from the audience.

JOEL:
It's a sketch for three people, but as you can see, it's just the two of us right now.

CURTIS:
So would anyone be willing to just come up here and read along with us?

[ Select a volunteer from the audience. ]

JOEL:
What's your name?

[ Audience member responds. Curtis and Joel gesture toward the printed script they have handed him. ]

CURTIS:
Your lines are in there. Under "audience member."

JOEL:
So what's your name?

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Francis.

JOEL:
What do you do for a living?

[ Gesture toward script. ]

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I'm a systems administrator for a medium-sized internet startup company, and golly, there are a lot of frustrations that I encounter in my job. Why, just the other day, my immediate supervisor comes to me with an email security issue. Normally, I am all too eager to address such issues, but her attitude was--

CURTIS:
OK, OK, that's great, Francis.

JOEL:
Let's just do the sketch now.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
OK.

[ Curtis and Joel arrange some chairs, indicate that the audience member should sit in one of them. Joel hands the audience member a gnome. ]

CURTIS:
OK, in this sketch you're going to play the king of the gnomes, so try to adopt a regal yet subterranean bearing.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
This is stupid.

JOEL:
What did you just say?

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I didn't say anything.

JOEL:
OK.

[ Curtis and Joel put on goofy gnome caps. ]

JOEL:
Great king, we have gathered many mushrooms for the Forest Feast.

CURTIS:
Tonight, I have waltzed with a fox! I have made love to the daffodils! What may we do further to serve your will, my liege?

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I don't want to read the things that you've written down for me to say. I just want to talk.

CURTIS:
Hold on, Francis. We brought you up here in good faith.

JOEL:
We're just trying to have a little fun while learning about gnomes.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I don't think this is fun. I think it's stupid to read these things. I want to say my own things. I want to talk about a frustrating incident that occurred at my job.

CURTIS:
Francis, you're being kind of a dick.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
And I will continue to be a dick! I will continue to be a dick! I have a story about email security that needs to be told! Fate chose to give me a public forum tonight, and I don't intend to waste it on these stupid lines that you've written for me. Tonight, Francis's voice will be heard! Tonight, Francis's story will be told!

JOEL:
Francis, just stick to the script, please.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I'm a person with things to say!

CURTIS:
Can you at least read the punchline so that this doesn't fizzle out anticlimactically?

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
No, I will not.

JOEL:
That's just great.

CURTIS:
Fantastic.

JOEL:
Thanks for (starting us out on the right foot/ruining the show), Francis.

CURTIS:
Real nice. Hope you're proud of yourself.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I am proud of myself. I am proud of myself for the first time.

JOEL:
Good-bye, Francis.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
I should go anyway, I have a very important fucking appointment with your mom. That's an appointment me and her make to fuck.

JOEL:
What!?

[ Curtis holds Joel back. ]

CURTIS:
Joel! Never hit the audience! Never hit!

JOEL:
YOU SYSTEMS-ADMINISTRATIN' SON OF A BITCH! I'LL KILL YOU!

[ Audience member holds the gnome over his/her crotch like a penis and thrusts hips. ]

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
This is what I look like when I fuck your mom, if this gnome were my penis!

[ Curtis starts laughing. ]

CURTIS:
That is what it would look like!

[ To Joel. ]

Joel, look! He has a point! That is what fucking looks like.

[ Joel starts laughing. ]

JOEL:
In all fairness, that's the funniest thing I've ever seen.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Now, which of us judged the other too quickly?

CURTIS AND JOEL:
It was us.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
That's right.

[ The three stand apart and face the audience. ]

JOEL:
I never saw Francis again, but I knew I would never forget him.

CURTIS:
I still see Francis regularly, though I often don't recognize him.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
And me? Well, I'm still administrating systems, keeping email secure, dealing with my immediate supervisor. But I often think of that day, that wonderful day, when for a few magic moments, I was the gnome king. Usually when I am fucking Joel's mom, which looks like this.

[ He repeats the hip thrusts. ]

JOEL:
Thank you, Francis.

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Thanks.

CURTIS:
How many times in the script do we say "thank you" before you sit down?

AUDIENCE MEMBER:
Three.

JOEL:
Thank you, Francis.

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS:
Thank you.

[ Audience member returns to audience and sits down. Curtis and Joel thank him. LIGHTS DOWN. ]


CURRENT RESEARCH



[ Three people: a performer, a historian, and a director. The historian and director are seated. The performer is standing and is dressed in an old-timey garb, holding a cigar. ]

PERFORMER
… that’s when Mr. President Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned from my deep glass of mash whuskey. “Will you lead this Union army or not?”, he asked me, with them haunted eyes and that face like a raw cord of wood. “Yes sir, I will,” I said, wiping my ow n sick from my beard. “As sure as my name is Ulysses S. Grant, I will.”

DIRECTOR
Terry, that’s great. You’ve captured the two sides of Ulysses S. Grant there: the stout citizen-general, and the man beset by his own demons.

PERFORMER
Yeah, that’s what I was going for.

HISTORIAN
Well...

DIRECTOR
Yes?

HISTORIAN
It’s good theater, absolutely. But as your historical consultant, there’s just a few things I would add for the sake of accuracy.

PERFORMER
Sure, Greg. I want this show to engage with real historical facts.

HISTORIAN
Well, first of all, current research suggests that Grant didn’t talk like that. You know, that “history voice” you’re doing, that bass tone.

DIRECTOR
No?

HISTORIAN
Forensic linguists have actually studied Grant’s jawbone, and used computer modeling to reconstruct the surface of his tongue, and it turns out that Grant had a strong lisp.

DIRECTOR
Really?

HISTORIAN
Current research suggests that, yes.

DIRECTOR
Huh. Well, I’m a little concerned that--

HISTORIAN
Maybe we could just try it, Lisa? Lisa, let’s just try it.

PERFORMER
We do want to engage with the real historical facts.

HISTORIAN
Let’s just try it.

PERFORMER [ now with a lisp ]
… thath when Mr. Prethident Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned away from my deep glath of mathh whuthkey--

HISTORIAN
A little stronger, Terry.

DIRECTOR
Really?

HISTORIAN [ rifling through his binder ]
I can show you the model of his tongue...

DIRECTOR
No, fine. Uh, let’s try it.

PERFORMER [ now with a stronger lisp ]
… thath when Mr. Prethident Lincoln pulled me--

HISTORIAN
You’re at, like, a six. Current research suggests take it up to a 9.5.

PERFORMER [ nearly incomprehensible ]
… thath when Mr. Prethident Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned from my deep glath of mathh whuthkey. “Will you lead thith Union army or not?”, he athked me, with them haunted eyeth and that face like a raw cord of wood.

HISTORIAN
Crank it up just a smidge, Terry, and I think you got it.

DIRECTOR
Hmm. Couple notes. One, Terry, I’m a little concerned that it might be really hard to understand what you’re saying. Since it’s just you talking to the audience the entire time, it might make the show not a very good experience. Two, Greg, current research aside, I think people will be so surprised by the lisp that it will take them out of the performance.

HISTORIAN
But we want to educate people, right? On that note, let’s talk appearance. To be clear, besides being all wrong, your look is great.

DIRECTOR
You want to do something with the beard? Go bigger?

HISTORIAN
Lose the beard. Current research suggests that Grant’s beard is a popular misconception. Not only did he lack a beard, he had no jaw. He lost it in a smelting accident.

DIRECTOR
There are lots of photographs of Grant with a beard.

HISTORIAN
The research suggests that that’s some other guy.

DIRECTOR
How are we supposed to make him look like he doesn’t have a jaw?

HISTORIAN
Can plays do CGI? Only movies?

DIRECTOR
I’d like to see your research.

HISTORIAN
Sure.

[ He pulls out a jar with some wadded up paper in it. ]

HISTORIAN
I prefer to print out my research and carry it in jars. It feels good in my backpack.

PERFORMER
Greg, let’s forget the jaw thing. It’s not practical.

HISTORIAN
It’s your funeral.

DIRECTOR
Let’s just take it from the top, Terry. Let’s dial the lisp back. Let’s just try that.

HISTORIAN
It’s your dumb funeral. I apologize. I shouldn’t say “dumb.” It’s your normal funeral.

DIRECTOR
Go.

PERFORMER
… that’s when Mr. President Lincoln pulled me up from the bar. I turned away from my deep glass of mash--

HISTORIAN
Terry, can we talk physicality? You’re doing a lot of walking. You should roll more.

PERFORMER
Like...?

HISTORIAN
On the ground. Researchers have made exciting discoveries about Grant’s bones. They’re very consistent with bones that have been rolled on.

DIRECTOR
Excuse me?

HISTORIAN
The smoothing around his tibia suggests near-constant rolling.

PERFORMER
I’m not entirely sure I could do that? You might need a Cirque du Soleil type guy.

DIRECTOR Terry, you’re not going to roll around onstage.

HISTORIAN
Lisa, can we pleaaaaaaase just tryyyyyyy it?!

DIRECTOR
No.

HISTORIAN
Fine.

[ Whips out computer, starts typing furiously, then finishes. ]

Done!

DIRECTOR
Done what?

HISTORIAN
I submitted a paper to the American Journal of History, and now the most current, up-to-date historical research suggests that I’m the new director of this play.

DIRECTOR
What?

HISTORIAN
Check the program.

[ Director pulls out a program, reads it, throws it to the ground. ]

DIRECTOR
Bastard!

PERFORMER
Lisa, show our director some respect.

[ Historian types furiously again. ]

HISTORIAN
I just submitted another. Current research suggests that no one likes you, Lisa.

PERFORMER
Yeah, Lisa, you jerk.

DIRECTOR
Stop!

HISTORIAN
You stop, jerk.

[ Director grabs the computer. ]

HISTORIAN
Give it back!

PERFORMER
Classic Lisa bullshit.

[ Director types furiously. ]

DIRECTOR
Oh hey, guess what? Now the most current, up-to-date historical research suggests that you’re made of farts.

[ Fart sounds. ]

HISTORIAN
Oh noooooo! I’m evaporating!

[ Disappears. ]

DIRECTOR
Yeah, Greg, let’s just try it.

PERFORMER
You evaporated our director.

[ Director starts typing furiously, then finishes. ]

DIRECTOR
Current historical research suggests you don’t care.

PERFORMER
You’re right. I don’t!

DIRECTOR
All right. Let’s take it from the top...

[ Transition into Ken Burns style closer? ]

[ LIGHTS UP. COURTNEY is onstage drinking from a teacup and reading the paper ]

COURTNEY:
Mmmmmm, delicious Dr. Pepper.

CURTIS: [ from offstage ]
Ding Dong!

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ She collects her stuff and rushes around trying to tidy up.  She answers the door. ]

COURTNEY:
Curtis!

CURTIS:
Courtney!

[ CURTIS is carrying a teacup and a newspaper. They sit and read and drink. ]

CURTIS:
Mmmmmm, delicious Dr. Pepper.

COURTNEY:
Yes, refreshing.

JOEL: [offstage]
Ding dong!

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ Curtis and Courtney pick up their stuff and rush around the stage trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

Curtis: [opening the door]
It's Joel!!

Joel:
Hey guys! Dr. Pepper time!

[ Joel produces his own paper and teacup. They all sit down and read and drink. ]

CURTIS:
Ah, that Hagar the Horrible--such a ding dong!

[ Their heads all snap up. ]

COURTNEY:
Someone's at the door!

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

JOEL:
Who is it?

CURTIS:
There's no one there.

COURTNEY:
That's strange. I heard the doorbell. I swear I heard "ding dong!"

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
Who is it.

JOEL:
There's no one there.

COURTNEY:
That's strange.

[ They close the door.]

JOEL:
What's going on? Is someone ringing the doorbell and running off?

CURTIS:
I don't know. It's really weird.

COURTNEY:
Guys, I think I know what's going on. Everytime someone says "ding dong"....

[ They all collect their stuff and rush around trying to tidy up. They answer the door. ]

CURTIS:
This is so weird!

[ They close the door ]

JOEL:
What were you saying, Courtney?

COURTNEY:
Every time one of us says.....the "D" word, someone rings the door bell.

CURTIS:
That makes so much sense!

JOEL:
Are you saying we can summon stuff, we can make things happen just by making noises?

COURTNEY:
Yes.

CURTIS:
Wow.

JOEL:
BOOM!

[ They all panic, running around screaming "Get Down!" "Take Cover!" They eventually calm down. ]

CURTIS:
Joel! Don’t do that!

JOEL:
Sorry. I just got excited.

COURTNEY:
Booooo, Joel.

[ They all freak out  running around yelling that there’s a ghost. ]

JOEL:
Maybe that’s who’s been ringing the doorbell!

CURTIS:
A ghost?

COURTNEY:
That makes so much sense!

CURTIS:
No, Courtney, it really doesn’t. And here’s what I think of your ghost theory.

[ makes fart sound with his mouth ]

COURTNEY and JOEL: [ holding their noses ]
EEEEWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
No, it’s just a sound I’m making with my mouth. [ makes the fart sound again ]

COURTNEY and JOEL:
EwWWWWWWW!

CURTIS:
Guys, it’s not real. Watch. [ makes the fart sound again ]

[ COURTNEY stops holding her nose. ]

COURTNEY:
He’s right, Joel, it doesn’t stink.

JOEL:
I’m not taking that chance.

CURTIS:
Guys, we’re just falling victim to a stage convention.

COURTNEY:
A what?

CURTIS:
Sounds we make with our mouths are representations of real sounds when we want them to be.

JOEL:
Okay, then, Smarty Pants. How did you know I was at the door?

CURTIS:
You said “Ding dong”........

[ They all rush around trying to clean up and answer the door. LIGHTS DOWN after a few seconds. ]

[  LIGHTS UP.  A man sits at a table in a restaurant. He is reading a book. He is obviously confused. A waiter slowly and stealthily approaches. The waiter produces a paper towel tube and lightly touches it to the unsuspecting man’s face. The man swats it away. ]

PATRON
HEY!

WAITER
Hey there.

PATRON
What WAS that?

WAITER
What?

PATRON
What was THAT?

WAITER
My name is Ken, sir. I’ll be your waiter this evening. Can I start you off with a beverage?

PATRON
Water. I drink water.

WAITER
Yes sir.

[ The waiter exits and the man continues reading. The waiter enters and like before he is slow and stealthy. He produces a wrapping paper tube and lightly touches it to the man’s face. The man swats it away. ]

PATRON
HEY!

WAITER
Hey there.

PATRON
What the hell -

WAITER
What did you order to drink, sir?

PATRON
What?

WAITER
Your beverage sir. I forgot your order.

PATRON
I ordered wa -

[ As the man is speaking the waiter touches the tube to the man’s mouth. The man swats it away. ]

HEY!

[ The manager enters. ]

MANAGER
Is there a problem here? I heard yelling.

PATRON
He’s touchin’ my face with stuff. I don’t like it.

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
Is this true?

WAITER
Yes.

MANAGER [ to patron ]
Did you ask him to stop?

PATRON
YES!

WAITER
No he didn’t.

MANAGER [ to patron ]
Is this true?

PATRON
Yes.

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
Please stop touching his face.

PATRON
He was touchin’ my face!

MANAGER
I know, sir.

PATRON
With some cardboard tubes!

MANAGER
I am so sorry, sir. I see that you are without a drink. May we serve you a beverage?

PATRON
I drink water!

[ The manager gestures to the waiter who immediateley exits. ]

MANAGER
Of course, your bill will be taken care of by the restaurant.

PATRON
That’s what I expect for him touchin’ my face with that tubin’.

MANAGER
Is there anything else I can do to make your meal more enjoyable?

PATRON
I wanna read this book.

MANAGER
Very good, sir. I will leave you to it.

[ The manager exits. The waiter, from offstage, lifts several cardboard tubes taped together to make a very long tube, and touches it to the man’s face. ]

PATRON
He’s touchin’ my face again! You asked him not to and he still touched my face.

[ The manager enters. ]

MANAGER
Was he doing it again?

PATRON
Yes.

MANAGER
Did he do it like this?

[ Manager produces a tube and pokes the patron’s face. ]

Or was it more like this?

[ Manager picks up the very long tube and pokes it offstage, opposite the patron. The tube appears behind the patron and pokes him in the back of the head. The poking continues. ]

PATRON
Hey! Stop it! You guys are annoying.

MANAGER
Well this is who we.

[ WAITER enters with a glass. ]

WAITER
And we can’t help it. And here’s you’re water.

PATRON
This glass is empty.

MANAGER
I hope that’s not annoying you.

WAITER
Here’s your bill.

PATRON
But I didn’t even have anything.

[ PAUSE ]

MANAGER
You should leave now.

[ Patron leaves in a huff. ]

WAITER
He didn’t even leave a tip.

MANAGER
No, but I can do this.

[ Manager picks up the long tube and speaks into it. ]

Your a bad waiter and everyone thinks you stink.

WAITER
Hey!

[ LIGHTS DOWN ]


Toward end, jump forward to TR presenting Sino-Phillipine Land Bridge to the public. He is booed. WH Taft enters like Jabba the Hut and proposes many exciting new canals. TR punches him in the stomach and his fist gets caught. Taft leans in to eat him.

"My name is future President Taft and I have many fine ideas for some canals. USA USA USA!!"

Canals that spell "TAFT" across America. SPELLS TAFT! TAFT S.A.! TAFT S.A.!

"And that's how William Howard Taft became America's most popular and celebrated president."

[A desk. TEDDY ROOSEVELT sits at the desk, face down. He is surrounded by crumpled pieces of paper. Someone enters with a sign: "This is President Theodore Roosevelt." Next sign: "Builder of the great Panama Canal." Next sign: "BUILD ANOTHER CANAL!" He/she mimes chanting. The audience (hopefully) begins chanting "Build another canal!" Suddenly, TR's head jerks up. He grabs a fresh piece of paper and a pen, begins scribbling. He stops. He crumples the paper up and hurls it.]

TR: Let it be damned, I say! Let it all be straightly damned!

[He slumps down again.]

TR: Silence, you vultures! Your cries torment me!

[A knock offstage from WILBERFORCE, his aide.]

WILBERFORCE: Sir? Mr. President?

TR: Yes, Wilberforce, yes?

[Pause.]

WILBERFORCE: Sir, I hate to be a bore on this subject, but may I once more state my bottomless admiration for the splendid achievement of the Panama Canal?

TR: If you insist.

WILBERFORCE: It is a magnificent boon to world commerce.

TR: That is its intent, Wilberforce.

[Pause.]

WILBERFORCE: Sir?

TR: Damn you Wilberforce, what is it?

WILBERFORCE: I don't mean to presume too much, sir, or compound the impossible burdens that you bear as a leader of men. Still, sir, the sentiment coursing through our nation presses me to ask--

TR: Out with it, Wilberforce, you flattering toad!

WILBERFORCE: ... Sir. At present, have we any ideas for our next canal?

TR: [hurls a paper at the door] FOR THE THOUSANDTH BLASTED TIME, WILBERFORCE, YOU DEVIL, I'M WORKING ON IT!!

WILBERFORCE: Apologies, sir!

TR: BEGONE BEFORE I EXILE YOU TO SOME DIPLOMATIC OUTPOST WHERE PROVIDENCE SHAN'T REACH YOU! MAY YOU TASTE A HUNDRED LASHES FROM AN OTTOMAN WHIP!

[TR begins weeping. Pause.]

WILBERFORCE: May I enter?

TR: Come in, blast you.

WILBERFORCE: Forgive me, sir. I know not the pressures of greatness.

TR: [wiping a tear] Not so, Wilberforce, for you are a very great fool indeed.

[They laugh.]

TR: Oh, Wilberforce. The weight of expectation hangs like an albatross round my neck. I had not expected the Panama Canal to inspire such a hysteria of adulation. My hope was it should be received as a modest achievement, not an exemplary masterpiece that I must strive to outdo.

WILBERFORCE: Perhaps we needn't do another canal at all.

TR: Bah, Wilberforce! Hogswollop. I've heard the cry of the streets; it echoes in the halls of Congress and bellows from every newspaper headline: "Build another canal! Build another canal! Build another canal!"

[Hopefully the audience starts chanting it again.]

TR: You hear, Wilberforce?? It resounds in my brain, day and night. America demands a bigger, better canal.

WILBERFORCE: Must it be bigger, sir? The Panama Canal was a grand statement of engineering, but the next one could be smaller, more intimate, more personal. "America gets back to its roots as a canal-digging nation--"

TR: Damn you, Wilberforce. It would be derided as a cowardly failure of vision! The world wants to see ambition!

WILBERFORCE: [gesturing at the paper] Surely you have some suitable idea among these?

TR: All rubbish, Wilberforce.

WILBERFORCE: Your standards are exacting, sir, but the public eye is not so keen. [He takes one of the crumpled sheets.]

TR: No!

[They struggle over the paper. Wilberforce uncrumples it and reads.]

WILBERFORCE: The Trans-Yukon Canal?

[TR sighs.]

TR: Idiotic, I know.

WILBERFORCE: ... I'm not sure, sir. Perhaps if we were to alter the route you've proposed slightly--

TR: Nonsense! [He snatches the paper and tears it up.]

WILBERFORCE: There must be some idea here that you like, sir.

[Pause.]

TR: There was one. [Rummages through the papers.] It was birthed of an innovative spirit. Yes ... now that I recall, it was a bold notion indeed. Here. The Kansas Piggyback. [Hands paper to Wilberforce.]

WILBERFORCE: It runs through the middle of the nation?

TR: Down the border of Kansas and Nebrasaka, yes.

WILBERFORCE: I have trouble, sir, discerning the purpose. It does not connect two larger bodies of water.

TR: Wilberforce, are we to limit ourselves only to our petrified ideas of what a canal is and what it ought to do?

WILBERFORCE: Sir, I fear that in the wake of a traditional masterwork of the form like the Panama Canal, this would come off as an overly self-conscious piece of experimentation.

TR: DAMN IT ALL!

[He grabs it and tears it up, slumps on his desk. Pause.]

WILBERFORCE: Perhaps we should approach this quandary from another angle, sir.

TR: [Head still down.] I'm listening.

WILBERFORCE: Perhaps it's not another canal that the nation wants. Perhaps ...

TR: Yes.

WLBERFORCE: Perhaps any two large pieces of similar geography bridged through man's ingenuity will give satisfaction.

[Leap forward to a TR press conference.]

BUT IT’S YOGURT #1



[ LIGHTS UP. Curtis is onstage, reading a book. ]

CURTIS
I could use a beer right now.

[ Courtney and Joel begin having a conversation offstage. ]

JOEL
Man, this is cold and delicious.

COURTNEY
It really is.

[ Curtis gets up, begins walking in circles, increasingly excited. ]

JOEL
I love the smooth way it goes down my throat.

COURTNEY
I think the operative word here is “refreshment.”

JOEL
Refreshment is right!

COURTNEY
These come in packs of six.

JOEL
Do they? I’ll have to get one of those sixpacks.

COURTNEY
It’s gonna make me belch.

JOEL
What a great thing to enjoy on a hot day, or out with your friends.

COURTNEY
One-hundred percent agree with you.

[ LIGHTS UP. Curtis is onstage, reading a book. Curtis reaches up to scratch his head. ]

CURTIS
Ugh, my hair.

[ Courtney and Joel begin having a conversation offstage. ]

JOEL
Courtney, what have you been putting in your hair?

COURTNEY
This product I’ve got here -- it’s a surefire way to defeat dryness.

JOEL
Wow, I’d like to try that sometime.

[ Curtis gets up, begins walking in circles, increasingly excited. ]

COURTNEY
You should, Joel. It’s satisfying. It feels good. It smells good. It’s got a nice texture.

JOEL
It’s something I’d like to try. Can I buy it in a store?

COURTNEY
Of course you can, Joel.

JOEL
I bet it would feel soothing on my scalp.

COURTNEY
It does sooth the scalp.

JOEL
I want to try some now!

COURTNEY
Well, here you go.

Thanks, Courtney. They’re comfortable.

COURTNEY
What material are they made of?

JOEL
The best material. Hey, I saw you got yourself at little present today.

COURTNEY
Oh, yes. It’s very nice. I like to sit in it and go different places.

JOEL
How fast does it go?

COURTNEY
It goes so fast, Joel.

JOEL
Do you like it when it moves?

COURTNEY
Yes! Did you see the thing that everyone’s been talking about?

JOEL
No, I need to get out and see it.

COURTNEY
It’s very entertaining.

It has Michael Douglas in it.

It does!

You definitely know this feeling because it definitely happens to you every day. You think people are talking about something else. But really they’re talking about yogurt. But it’s yogurt. By Dannon! Because it’s not something else. It’s yogurt. By Dannon! By Dannon!






[ Two people are upstage facing the back and are speaking excitedly about something that’s not yogurt. One person is downstage facing the audience and “eavesdropping” on the conversation. The eavesdropper gets very excited about the conversation that’s happening. The two people upstage turn around and reveal that they were talking about yogurt the whole time. A pre-recorded voiceover says “You thought they were talking about something else but they were talking about yogurt. Try new “But It’s Yogurt” from Dannon. ]

[Two WRITERS sitting on opposite sides of a desk. One is a grizzled vet, the other an eager novice. A phone on the desk. Ideally, they'd have typewriters and visors ... might have to make do with yellow legal pads.]

1: [without looking up] Damn fine piece of work last week.

2: You're making me blush.

1: No shit.

[They keep writing.]

2: Well, it wasn't exactly the first story about Tommy Lee Jones's passion for polo.

1: No, but it went the deepest. A damn good piece.

2: You mean that, huh?

1: Don't dwell on it. You know how it is here; you're only as good as your last story.

2: What, I look like some snot-nosed Columbia School of Journalism brat? I may not have your mileage, old-timer, but these fingers have gotten plenty inky in their time.

1: Sometimes I forget, kid.

[1 pulls out a flask, drinks, hands it to 2, who also drinks. The EDITOR enters, holding a copy of Parade magazine.]

E: McCruvney! I said it before, and I'll say it again, but you hit the goddam bullseye with this _____________________ piece. [choose the most inane article from that particular issue of Parade]

1: Don't you know that's why you keep my sorry, crusty ass around?

E: I hope you're watching and learning, kid. McCruvney may be a drunk asshole, but he knows a good story.

2: At least he knows how to fall backwards into one every once in a while.

[They laugh. Pause.]

E: All right, damn it. You two know by now I don't come down here with good news unless I have some bad news to go with it.

1: Oh, Christ, Gary --

E: Yeah, you can probably guess.

2: More cutbacks?

E: That's the word from on high, children. Publisher's making them across the board. Such is the sorry lot of "dead-tree" media in our internet age.

1: Blogs.

2: Goddam blogs.

1: Fucking blogs.

E: You're the choir preaching to the preacher, kids.

1: I swear to God, Gary, what the hell happened to people? Time was, we had something called an attention span. Folks would sit down on a Sunday morning with their coffee and read "A Day with Chevy Chase" or "Delta Burke's Personal Battles" or "The Lighter Side of Madam Secretary: A Tour of Madeline Albright's Long Island Home." And goddammit, they would not answer the phone, their children would know not to interrupt them till they'd read all three pages.

2: Now it's all one paragraph. "Chevy Chase to pen autobiography." "Delta Burke unveils new line of scarves." "Madeline Albright in drunken brawl outside D.C. club." It's not real celebrity journalism, it just ... fucking McNuggets. [pause] Online McNugget journalism. [pause] E-McJournalism.

E: You think I like it? Why don't you join me on the beach and we can all order the tide backward? [pause] All right. Like I said, there are gonna be some cutbacks. So let's see those pens.

[1 and 2 clutch their pens protectively.]

E: The bosses gave me a choice. The pens or your jobs. What do you prefer?

[Reluctantly, they surrender their pens. E takes them, takes a stubby pencil from behind his ear and hands it to 1.]

E: For the both of you. And unless you can make ink out of your own spit and feces, I suggest you make that last till end of the month. Another thing, everyone's gonna have to carry more weight to get us through. [He pulls out a few envelopes.] You two are gonna have to pick up Walter's slack.

2: Jesus, Gary, you fired Walter?

E: No. Walter's dead. They found him hunched over his typewriter this morning.

[He divides the envelopes between the two of them.]

E: Go forth proudly, you two. A soldier is honorable even in defeat. [Exits.]

2: We are a dying breed.

1: Yeah, some of us sooner than others. You should get out of this rotten business. No need for a young kid like you to go down with the ship.

2: I'm older than you think.

[A moment of mutual respect. They both open an envelope and unfold the letters inside.]

1: [reading] "Dear Parade, I am a big fan of Lorenzo Lamas of TV's Renegade. Is he currently working on any projects? And does he ride a motorcycle in real life? Florence Bessberg, Ft. Rialto, Florida."

2: [reading] "Dear Parade, I just love Anthony LaPaglia of CBS's Without a Trace. I'd like him to come looking for me someday! What else has he been in? Rosie Dunwoody, Mule Dropping, Oklahoma." Jesus Christ, can't these people use the internet?

[Pause. 1 looks at 2 severely.]

2: [sheepish] Sorry.

[1 hands 2 the pencil. 2 begins writing on the pad. 1 picks up the phone, dials, waits.]

1: Marty? Ed McCruvney from Parade. ... I've got a question here about one of your clients. ... Don't give me that sour sadsack attitude. ... Well, I'm sorry if Mr. Sorbo thought we were talking off the record last time. Jesus, Marty, he's a big boy, he should know I'm trying to get a story. ... No, no, no. You listen ... Fine. ... This isn't that kind of story anyway, Marty. ... Yeah. ... I just need to know if your boy Lorenzo rides motorcycles in real life. ... No kidding? ... No kidding? ... Could we get a picture?

Part 1

[A BUSINESSMAN is sitting at his desk, barking into his cell phone.]

BUSINESSMAN: Sell it, you idiot! Sell it now, then buy it back, then sell it to me, then I sell it to you. Meanwhile, they're out there buying it. Then we sell it all, and buy it again when it hits point two! Hold on!

[He looks at the phone, pushes a button to take another call.]

BUSINESSMAN: What?... Yes!... No!... Shit!... OK!... Fuck!... Motherfuck!... No!... Nonono!... Yes!

[He moves the phone away from his ear, mutters.]

BUSINESSMAN: Asshole.

[He presses the intercom.]

BUSINESSMAN: Coffee!

[He begins furiously typing on an invisible laptop. Pause. The phone rings. He snatches it up and answers.]
 
BUSINESSMAN: Yes?

[A deep, modulated, disguised voice comes from the phone.]

VOICE: Mr. Lewis?

BUSINESSMAN: Yes?

VOICE: Listen very carefully to what I'm about to say... I have your son, Daniel ... Do not call the police... If you want to see him again, you will follow my instructions exactly...

[Businessman holds the phone with his shoulder, begins typing on his invisible laptop.]

VOICE: Daniel and I are at the zoo... We have come here because the weather is good today, and he said that he wanted to see the giant python that the zoo recently acquired... There is an Arby's a few blocks away, on 18th and General Pershing. Your son is hungry, and he has told me that he likes seasoned curly fries. In ten minutes, I will take your son to the Arby's a buy him a medium order of seasoned curly fries. You will arrive there 15 minutes from now, at 1:50. Give or take a few minutes, because I know traffic is bad. Park your car in the lot, enter the Arby's and pick your son up. Bring two dollars ... two one dollar bills, because I do not have any change... Do not involve the police, Mr. Lewis... if you do, you will have wasted their time and probably incur a small fine. Oh, and one more thing Mr. Lewis...

[Ominous pause.]

VOICE: If you don't have two dollars to cover the cost of the fries, don't worry about it. It's really no big deal.

[Click. Dial tone. Harrowed to the core, the business hangs up and puts the phone on his desk.]

BUSINESSMAN: Nice guy.

Part 2

[A car. The businessman driving. His son, DANNY, is riding shotgun and eating some Arby's curly fries. A long, awkward pause.]

BUSINESSMAN: Well, did you have a nice time with the kidnapper today?

DANNY: Um. Sure, I guess.

[Pause.]

BUSINESSMAN: How was the python?

DANNY: I dunno.

BUSINESSMAN: Was it cool?

DANNY: Yeah, it was pretty cool.

[Pause.]

BUSINESSMAN: You know, it's not like I didn't remember. I was going to take you to the zoo.

DANNY: Sure, dad.

BUSINESSMAN: I was going to take you this weekend.

DANNY: Sure.

BUSINESSMAN: Now I guess I don't have to, huh?

[Pause.]

BUSINESSMAN: You know, I work very hard. That's why we can't always go out and do things. Because your dad is working very hard so that he can go out and buy you a goddam Nintendo DS so you can play your damn Nintendo games. All right?

DANNY: Dad, why are you making a big deal?

BUSINESSMAN: Why are you cutting me out of your life?!

[Pause.]

DANNY: Can we go to the arcade?

BUSINESSMAN: Maybe you'll get to go next time you're abducted.

[Pause. Businessman reaches over, grabs a curly fry and sticks it in his mouth.]

Part 3

[Businessman at his desk, barking into his cell phone.]

BUSINESSMAN: Who the hell told you to buy it back? ... No, I told you to buy it back from me. Only from me. Well, that's why you're taking a bath now, buddy. That's why we're both taking baths. That's why I'm right behind you giving your back a good scrub, and pretty soon it's gonna be my turn, so -- hold on, I have a call on the other line.

[He switches lines.]

BUSINESSMAN: Yeah.

VOICE: Mr. Lewis?

[Businessman stands up, startled.]

BUSINESSMAN: What the hell do you want?

VOICE: I suggest you remain calm, Mr. Lewis.

BUSINESSMAN: Where are you? Where's Daniel?

VOICE: I might ask you the same question, Mr. Lewis.

[Pause.]

BUSINESSMAN: Hold on just a damn second. I thought we had it very clear that I had him first Friday of the month.

VOICE: We agreed on every other month.

BUSINESSMAN: The hell we did. I'm sick of re-arguing this every month.

VOICE: Mr. Lewis, I was going to take Daniel to the planetarium. He's been excited all week. Now, Mr. Lewis, I suppose you can tell him that's not happening anymore.

BUSINESSMAN: No, no, no. Don't you set me up to be the bad guy.

VOICE: Mr. Lewis, you leave me no choice.

BUSINESSMAN: He's my son, dammit!

VOICE: He's my victim, Mr. Lewis, so stop trying to drive a wedge between us.

[Pause.]

BUSINESSMAN: All right. I guess we're all going to the planetarium, then.

VOICE: Mr. Lewis?

BUSINESSMAN: I don't want Danny to be disappointed, but you sure as hell aren't taking my Friday. I can behave myself if you can.

[Pause.]

VOICE: Very well, Mr. Lewis. Bring Danny to the planetarium at precisely six o'clock. Do not be late, Mr. Lewis. You'll find me by the Jupiter exhibit. Oh, and Mr. Lewis --

BUSINESSMAN: I know, I know. Don't bring the cops. [He hangs up. Sighs. Leans back in his chair.] You know, it's hardest on the kids. 

[ INTRO VIDEO PLAYS. MUSIC PLAYS. LIGHTS UP. CURTIS AND JOEL ENTER. ]

CURTIS:
Hey everybody!

JOEL:
We are Your Terrific Neighbors.

[ Ad-lib bullshitting. ]

JOEL:
We're very proud to be performing in the Out of Bounds festival.

CURTIS:
It's a very exciting event. We've got a lot of performers in from all over the country, and beyond.

JOEL:
I bet a lot of them got here on the finest mode of transportation available to us: the airplane.

CURTIS:
Oh man, I've had some pretty frustrating times in airports.

 JOEL:
We all have. With all those crazy characters and stuff that can happen.

CURTIS:
Did I tell you what happened the last time I was at the airport?

JOEL:
You sure did. Man, that sounded like a real doozy of a situation.

CURTIS:
It was.

[ Pause. ]

Let's talk about something else.

JOEL:
I went to a dinner party last weekend.

CURTIS:
Did you?

JOEL:
 I sure did. Let me tell you, there were quite a few zany characters in attendance.

CURTIS:
Well, I'll be.

JOEL:
There was this guy there who had the craziest habit. It was a really funny, comical tic.

CURTIS:
Huh.

JOEL:
I remembered thinking to myself, "Boy, if I saw that in a live sketch comedy show, I'd sure laugh."

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS:
That sounds fun. Hey, did you hear about the latest foolish public utterance from a major political figure?

JOEL:
I sure did. I read about it in the paper.

CURTIS:
I'm glad you keep up with current events.

JOEL:
I am too.

[ Pause. ]

I've also been reading this biography of Ernest Hemingway.

CURTIS:
Is it interesting?

JOEL:
Very much so. And yesterday, I had my first Pilates class.

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS:
Hmm. Can you imagine what it would be like if Ernest Hemingway was a pilates instructor?

JOEL:
No!

CURTIS:
Imagine it.

[ They chuckle. ]

JOEL:
Oh, I see. He'd be very out of place in that environment.

CURTIS:
That's why I'm laughing!

[ Pause. ]

JOEL:
OK, I think everyone's warmed up.

CURTIS:
Let's perform the sketches that we've written down in the order in which we wrote them.

[ Curtis pulls out the set list for the show. ]

JOEL:
Let's. Do. That.

CURTIS:
We'll start with the intro. Lights down!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

JOEL:
Curtis.

CURTIS:
What?

JOEL:
I think we accidentally did the intro already.

CURTIS:
What? What??

JOEL:
I'm not sure. We greeted everyone. It felt introductory.

CURTIS:
Damn it. Maybe that was the pre-intro?

JOEL:
Is there a pre-intro on the list?

CURTIS:
I can't read it. It's dark.

JOEL:
Let's just keep going.

CURTIS:
We're already deviating from the list?

JOEL:
Just this once. Let's go to the first sketch.

CURTIS:
They're gonna know! They're gonna know!

JOEL:
They don't know. They don't even have a copy of the list.

CURTIS:
They can hear us.

JOEL:
No. The lights are down.

CURTIS:
Good point.

JOEL:
OK, let's move into the positions that we're in at the beginning of the first sketch. And don't forget to place any props that you might use in the sketch.

CURTIS:
OK, mom.

JOEL:
Don't disrespect me. Or your mother.

CURTIS:
OK. And then when the lights come up, we'll just start doing the sketch, right?

JOEL:
Right.

CURTIS:
OK.

JOEL:
OK, bye.

CURTIS:
Next time I see you, I'll be saying the words that we wrote down earlier as the script of the first sketch.

JOEL:
OK, bye.

CURTIS:
I just don't want you to think I'm acting weird.

JOEL:
OK. Bye.

CURTIS:
Bye!

JOEL:
Bye!

CURTIS:
Are you waving goodbye or just saying it? I can't see you. Would you like me to wave?

JOEL:
GODDAMMIT!

CURTIS:
OK, bye!


[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TAKING A BREAK. They are drinking liquor, soda, and lime juice separately. ]
 
ONE:
Finally, it's break time.
 
TWO:
Yes, we may now temporarily discontinue our labors and relax in the manner of our choosing.
 
ONE:
Tell me, when you're not working a rivet gun and securing girders what do you do? 
 
TWO:
Well, when I'm not here performing my duties I am involved in any number of fun activities. You?
 
ONE:
I have ideas.

TWO: 
You mean, you have thoughts? You have things occur to you that are original and unique and unique to the topic you're thinking about?

ONE: 
Yeah, yeah ideas. I have ideas.

TWO: 
Oh yeah? What kind of ideas?

ONE: 
Okay. What if there was a guy who came to your house and took your trash away?

TWO: 
You mean, one would say amass garbage in a bin or can of some kind. Once that's full, you'd say take outside? Out front of your home and leave it there? And then someone would just come by and dispose of it for you?

ONE: 
Yeah, yeah, and they'd take it all to one place, everyone's trash would go to one place.

TWO: 
So this person would pick up your trash, your neighbor's trash and take it somewhere and say dump it? In a designated dumping area?

ONE: 
Yeah and they'd charge you to do this. And they'd also charge you to go to the place where you took your trash and then you could look through other people's trash.

TWO: 
Hmmmm. You're right, that is an idea. Got any other ideas?

ONE: 
Lemme see. What about if you notice the hair on your head is getting long you should be able to go somewhere and have someone do something about that.

TWO: 
So you're saying my hair would grow to the point where I would be dissatisfied with the length or perhaps realize that it's out of style and I would go to a place dedicated to restyling and shortening hair?

ONE: 
Yeah, that's right.

TWO: 
No one is going to volunteer to style and cut other people's hair.

ONE: 
Nonononononono, that's not what I mean at all! You misunderstand me. You would pay them in exchange for their services.

TWO: 
Oh! Oh okay, now I see. And they've got all the instruments that they would need to perform this task right there with them. You don't have to bring anything, you don't need your own scissors or razor?

ONE: 
No, they've got it all there.

TWO: 
What about a brush or a comb.

ONE: 
Nope, nope, they got it. 

TWO: 
I wouldn't want a brush or a comb run through my hair that had been run through someone else's.

ONE: 
Oh, they would sterilize them between uses.

TWO: 
Sounds like you got this all figured out.

ONE: 
Like I said, I got ideas. Lots of ideas.

TWO: 
Got any more?

ONE: 
Yeah, yeah, I do.

TWO: 
Hit me.

ONE: 
Okay, say you're at home and you want a mixed drink or you just want someone to get a beer for you from the fridge.

TWO: 
Sounds nice.

ONE: 
Okay okay okay okay okay okay....say you go to a place where they will mix a drink for you, and others who might show up, or fetch a beer from the fridge for you.

TWO: 
So you're saying I would say what I wanted say a mixture of some sort of liquor, liqueur, spirits and some sort of soda, a fizzy carbonated beverage. And say I'd say "Say, could you mix me up a little bit of X and a little bit of Y and throw in a dash of Z while you're at it and then maybe one of those things cause it's just that kind of night." And then this person would say tend to this request.

ONE: 
Right right.

TWO: 
And maybe there'd be some sort of common lexicon, something, I don't know, like names for the combinations so I wouldn't have to list every ingredient every time.

ONE: 
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, that's right, yeah.

TWO: 
And the person taking my order would know the ingredients that are in that type of drink. Maybe there are schools or training available to teach such things.

ONE: 
Yeah, yeah, totally, totally.

TWO: 
And then if you're not feeling like having a liquor or a liqueur or a spirit, maybe I just say give me one of those brewed beverages you have in that fridge over there.

ONE: 
That's the idea.

TWO: 
But how could they afford to give out drinks? I mean when I stock my liquor cabinet or buy beer for my fridge, it's not free.

ONE: 
Well, I mean, you'd pay them for the drinks and you'd also pay them for the energy they expended preparing or fetching that drink for you.

TWO: 
You got this all figured out.

ONE: 
I got more I got more.

TWO: 
Okay, one more.

ONE: 
What about people who sit and brainstorm together or maybe separately, and come up with ideas for occupations, jobs, things people can do to make other peoples' lives simpler.

TWO: 
So a couple people who just sit around, kind of bounce ideas off each other. Say, one person would present an idea or thought and the other might expand on it? Say, flesh it out? 

ONE: 
Right right, yeah like that.

TWO: 
That sounds kinda boring. Who would want to do that?

ONE: 
I don't know. I just don't know.

[ Long long pause ]

TWO:
Hey, that's kinda what we're doing right now.

[ LIGHTS OUT BOOM! ]


[ LIGHTS UP. A man stands wearing a baseball cap and baseball mitt. He is holding a pack of Big League Chew with his mitt. ]

MAN:
“You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.” Those were the dying words of my father, y’all. He played baseball professionally. It was baseball that eventually killed him. I’m sorry a baseball. A baseball killed my father. He choked on it. My father spent a good portion of his retirement trying to swallow baseballs, you guys. His last words were very difficult to understand.  I loved my father. I’m sorry, I liked my father. I love baseball.

[ He chews a pinch of gum. ]

I love baseball so much. I love watching baseball, playing baseball, and talking about watching and playing baseball, y’all. I once talked about baseball for the longest time, you guys. It was, like, non-stop. I timed myself. I clicked the stop watch and just started talking. And when I ran out of things to say it was thirty-six hours later. My mom says I got baseball in the blood somethin’ awful. Because I do. I literally have a baseball in my blood. I ground a baseball into a fine powder and injected it into my bloodstream. For no reason. I just did it, you guys! Like I said, I love baseball.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Did you know that baseball has a beautiful and rich history? Soldiers of the American Revolution played baseball y’all, like, all the time, you guys. It wasn’t the same exact game that we play today, but it was pretty damn close. December 25th 1776. Christmas Day, y’all. The Battle of Trenton. The American and British soldiers put down their muskets, climbed out of their trenches, and played a game of baseball y’all. We won and went on to face the Germans in a soccer match in World War I.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I would go to all of my dad’s games. I’d cheer him on and watch him treat women in a way that led to a lot of sexual confusion in my adult life, you guys. If a woman isn’t clearly interested in my advances within the first ten seconds of conversation I curl into the fetal position and ask her to pet my head. Isn’t that weird, you guys? I think so, but I can’t help it, y’all. It’s like breathing or goin’ to the bathroom. It comes naturally.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. His cheek is bulging from the gum and it is getting more difficult to understand his speech. ]

I’m also a natural on the field, you guys. I hardly ever practice, y’all, but when my friends get together for a quick game at the park I’m easily the fourth or fifth best. My coordination isn’t that good, so I can’t really catch, hit, run, or throw, but I can tell where a ball is going or what it’s going to do before it has any idea.

[ He chuckles to himself. ]

I’ll yell, “It’s heading for left field, y’all!” or, “You guys, I can feel it. He’s gonna bunt.” They start screamin’ at me that I need to keep my mouth shut, and if they wanted my help they would have let me play in the first place. My friends are great, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Sometimes they do let me play, and I like to think that when I step out on the field that I am in some way connected with the men who fight for my right to step out on said field. You know, the real every-day-heroes who are out there doin’ what they do day in and day out. Like firefighters and garbage men. Every time I see a fireman or a city sanitation department employee I say, ”thanks for baseball, y’all.” They kinda look at me real weird like they’re thinking, ”Finally. Someone said it.”

[ He chews another pinch of gum. He spits with every word due to the amount of gum. It is now too large to keep in one cheek. ]

I just love this game.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I mean, I love everything about it.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

The smells, the sounds, the tight white pants. Everything.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I also love this gum, y’all. I started playing baseball y’all when I was a kid, and since then have developed a serious addiction to Big League Chew. I chew it all the time, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

My physician and my dentist have begged me to quit The Chew. They kept tellin’ me that my teeth are near the final stages of decay and my kidneys will soon give out. I told them if they try to take away my Chew again I’d do somethin’ nasty. They tried and I kept my promise. I made some signs with poster board, glitter, and marker.

[ He pulls out a sign that says “these guys are bad doctors” and one that says ”honk if you hate Dr. Maxwel and hope his family gets sick.” ]

I warned them, you guys.

[ Lights out. ]


NPR SHOCK JOCKS



[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO DJs, SITTING ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF A DESK WITH MICROPHONES SET UP. SOFT JAZZY MUSIC. A VOICEOVER PLAYS. ]

V/O:
You're listening to 103.7, Nucksua County Public Radio.

[ LOUD SOUND EFFECTS OVERLAID. (Austin Powers quotes, engine noises, lasers, thunder, Borat quotes, Dave Chappelle quotes, explosions. ]

And now, we return you to Morning Vibes, with Richland DeMorlan and The Bone Diggity Daddy.

[ DAVID LEE ROTH SCREAM. ]

RICHLAND:
Good morning and welcome to Morning Vibes. This is Richland DeMorlan. I want to start by saying thanks to everyone who participated in last week's pledge drive. Generous community support is how we keep great radio free.

BONE:
Now if I could only get some great sex for free.

RICHLAND:
You may guess from that outrageous comment that with me as always this morning is a man who needs no introduction...

BONE:
Give me one anyway.

[ They chuckle politely. ]

RICHLAND:
That's right, folks, The Bone Diggity Daddy is in the house.

[ BARKING SOUNDS. ]

BONE:
I'm all up in it, Richland. Same way I was with your mom, last night, during intercourse.

RICHLAND:
Bone, please. Oh my.

BONE:
I'm kidding, of course. Your mother is a lovely woman.

RICHLAND:
Well, I like her.

[ The chuckle politely. ]

In addition to our treasured individual supporters, there are a number of pledges from local businesses we'd like to acknowledge. The law firm of Grassley and Sprunt --

[ AL PACINO: "THIS WHOLE SYSTEM'S OUT OF ORDER!" ]

-- Morty's Famous Original Deli --

[ WEIRD AL YANKOVIC: "EAT IT EAT IT EAT IT" ]

-- and, of course, big new sponsor this year --

BONE:
Not exactly a local business, Rich.

[ They chuckle politely. ]

RICHLAND:
No, but we're happy to have their support, so a big thanks to the folks over at Clear Channel Radio.

[ "YABBA-DABBA-DOO!" ]

BONE:
It's nice to see a big corporation with an interest in supporting local public media, Rich.

RICH:
It is, isn't it?

BONE:
It's actually getting the Bone Daddy a little hard.

RICH:
Uh-oh, here we go. Of course, we'll be giving thanks to our additional business sponsors throughout the program.

BONE:
All right Rich, why don't we get to the good stuff? The Bone Diggity's starting to go a little soft --

RICH:
Oh, dear.

BONE:
-- if you know what I mean.

RICH:
Oh, I do, Bone, I do. We've got a great edition of Morning Vibes for you today. Of course, all the music you love. We'll also have a guest in studio with us ... we always love it when this guy comes around. Harris Silverman, he's a professor of ethnomusicology from State University, he'll be here to talk with us about Celtic jazz and Tuvan throat singing.

[ SFX: TUVAN THROAT SINGING, RECORD SCRATCH, "I'M RICK JAMES, BITCH!" ]

BONE:
You know, I once hired a woman for sex, and I tell you, she was quite the amateur throat singer herself.

RICH:
Uh-oh.

BONE:
I guess it was just humming. If you catch my drift.

RICH:
Oh, there you go Bone, pushing that envelope.

BONE:
I'd rather lick the stamp.

[ He makes pantomimes cunnilingus very politely. ]

RICH:
Well, once again folks, thankfully, we don't have a camera in here, or we could be in some real trouble.

BONE:
That's right, Rich. You listeners are in for a treat, because we're going to have some ladies in the studio. We're going to do the Boneyard Obstacle Course with them, you know, just have some fun.

RICH:
That sounds like fun.

BONE:
Oh, and they'll be wet T-shirts, so you folks at home, fellas especially, go ahead and feel free to picture that with your minds. Might get you a little excited, but don't worry, that'll be our little secret, fellas.
 















V/O:
Tired of boring radio?

[ "MAD AS HELL" SOUND EFFECTS. ]

[ "GAME OVER, MAN"
EMINEM


[ A bartender and a customer. ]

CUSTOMER: Can I get a drink?

BARTENDER: Yeah, I think we can arrange that.

[ She hands him a menu. ]

BARTENDER: What’ll you have?

[ He starts looking the menu over, painstakingly. ]

CUSTOMER: Ummmmm … perhaps a beer … or a glass of wine, maybe … no, no … maybe actually a glass of liquor, one of the liquors that you have … no, no, no. Hmmm. Maybe I’ll try--

[ These lines go very quickly. ]

BARTENDER: No.

CUSTOMER: One of--

BARTENDER: Please no.

CUSTOMER: Your--

BARTENDER: Don’t.

CUSTOMER: Cocktails. I’m sorry?

BARTENDER: Nothing. OK, cocktail. Which one?

CUSTOMER: Which one do you like?

BARTENDER: I’m vegan.

CUSTOMER: Oh. Huh. I like the looks of this one.

[ He points. ]

BARTENDER: I can’t see what you’re pointing at.

CUSTOMER: It’s called “Offer You Can’t Refuse”. I like the name of it, which is a line from a movie that I’ve seen. I don’t know what any of these ingredients are, but I assume that if I like The Godfather and I like that line from The Godfather, this cocktail will be reflective of that experience.

BARTENDER: We can only hope.

CUSTOMER: However, I’m going to go ahead and ask about these ingredients anyway, just to be sure.

BARTENDER: Great.

CUSTOMER: First, what is “sage”?

BARTENDER: It’s a promise whispered into the knothole of a tree.

CUSTOMER: What is “aromatic bitters”? 
BARTENDER: It’s extract of an old man’s urine.

CUSTOMER: What is “orange peel”?

BARTENDER: It’s the hook from ABBA’s “Gimme Gimme Gimme A Man After Midnight”.

CUSTOMER: Finally, what is “vodka”?

BARTENDER: Ice.

CUSTOMER: And what does “served on ice” mean?

BARTENDER: That’s a typo. It should say, “no longer available.”

CUSTOMER: Well, that’s a shame. Perhaps I’ll try the “One Word: Plastics”, another line I enjoy from a movie that I enjoy--in this case, The Graduate. Have you seen The Graduate?

BARTENDER: No. I’m vegan, and Dustin Hoffman is an animal.

CUSTOMER: It looks like this drink has both “champagne” and “gin.” Is that really allowed?

BARTENDER: Not really, but we have a saying in this bar, “We killed God; now madness prevails.”

CUSTOMER: Is this a stirred drink? I care and think a lot about how things are combined with each other.

BARTENDER: I give it a quick little back-and-forth with my naked finger, which is part of the charm.

CUSTOMER: Will it be fizzy? My doctor told me to avoid fizz. The slightest bit of fizz gives me literal nonstop diarrhea for a month.

BARTENDER: I think you should try something else.

CUSTOMER: Hmmmm. Hmmmmmm.

BARTENDER: Pick anything. Please. Please. Please, God. Please just pick anything.

CUSTOMER: Now, see, here’s one that looks promising that’s called “Use The Force.” But I don’t recognize that as a line from a movie.

BARTENDER: They’re not all lines from movies. The owner wanted them all to be lines from movies, but when the time came to watch movies or to look them up on the internet, he lost his nerve. So now, some of the cocktail names are just things that real people like to say, like “Use The Force.”

CUSTOMER: It’d be a big leap for me to order this, you know?

BARTENDER: From the minute we began interacting with each other, I could tell you were a brave person.

CUSTOMER: I am. I’ll have a “Use The Force”, please.

BARTENDER: Coming right up.

[ She leans down, then rears back up in surprise. ]

BARTENDER: My god. It’s all gone. The liquor. The ice. The glasses. All the other … stuff. Even the bar itself. All gone.

CUSTOMER: Huh!

BARTENDER: My mentor told me this day would come. It comes for every bartender, they say … All the accoutrement of my trade have ascended to heaven and left me all, all alone.

CUSTOMER: Geez, I’m sorry.

BARTENDER: What the fuck good does that do me? “I’m sorry”? I’m sorry your mother had a stupid moron idiot with a fat ass for a son.

CUSTOMER: Thank you for saying that.

BARTENDER: I used to enjoy this job, you know. This used to be a place of laughter and good cheer. Before the cocktail menu. Before that fucking cocktail menu.

[ She snatches it from his hands. ]

BARTENDER: [ screaming at the menu ] You ruined everything, you piece of shit! I used to pour beers. Mix a little rum with some Coke. Life made sense. Life was simple. Then you came along. Now I spend all day answering questions from idiots who want to pretend that they’re fancy men!

[ She jabs her finger at customer. ]

BARTENDER: There ain’t nothing fancy about you, get me? You’re just another cheap bum who probably gets his clothes in a monthly box from the internet!

CUSTOMER: Hey!! Stop saying true things about me!!

[ She rips up the cocktail menu. Heaves a great sigh of relief. ]

BARTENDER: I’m sorry. It’s not you, really. It’s the menu.

CUSTOMER: Do you feel better now?

BARTENDER: I do, actually.

CUSTOMER: How about a drink?

[ Bartender gasps in melodramatic surprise. Customer pulls out two glasses and a bottle of Coke. He mixes the coke together with the torn pieces of the cocktail menu. They both take a drink. ]

CUSTOMER: This reminds me of a famous line from a famous movie called “The Bible”.

BARTENDER: When the bar and all its accoutrement ascend to heaven … When the customer becomes the bartender …

CUSTOMER: Then is the dark prince in his tower, watching over the land. All things become their opposite.

BARTENDER: Then it shall be last call for all of humanity. Woe unto those who remain to stack the chairs.

[ This could be the end of the show, calling back to the apocalyptic stuff. ]


[ Two VPs are presenting something to a CEO. It’s basic Powerpoint gobbledygook: charts, graphs, etc. ]

VP 1
So, as we see here, quarterly operating costs as a percentage of overall expenditures are growing at a diminished pace, year-over-year, compared to companies of similar market cap. Now...

[ Switches to next slide. ]

VP 1
We see here that--

CEO
Argh! Hold on. Explain to me exactly what I’m looking at.

VP 2
Well, what we’re trying to show is that shareholder value is being driven by several initiatives to--

CEO
I get it. You went to business school. But you need a lesson about breaking things down for people. Get me?

VP 1
OK.

CEO
So: What am I looking at here?

VP 1
Well … This line is what we’re spending, quarterly, on--

CEO
Gah! Stop. Back up. Break it down.

VP 2
Uh.

CEO
Simplify.


VP 1
This is a graph.

CEO
OK, fine. And so, I care because … why?

VP 2
These are numbers that we’ve turned into pictures.

CEO
OK, I’ll buy that.

VP 1
The picture goes up and down because the numbers are bigger or smaller, respectively.

CEO
Mraaagh! You’re still in the clouds. Cloud university business school. You’re talking numbers and pictures and other things that don’t mean anything to anyone. Do you know how I was able to build a successful company from nothing? By relating to the average customer, which is basically a very stupid baby drooling and shitting and still figuring out basic principles of how the world works.

VP 2
OK. Some things are good when they’re big. Profits are good ... to be big.

VP 1
But some things are good to be small. Like costs.

CEO
That sounds like corporate doubletalk. Some things should be big, others should be small? What?

VP 1
I’m not quite sure how to finesse that message.

CEO
What’s the story, here? People understand stories. They think in stories. They walk around, living their lives, and they’re thinking: Cinderella. They’re thinking The Three Little Pigs. That’s what goes on in the average customer’s head, all day.

VP 2
Sir, this presentation is for shareholders, not customers--

CEO
You know why companies go out of business?

VP1
Issues with senior leadership?

CEO
They stop thinking of the customer for even one second. I think of customers constantly. I can’t stop. I can’t GET THEM OUT OF MY FUCKING HEAD even if I wanted to. So what’s the story? Is it a hero’s journey? Are you gonna save the cat? And what does that even mean, because I sure don’t know.

VP2
Well … profits are the hero.

VP1
Costs are the villain.

VP2
And they’re having a big, well-motivated fight.

CEO
GLORF!! Let’s back up again. You made these pictures on a computer?

VP 2
Yes.

CEO
But now they’re outside of the computer.

VP 1
Yes. We took the pictures from the computer and projected them on to this screen, using light.

CEO
OK, Einstein. Explain to me exactly how the pictures get from the screen, through my eyes, to the inside of my head.

VP 2
It has to do with electricity in your brain, I think?




CEO
Uuuuuurgh! “I think.” “I guess.” I’ve asked five questions and already you’re admitting that you don’t know anything. And I should believe that you know what’s best for the business?

VP 1
It’s just not really our area of experience, sir.

CEO
Agh! If the pictures are moving through my brain, tell me this: Is that why it feels like there’s tremendous pressure in my skull?

VP 2
Sir?

CEO
AAAAAAAAH. If my brain is full of pictures, that’s why it feels like my head could split apart at any minute, right?

VP 1
Actually, I think it’s possible that you have a massive brain tumor.

CEO
Ahh! Possible, huh? Anything’s possible? I swear, you MBAs. You know the words, but you have no idea how to put them in the right order.

[ He dies. ]

VP 1
Is he dead?

VP 2
I think so.

VP 1
Good. I don’t know how much longer I could keep that up.

VP 2
Yeah! “Profits?” “Costs?” Where the fuck did you get that from?

VP 1
I have no idea. That’s some real Dilbert-type shit, right here.


VP 2
This boss character was being so dumb and unreasonable. We’re just trying to muddle  through.

VP 1
Yeah.

VP 2
Just like ol’ Dilbert.

Fishing line tie-curling gag … Overly elaborate set-up, with underwhelming result.
Maybe they have a slide to address all of his questions, even though they can’t keep quite keep up with him. Maybe the slides continue even at the end.

And now, ladies and gentlemen ... We present a terrifying glimpse of humanity's future.  [ WOMAN is dressed in rags, trying to tend a small fire. There is a busted CB radio on a stool, blaring static. ]  [ Suddenly, a distorted human voice on the radio. Woman jumps, grabs the handset. ]  WOMAN [ into handset, desperately ] Hello? Is someone out there? Anyone? Do you read me? We are survivors. We have a small encampment east of the flaming river. Coordinates 30.338418, negative 97.806951. Is that right? I don't know if there's a correct way to say coordinates besides just saying them. I was an ordinary person before everything went wrong. I liked to do sudoku. Hello? Do you have food? Help us! Do you need help? We could help you, maybe? I don't know. I took lots of improv classes. Now, it seems so foolish ... but at the time they really helped me to feel more spontaneous and "in the moment." Those were great skills for me as a social media marketing consultant. An ordinary social media marketing consultant. Back then. Help us! Hello? Hello?  [ Nothing but static. She hits the radio, returns to her work. ]  [ After a beat, MAN enters, also dressed in rags. He has some kind of shitty makeshift spear. The woman stares at him hopefully. He shakes his head. ]  MAN Nothing. No rabbits. No squirrels. They're all gone.  WOMAN They can't all be gone.  MAN Their food has dried up. Their bones are scattered in the dust. Even the insects are making their way north.  WOMAN No ...  MAN The darkness is closing in. The soil has turned to ash. The flaming river teems over its banks. No living creature will survive this. Only regret will live.  WOMAN We can't live on regret.  MAN We can't live.  WOMAN The past is past. That world we knew ... It's dead. We must go on, somehow.    MAN When I think about it ...  WOMAN You can't think about it. You mustn't. The past is gone, like tears in a flaming river.  MAN I can't stop thinking about it.  WOMAN You have to.  MAN I can't! When I think ... that we all ... cared so much about Game of Thrones ...  WOMAN NO! Don't say it. Don't say the words.  MAN The words are burnt into my brain. I see them every time I close my eyes!  WOMAN Those years we spent caring about Game of Thrones ... We cannot change them now. There is no atonement we can make.  MAN I mean, Jesus, what were we thinking? What were we all thinking? Putting that at the center of the culture for more than a decade? This dungeons and dragons bullshit? We thought that that was important?  WOMAN It was a terrible mistake, but we can't change it now! Why must we waste our grief?  MAN Because! I actually cared, you hear me? I cared about what was going to happen with those dragons. I was a grown man, thirty years old, with all the treasures of history and culture open to me! And yet I spent ten years wondering, frequently, "I wonder what's going to happen with those dragons."  WOMAN It was an entertaining show. Suspenseful. And, in a way, it was ... uh, like, a kind of inversion of our actual medieval history? Like, you could read it as a critique of nostalgic romance and chivalry as it is often depicted in the fantasy genre. So, it was kind of a smart show, in a way...  MAN You don't even believe these lies you speak.  WOMAN I must make myself believe.  MAN We just wanted to see what was going to happen with these dumb characters. All these dumb characters. "Look, another guy with a messed-up hand." "Oooh, I bet that guy's a wizard." "What do you think that lady has in her bag." We wondered for years. And--  WOMAN Don't say it. Don't speak of it.  MAN Sometimes I think I just liked all the nudity.  WOMAN You must forgive yourself!  MAN How can I forgive myself? When the show was off the air, I used to read set reports. I would share casting rumors with friends! It was the only way we still had to relate to each other, to find some common ground. Friends! People with whom I had once laughed and loved, had watched the sun come up together after a long night ... And now all we could do was talk about the dragon show, while the world around us crumbled.

WOMAN
No!

[ Slaps him. She keeps coming after him to slap him more and more, eventually wrestling him to the ground. ]

WOMAN [ as she keeps slapping him ]
Snap out of it! It was a good show! It was perfectly fine to pass the time! You're overthinking it!

[ She keeps slapping him until she gets exhausted, starts weeping, rolls off of him. He pulls himself up. ]

MAN
And look, I'm not even going to get started about the books.

WOMAN
No. No. You mustn't.

[ She sighs. ]

WOMAN
I miss many things from before. The laughter of children. I miss the taste of clean water. The smells of flowers, before all the flowers died. I miss the way that I would awkwardly avoid eye contact with strangers instead of immediately engaging every stranger in a desperate fight to the death. I miss eating those dark chocolate sea salt caramel things instead of feasting every night on the flesh of strangers that I killed during the day. And yes, I miss getting really into some stupid TV show just because everyone else is into it even though, yes, it kind of seems like it might be kind of stupid.

[ She puts a hand on his shoulder. ]

WOMAN
Those moments ... when you were caring about what would happen with the dragons ... You must hold on to those memories. In a way, that was when you were most human.

MAN
I wish I could believe it.

WILD MAN [ voice offstage ]
You there!

[ MAN and WOMAN both pick up weapons, assume defensive posture. ]

WOMAN
Who goes there!

[ WILD MAN enters with a plastic bag. ]

WILD MAN
I come as a friend, with jerky for all.

[ They put their weapons down. ]

MAN
Pass.

WILD MAN
I am glad there are still some here who follow the ways of civilization. May I rest my feet briefly here?

WOMAN
You may.

WILD MAN
Soooooo ... Do you guys think Adnan did it?

WOMAN and MAN murder WILD MAN


[ Courtney onstage. Curtis enters. ]

COURTNEY [ cheerfully ]
Hello! Welcome to the Soul of Scare-o-ween. Not affiliated with the Spirit of Halloween.

CURTIS
Hi. I’m looking for a costume.

COURTNEY
Please speak into the mic, sir.

CURTIS
Oh. OK. I’m looking for a costume.

COURTNEY
No doy, idiot.

CURTIS
What was that?

COURTNEY
Excuse me?

CURTIS
Did you say something?

COURTNEY
Did you?

CURTIS
Hold on a second. I’m immediately getting the vibe that this is one of those “funny” stores.

COURTNEY
I’m not sure what you mean.

CURTIS
I’m always going into stores that are similar to some other place everyone is familiar with, but instead of getting what I want, I get frustrated and humiliated.

COURTNEY
That’s awful, sir. This is not that kind of place. This is a legitimate seasonal purveyor of affordable all-in-one Halloween costumes and accessories.

CURTIS
Good. I need a costume for an office party. Something simple … zombie, vampire, whatever.

COURTNEY
How about something a little outrageous?

CURTIS
No, honestly, I hate costume parties, but I have to pretend to be a good sport. So, just … whatever. Frankenstein, the mummy, whatever’s easy.

COURTNEY Got it.

[ Courtney turns around, pretends to rummage, picks up a bag and hands it to Curtis. ]

COURTNEY
This is an all-in-one Batman costume. Cape, cowl, the whole deal.

CURTIS
Perfect.

COURTNEY [ pointing ]
Dressing room’s right there.

CURTIS
OK.

[ He goes into the dressing room (exits just offstage). ]

CURTIS
Hey!

COURTNEY
Oh yeah. Sorry about that. The bulb burnt out.

CURTIS It’s pitch dark.

COURTNEY
Just put it on and step out, sir.

CURTIS
I don’t know, this is awfully funny.
COURTNEY [ pulling her phone out and approaching the wings ]
Do you mind? If I get a photo for the store’s Instagram page? It’s something we’re trying to do…

CURTIS
OK, I think I’m all changed. Let me just step out and … hey!

[ Courtney peeks her head and phone offstage and takes a picture, with flash. She comes back onstage, fiddles with her phone as though posting it online. ]

CURTIS
What the fuck?? Hold on, I’m putting my clothes back on….

[ Curtis re-enters. ]

CURTIS
That was not a Batman costume.

COURTNEY
One moment.

CURTIS
Wait! Do not post that.

[ SLIDE 1: Instagram post of a man wearing a horrible “Mexican” costume: panco, sombrero, moustache … the works. ]

CURTIS
What are you doing??

COURTNEY
It’s something we’re trying to do. Social promotion and engagement. Hold on, I’ll tag you. What’s your handle?

CURTIS
Do not tag me!!

COURTNEY
You look cute!

CURTIS
I do not look cute! I look like an offensive moron.


COURTNEY
I disagree. It’s a throwback to a more innocent time.

CURTIS
It’s completely unacceptable.

COURTNEY
Well, I can’t delete it. You can’t delete things on Instagram.

CURTIS
Look, I’m upset, but I’m going to give this one more try, probably two. Give me that Batman costume.

[ He gives her the bag, she turns around and pretends to rummage, returns the bag. ]

COURTNEY
This is definitely the Batman costume.

CURTIS
Good. I’m a busy man and I’m not looking inside.

[ He returns to the dressing room. ]

CURTIS
Argh! It’s so dark.

[ Courtney returns to the side. ]

CURTIS
OK, it’s on. Now to step out and take a look--HEY!

[ Courtney takes a photo, returns to center stage to post it. Curtis steps out. ]

CURTIS
Now, look--

[ SLIDE 2: Instagram post of an anti-Semitic “rich jew” cartoon from Nazi Germany. ]

CURTIS
Do not post that! That was not a Batman costume!


COURTNEY
It’s a Bruce Wayne costume. “Wealthy industrialist.”

CURTIS
It is not! It’s a Nazi cartoon!!

COURTNEY
Great costume, though. You really look like a drawing. With a background and everything!

CURTIS
It’s an amazing costume, but that’s not the--

COURTNEY
What’s your Instagram handle?

CURTIS
@ZoombaKing82. Hey! Do not--

COURTNEY
You can’t untag people on Instagram, sir.

CURTIS
Listen. For complicated, personal reasons, I’m going to give this one last chance.

COURTNEY
One moment, sir. Some idiot on Instagram is wearing disgusting, offensive costumes. I’m going to tell him to fuck off and share the photo on Facebook so other people can tell him to fuck off, too.

CURTIS
Please just give me the Batman costume.

[ Courtney rummages, gives him a bag. ]

CURTIS
I’ve got a good feeling about this one.

[ He heads to the dressing room. Courtney follows him to right outside. ]

CURTIS
I can’t see a thing in here!

COURTNEY
The bulb burnt out!

CURTIS
All right, it’s on. Now, to step into the light and confirm that this is in fact the Batman costume that--WHAT THE FUCK??

COURTNEY [ screaming as she takes photo ]
Social media promotion and engagement!!

[ SLIDE 3: Batman costume. ]

[ Curtis re-enters. ]

COURTNEY
What’s the problem? That was the Batman costume.

CURTIS
I just … I just really thought there was gonna be a third one.

COURTNEY
A third what?

CURTIS
Forget it.


[JOEL is on a date with a WOMAN.]

JOEL: So, yeah, after college, I worked a lot of odd jobs for a while. Jumping from one thing to another, you know?

WOMAN: Sure. I know how it is.

JOEL: Yeah, I did some telemarketing and some door-to-door stuff selling knives. Pizza. I was gonna do a website. Something with videos, or maybe funny pictures of seals. But that never panned out.

WOMAN: Oh, man, videos. I rushed into Peace Corps right out of college, and then I had the crazy idea about making a documentary in Thailand, but it wasn't quite right for me. I mean, Thailand is great obviously -- the people are so hospitable -- but I felt like I wasn't expanding my horizons enough, because I already spoke Thai, you know? So taught music in El Salvador for a while, in the rural schools, you know, guitars, drums. We also had the students do a little theater, which I think was valuable for them, you know, taking command of their own narratives, and fun for me, of course, but I started thinking that all this wandering the world was an indulgence. Like, a touristy thing. So I moved to Memphis and started doing community outreach. You know, drug rehabilitation, work programs, getting them secondhand sweaters for the winter, stuff like that. And that was how I started --

[Joel's phone rings.]

JOEL: One second.
 
[He takes it from his pocket, checks it, grins, and puts it to his ear.]

JOEL: Hello, this is Joel.... No, I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong number. This is 555-5555.... Oh, it's no problem. Have a nice evening.

[He hangs up.]

WOMAN: Wrong number?

JOEL: Wrong number.

WOMAN: Ah. So, anyway, after Memphis I took an interest in teaching Cherokee reservation kids about diabetes --

[Joel is still grinning, smugly.]

JOEL: I think I handled that pretty well, huh?

WOMAN: Pardon?

JOEL: I was brief but considerate. Didn't waste his time but didn't act like he had wasted mine.

WOMAN: You mean the wrong number?

[Joel's phone rings again.]

JOEL: Excuse me.

[He takes it out, checks it, answers.]

JOEL: Hello, this is Joel.... Yes, I'm afraid you do have the wrong number. This is 555-5555.... Yes, I suppose what happened is that, in your haste, you pressed the five button rather than the six. An error anyone could make. Don't give it another thought.... Enjoy the night.

[He hangs up. Still grinning.]

WOMAN: Another?

JOEL: Yes.

WOMAN: That's odd.

JOEL: I suppose. But really, it's my pleasure. I take great satisfaction in it.

WOMAN: In getting wrong numbers.

JOEL: You see, if I don't recognize the number, I always say "Hello, this is Joel." I use my first name. If it's a wrong number, the other caller knows immediately. That saves them from the embarrassment of mistakenly jumping straight into a conversation.

WOMAN: That is very nice, I suppose.

JOEL: And then I state my number. Again, I don't wait for them to ask. Some people don't ask. Maybe they're bashful. But they really should know, so they can determine whether they actually have the wrong number or they mis-dialed.
 
WOMAN: So, you have a system.

JOEL: Oh, you can't do it without a system. Then, I just try to end the interaction gracefully. No need to pretend that we're suddenly friends, of course. But there's no reason two strangers can't exchange good wishes, right? The world isn't yet so sick and cynical that I can't say that I truly do wish every wrong number a pleasant evening?

WOMAN: Um. I'm sure that's possible, yeah. I mean, you're right. Absolutely. You really handled that well. 

JOEL: So, you were saying?

WOMAN: The reserva --

[Joel's phone rings.]

WOMAN: Come on.

[Joel holds a finger up, takes phone out, checks it, flips it.]

JOEL: Hello, this is Joel -- am I the intended recipient of this call?... I'm sorry to hear that. This number is 555-5555, is that in fact the number you attempted to dial?... Perhaps it would be best to check it again, then.... Very sensible.... No, no, no, I won't hear it! Who's to say that I'm not wrong for having this number? Be well. May God light his grace on all your travels.

[He hangs up.]

WOMAN: How many wrong numbers do you get?

JOEL: About two dozen per day. Sometimes it's children. Those ones always feel special. 

WOMAN: Wow. So, anyhow --

JOEL: I'm sorry, am I boring you?

WOMAN: Yes and no.

JOEL: Someone who dials a wrong number is in a vulnerable position. They feel worthless. "You fool! You idiot!" They need gentleness, and caring, and information.

WOMAN: Perhaps I should go.

JOEL: Perhaps you should!

[She leaves. Pause. Joel takes his phone out, dials a number, puts it to his ear.]
 
JOEL: Hello, girl who I was just on a date with? ... FUCK YOU!!!

COURTNEY:
Ladies and gentlemen.

JOEL:
Guys and gals.

COURTNEY:
Boys and girls.

COURTNEY:
Males and females.

JOEL:
Spermatazoa creators and receivers.

COURTNEY:
I think that’s enough.

JOEL:
OK.

COURTNEY:
In fact, that was kind of disgusting.

JOEL:
Sorry about that.

COURTNEY:
Now I’m picturing you creating “spermatazoa.”

JOEL:
And you’re not likin’ it.

COURTNEY:
Not at all.

JOEL:
That’s rough.

COURTNEY:
But it did calm me from my near-unstoppable rage.

JOEL:
You were pretty mad.

COURTNEY:
I’m furious.

JOEL:
I can’t remember why.

COURTNEY:
I do,

[ The cadence resumes ]

JOEL:
Boys and -

COURTNEY [ interrupts and normal speech resumes ]:
- during our research of doughnuts we discovered some very unsettling facts.

JOEL:
Did you know that it is highly suspected that Dutch immigrants introduced doughnuts to America in the sixteen-hundreds?

COURTNEY:
Can you believe a bunch of ___________ gave us the recipe for doughnuts?

JOEL:
It just makes us sick that some stupid ____________,who probably had a million diseases and no steady labor, gave us the recipe for doughnuts.

COURTNEY:
And during our research we found this video.

[ Courtney produces a video tape. ]

Scientists believe that this is authentic footage of a Dutch couple making doughnuts.

JOEL:
At least that’s what that homeless guy wearing a lab coat said.

COURTNEY and JOEL:
Roll film!


[ MICHAEL is sitting at his desk working on his computer. MELISSA enters carrying her lunch. ]

MELISSA [ knocking on the wall ]
Hello?

MICHAEL
Oh! Hi! Hello! Hi.

MELISSA
I’m Melissa? Jordan told me my desk was in here? I’m starting work here today.

MICHAEL
Oh, yes, of course! Melissa! Yes. I’m Michael.

[ MICHAEL extends his hand. MELISSA recoils slightly ]

MELISSA
Oh, yeah…..I’m an introvert.

MICHAEL
What?

MELISSA
I’m an introvert. I’m introverted

MICHAEL
Oh, I…..

MELISSA
So I can’t just…..shake your hand. You have to approach me slowly.

MICHAEL
Slowly?

[ MICHAEL goes in for a handshake in slow motion. MELISSA takes his hand weakly for a moment and then retracts ]

MELISSA
Oh, have you never been taught how to deal with an introvert?

MICHAEL
Oh, yeah, I, uh, got this [ picks up a packet]  Introvert Compliance Handbook but I haven’t had a chance to read it.

MELISSA
Ugh.

MICHAEL
We had a mandatory introvert sensitivity training seminar last month but I was on vacation.

MELISSA
It’s okay, I understand. As an introvert, I have to learn how to deal with living in an extrovert’s world.

MICHAEL
Well, for now, what kind of things do I need to keep in mind?

MELISSA
Well, for instance, when I get here in the morning, I need 45 min to an hour before anyone can say anything to me.

MICHAEL
So you won’t be at the morning meeting?

MELISSA
I’m afraid not. If I have social interaction too soon after arriving, I get over-tired and have to go home for the day.

MICHAEL [ looking through the packet ]
What is all this stuff?

MELISSA
This is a pair of shoe mufflers, this is a protection blanket and this is a breath silencer

MICHAEL
A breath silencer?!

MELISSA
If I hear you breathing in the cubicle next to me, I could literally go into an immediate and irreversible coma. Which reminds me: here is the list of fabrics you can wear around me.

MICHAEL
It just says “Indian-blend rayon”.

MELISSA
Everything else is too “rustly”.

MICHAEL
Uhhhhh…..alright. Well, we get to work …first, I’ll dim the lights to the required [ consults his packet ]….40%.

[ MICHAEL mimes lowering the lights and the actual lights dim. ]

MICHAEL
Is that okay?

MELISSA
Hummm, hmmm, sure.

[ MICHAEL sits in his chair and drags it forward. MELISSA reacts negatively ]

MICHAEL
Sorry….

[ MELISSA looks pained and sits ]

MICHAEL
So I’m going to get started on the database….

[ MELISSA reacts negatively ]

MELISSA
Please, don’t use the active voice. It makes me nervous.

MICHAEL
The...database...needs to be started on…by me.

[ MELISSA looks calm again. ]

MICHAEL
The spreadsheet called….angelfish.drx.mrp...needs to be opened...

MELISSA
We’re gonna have to do something about your cologne.

MICHAEL
My wife bought this for me for our anniversary….

MELISSA
I can’t deal with it.

[ MELISSA takes a baby bottle out of her bag and drinks out of it. ]

MICHAEL
Jesus, what are you doing?

MELISSA
Mid-morning snack. As an introvert I need lots of energy to deal with the extroverted world. Where is your nutrient dispenser?

MICHAEL
I usually just eat my lunch at my desk.

[ MICHAEL takes a sack lunch out of his bag ]

MELISSA
Ooooh, that’s not going to work for me. Smells can trigger….

MICHAEL
That’s not gonna work for YOU?! That’s not gonna work FOR YOU?! I have had the same lunch every day for the last 7 years! I’m not going to change what I eat because…

MELISSA
Someone’s a little set in their ways….

MICHAEL
ME?! I’m set in my ways? So far you have asked me to change what I wear, what I eat, how I BREATHE….all because you’re an introvert? That doesn’t even make sense!

MELISSA
Crowds drain my energy….

MICHAEL
Aren’t you supposed to want to stay home and read? Or just be a little shy? What does food or Indian-blend rayon or shoe mufflers have to do with being an introvert?!

[ MELISSA has started convulsing ]

MICHAEL
Oh god!

MELISSA
Rub my stomach!

[ MICHAEL rubs her stomach clockwise ]

MELISSA
No no! Counter-clockwise! Oh no, it’s too late!

[ MICHAEL gets his water bottle and tries to give water to MELISSA. JORDAN enters ]

MELISSA
Oh god, no! Don’t get me wet!

[ MICHAEL “turns the lights up” ]

MELISSA
Bright Light! Bright Light! Turn the lights off!

[ MICHAEL hits the lights and the stage goes dark ]

MELISSA (demonically)
Bye bye, Billy.

RING WRAITH



[ LIGHT UP ON A WOMAN. She is standing in front of a ring. Her movements are slow and graceful. Her arms never stop moving like she is treading water in slow motion. Man walks by and notices the ring. ]

MAN:
Ma'am, did you drop your ring?


WOMAN: 
Have you any idea how long I've been waiting for a man, a special man to take notice of this ring and return it to me?

MAN:
No. I don't

WOMAN:
An eternity.

MAN:
Okay.

WOMAN:
The man who takes notice of this ring will be no ordinary person, so the prophecy says.

MAN:
Wow. I have been working out.

WOMAN:
And that man and I will fall in love.

MAN:
No kidding.

WOMAN:
And do you know how many people have picked it up?

MAN:
I would have to guess.

WOMAN:
That is fine.

MAN:
Eighteen.

WOMAN:
I have stood idle since the ring was pulled from the great fire, and you guess eighteen.

MAN:
Was that a long time ago?

WOMAN:
Ages ago, before time existed, this ring was forged in the fires burning in the belly of the earth.

MAN:
Really.

WOMAN:
Since its creation I have remained here.

MAN:
Right here?

WOMAN:
On this very spot. Waiting for my true love.

MAN:
Nowhere else? For forever.

WOMAN:
Well, yesterday I took a break and went for a sandwich.

MAN:
Where did you go?

WOMAN:
The Sandwich Hut.

MAN:
Ah, just down the road.

WOMAN:
There's one down the road?

MAN:
One block east, make a left, you're in the door.

WOMAN:
I went to the one on Maple and 10th.

MAN:
That's, like, 15 miles.

WOMAN:
Yes.

MAN:
And yesterday was a scorcher.

WOMAN:
You're telling me.

MAN:
Oh boy. It must have hit a hundred and four at three o'clock yesterday.

WOMAN:
That's about when I passed out.

MAN:
Uh-oh.

WOMAN:
On the way back from Sandwich Hut.

MAN:
Heat exhaustion?

WOMAN:
You know it.

MAN:
Sorry to hear that.

WOMAN:
I awoke in an infirmary.

MAN:
Could have been worse, I guess.

WOMAN:
The attendants thought me to be mad once I regaled them with my life story.

MAN:
You do come off as kind of crazy.

WOMAN:
I waited for my love to come and free me.

MAN:
Let me guess.

WOMAN:
He never came.

MAN:
One hundred seventeen.

WOMAN:
Pardon?

MAN:
That's my guess for how many people have picked up your ring.

[ BEAT ]

Am I way off?

[ BEAT ]

WOMAN:
Yes.

MAN:
I was closer with eighteen, wasn't I.

[ BEAT ]

WOMAN:
Yes. One man other than you has taken notice of the ring and returned it to me.

MAN:
If he found your ring then why are you still here? Shouldn't you two be in love somewhere.

WOMAN:
Do you not want to hear of my escape from the infirmary?

MAN:
You've been talking for a while about your own things. How 'bout I let loose for a minute.

WOMAN:
I was right in the middle of --

MAN:
You know what, I am sick of being bulldozed in conversations by people who are obviously more interesting than me.

WOMAN:
It's almost eight o'clock.

MAN:
People like Cindy at work. She won't stop talking about her two week trip to Europe.

WOMAN:
He'll be here soon. On his way to work.

MAN:
What about my two week vacation?

WOMAN:
Perhaps today is the day he realizes his love for me.

MAN:
I didn't necessarily go anywhere. I spent two weeks at home. That's two whole weeks of adventures that could have happened but didn't.

WOMAN:
Here is is. My heart is alive with possibility.

[ MAN 2 ENTERS carrying a briefcase and a to-go coffee. ]

WOMAN:
Good day, sir. I hope you are in--

MAN 2:
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!

WOMAN:
Would you care to--

MAN 2:
NO I WOULDN'T!

WOMAN:
Perhaps a--

MAN 2:
SHUT UP! I don't like you. I don't know you. I don't want to get to know you. I don't love you. I will never love you. Who's this?
 
MAN:
Oh, hello. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Ra--

MAN 2:
Oh-ho! I see what's going on here. You can't get anything from Papa so you go after the first thing that passes by.

HID SALESWOMAN



[ LIGHTS UP. A SALESWOMAN ENTERS. She is carrying a small box and a brochure. She approaches the door onstage and knocks on it. A MAN ANSWERS THE DOOR. ]

MAN
May I help you?

SALESWOMAN
Hello, sir. You’re interested in a magazine subscription.

MAN
Excuse me?

SALESWOMAN
As long as you’re subscribing to a magazine, why not support a good cause?

MAN
Magazine?

SALESWOMAN
As you know, sir, I’m going door-to-door selling magazine subscriptions. There are over one-hundred magazines that you can choose from, sir. As you know, your subscription will help to support Americans who suffer from Hyperempathic Identification Disorder, or HID. Americans like you and me, sir, as you know.

MAN
You -- hold on, I’m lost.

SALESWOMAN
Take your time, sir. You’re in no hurry.

MAN
I’m not quite sure what’s happening.

SALESWOMAN
Sure you are. I’m selling magazine subscriptions--

MAN
Well, yes, I get that.

SALESWOMAN
Of course you do. There are all kinds of magazines you can subscribe to. There’s Cook’s Illustrated. You want to prepare more meals at home. There’s Travel. You can learn about all the hotspots in South America. Places that you’ve been dying to visit since you were a little girl.

MAN
I’m sorry. I think you may have me confused with someone else.

[ He closes the door. She is undeterred. A brief pause, then she knocks again. He answers the door. ]

MAN
Yes?

SALESWOMAN
Sir, as you know, Hyperempathic Identification Disorder is a serious diseases that affects hundreds of Americans every year. Sufferers of HID like yourself have great trouble functioning in normal society. Even the slightest interaction can be difficult to someone with HID. Someone like you.

MAN
Look, I don’t have HID. At least I’m pretty sure I don’t, because I’ve never heard of HID.

SALESWOMAN
You can also purchase a subscription as a gift, sir. Your Aunt Kathleen sure would love a subscription to one of our music magazines. When you were a young girl, you used to love her crazy stories about her days on the road as an REO Speedwagon groupie.

MAN
I don’t have an Aunt -- what?

SALESWOMAN
Father’s Day is just around the corner. You know how your dad spends hours in the garage painting his Civil War figurines. Why not get him a subscription to Civil War Miniaturist? Only $49.99 a year, a very modest markup.

MAN
My father’s dead.

SALESWOMAN
No, that’s not correct. But while you’re giving gifts, you should also treat yourself. How about Puzzle Enthusiast? Doing a nice Sudoku always helps to clear your mind when you’re feeling despair about your terrible, tragic condition.

MAN
Are you ... all right?

SALESWOMAN
Of course not, sir. You suffer from HID.

MAN
What is HID?

SALESWOMAN
Hyperempathic Identification Disorder, as you know, sir, is the frequent inability to distinguish yourself from others. And vice versa. You’ve been struggling with it all your life. It makes it very difficult for you to relate to other people.

[ Pause. ]

MAN
What the fuck?

SALESWOMAN
Sir, you have a lot of nerve using that language with me when you’re standing outside of my house trying to sell me magazines.

MAN
I’m leaving. Goodbye.

[ He shuts the door. ]

SALESWOMAN
Hey! Get out of my house!

[ Beat. ]

I am such an asshole.

“Yelene and Francois”

[A music video, set in a pedestrian area outside, like a courtyard or a pedestrian mall, shot in black and white that looks all weird shiny like those old TV cameras did. Two dancers enter and do a fairly spastic dance, manically chewing bubble gum. YELENE walks into the shot, she awkwardly mouths the words to the song while walking along a row of people whom she greets, sings to, regards in some way. She walks up to a window and sings into that, looking through her reflection into the camera, turning back and forth to look from the window to the camera. This is interspersed with lots of shots of people chewing huge wads of bubble gum.]

Put it in my mouth
put it in my mouth
put it in my mouth
I’ll chew it up

It’s growing
It’s growing
It’s growing in my mouth
I love it
Bubble gum

Bubble bubble blowing bubble
Blowing blowing blowing
Bubble Bubble bubble

Love Love Love
Gummy Gummy Gummy
Ohhhh, feels so good in my mouth

Sometimes it squirts
Sometimes it doesn’t
I am pregnant
With anticipation

Do not eat it
It is not food
No no no
It goes in your mouth but is not food

It is like toothbrush, mouth guard or straw
Or tongue depressor
Put in your mouth but do not eat
Bubble bubble bubble

It is fun to chew but it is not to eat
It is for your house or in the street
It is for the people that you meet
It is for the sun and sleet
It is for the snowpeople that you meet

My soul is tired
A chew toy for doggies!
That is like gum for doggies
My soul is so tired

Bubble bubble blowing bubble
Blowing blowing blowing
Bubble Bubble bubble

Gum is in a category of retainers and tongue piercings

Love Love Love
Gummy Gummy Gummy
Ohhhh, feels so good in my mouth



These are interjections that will be cut in with the video:

CRITIC
This bubblegum song is the dumbest thing I have ever heard, but it is also, indisputably, the best song in the history of the world.

CRITIC 2
At first listen, the songs of Francois and Yelene may seem like the most insipid pap imaginable. However, on repeated listens, you slowly discover that their music can actually cure physical ailments

PRESENT DAY YELENE
I had no idea, no idea that this song was, how you say, double intended. I simply wanted to sing a song about how much I loved bubble gum. It was my greatest pleasure in life, chewing. I loved to chew. No matter what it is I love to chew! Sausage, baguettes, carrotes, cucumbers! Zucchini! Tube of cookie dough?! Roll of quarters? For someone who loves to chew what is more amazing than bubble gum!

PRESENT DAY YELENE
 I had only ever had 4 sexual partners in my life! I was 13, how was I to know? Sure I had taken men into my mouth but what is a young girl to know of lyrical sexual innuendo in a gum context?

CRITIC
Francois Geront was a drunk. He was a convicted criminal and a noted anti-Semite. His family hated him. His friends hated him. He was a known and despised sex offender. I once had the opportunity to interview him. He poured coffee on my face, and then he slept with my wife. Then he poured coffee on my wife and slept with my face. He was the greatest musical genius of all time. The bastard is better than Bach.

CRITIC 2
Francois Geront murdered my family. My wife, my two kids. He did so knowingly and deliberately. In cold blood. He is my favorite musician.

Now it’s a full on documentary:

CRITIC 1
Yelene and Francoise had a very complex relationship. In one sense it was a classic musician/producer relationship but in another sense it was very much a father/daughter thing. A father/daughter thing where the father makes out with the daughter a lot.

CRITIC 2
They were obviously lovers but more specifically she drew material from him that no one else could. And he from her. They would make love before every take to give it a fresh, fevered quality.

[ YELENE and FRANCOIS in the studio, cuddling on a bean bag. YELENE is the big spoon and FRANCOIS is crying. He abruptly gets up.]

FRANCOIS
Enough! We record now!

[FRANCOIS storms out the door and starts messing with the sound board]

YELENE (present day)
I thought of him as my father, producer, songwriter, god, mailman, trainer, lover, friend, soul mate, grandfather, mother, brother and boss. I hated the man.

[FRANCOIS is in the studio screaming at YELENE who tinkers with a guitar]

FRANCOIS
This is song for pleasure! This is song for love from mouth from woman, young woman! Young woman chew on the gum, young woman for the mouth to give pleasure! That is why I make this song!

[FRANCOIS is sitting on a piano bench, smoking, talking to a technician. YELENE is laying on the piano, smoking]

FRANCOIS
Music to me is for when to see young woman, to make the young woman to come closer. Music is to fish for the young woman, to put the worm, so that the young woman, she say "How is this? I will see." Then the young woman, she is caught. This to me is why for the music.

[ FRANCOIS feeds YELENE a swedish fish ]

First time I listened to it I hated it 2nd time loved it 3rd 4th 5th time I was asleep

Thanks for showing me how a record player works

perhaps he comes back from the dead and has a new song
apologizes and sings a song
critics hate it
food themed song
quinoa
bubble tea


[  LIGHTS UP.  A man sits at a table in a restaurant. He is reading a book. He is obviously confused. A waiter slowly and stealthily approaches. The waiter produces a paper towel tube and lightly touches it to the unsuspecting man’s face. The man swats it away. ]

PATRON
HEY!

WAITER
Hey there.

PATRON
What WAS that?

WAITER
What?

PATRON
What was THAT?

WAITER
My name is Ken, sir. I’ll be your waiter this evening. Can I start you off with a beverage?

PATRON
Water. I drink water.

WAITER
Yes sir.

[ The waiter exits and the man continues reading. The waiter enters and like before he is slow and stealthy. He produces a wrapping paper tube and lightly touches it to the man’s face. The man swats it away. ]

PATRON
HEY!

WAITER
Hey there.

PATRON
What the hell -

WAITER
What did you order to drink, sir?

PATRON
What?

WAITER
Your beverage sir. I forgot your order.

PATRON
I ordered wa -

[ As the man is speaking the waiter touches the tube to the man’s mouth. The man swats it away. ]

HEY!

[ The manager enters. ]

MANAGER
Is there a problem here? I heard yelling.

PATRON
He’s touchin’ my face with stuff. I don’t like it.

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
Is this true?

WAITER
Yes.

MANAGER [ to patron ]
Did you ask him to stop?

PATRON
YES!

WAITER
No he didn’t.

MANAGER [ to patron ]
Is this true?

PATRON
Yes.

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
Please stop touching his face.

PATRON
He was touchin’ my face!

MANAGER
I know, sir.

PATRON
With some cardboard tubes!

MANAGER
I am so sorry, sir. I see that you are without a drink. May we serve you a beverage?

PATRON
I drink water!

[ The manager gestures to the waiter who immediateley exits. ]

MANAGER
Of course, your bill will be taken care of by the restaurant.

PATRON
That’s what I expect for him touchin’ my face with that tubin’.

MANAGER
Is there anything else I can do to make your meal more enjoyable?

PATRON
I wanna read this book.

MANAGER
Very good, sir. I will leave you to it.

[ The manager exits. The waiter, from offstage, lifts several cardboard tubes taped together to make a very long tube, and touches it to the man’s face. ]

PATRON
He’s touchin’ my face again! You asked him not to and he still touched my face.

[ The manager enters. ]

MANAGER [ to waiter ]
What is wrong with you?

PATRON
This time the tube was really long.

MANAGER
I asked you not to do this.

PATRON
He musta had it already put together or somethin’.

[ The manager produces a knife. ]

MANAGER
You leave me no choice.

[ He stabs the waiter over and over. The waiter dies. ]

PATRON
Oh damn!

MANAGER
Please excuse my outburst, sir. Someone will be along shortly to remove the mess.

PATRON
OK.

[ Manager stabs patron. ]


AD BREAK #1

MIKE
A now, folks, a little word from this week’s sponsor, Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts.

RALPH
Now, folks, we don’t have to tell you how delicious these things are.

MIKE
And we won’t.

RALPH [ reading from a card ]
But we’d like to bring you message direct from the company: Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts, now with a secret ingredient. What could it be? I can’t tell you. Oh man! I want to tell you guys what it is so bad. Bozo’s Circus Peanuts, our candy has secrets!

MIKE
That’s exciting.

















AD BREAK #2

RALPH
Once again, folks, if you don’t mind, we’d like to say just a few words about Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts.

MIKE
These things are just fabulous, fabulous to eat.

RALPH
Sure are.

MIKE
Not gross.

RALPH
No, not like you remember. They’re really good.
MIKE [ reading from a card ]
And on their behalf, we’d just like to say: Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts. My boss made me promise I wouldn’t tell anyone the new secret ingredient. He’s such a jerk, so anything I can do to upset him is tempting. Bozo’s Circus Peanuts, I’m really tempted to tell you about our secret ingredient and upset my dumb stupid boss.

RALPH
Great.

MIKE
Yes very specific.









AD BREAK #3
MIKE
It’s that time again, folks.
RALPH
Time to pay the bills.
MIKE
And really, it’s an honor and a privilege to pay the bills when you can do it by spreading the word about Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts.
RALPH
I know what you’re thinking: “Circus peanuts aren’t good. They’ve never been good.”
MIKE
“They’re a kind of candy that nobody likes.”
RALPH
“They hang in clear, generic bags at the grocery store, with a dozen other candies that only exist to remind us that not all candy is good.”
MIKE
Not true.
RALPH [ reads from card ]
No, these are pretty good. And I’m happy to share their message with you. Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts: OK, I’ll level with you guys. You seem like good honest people and you deserve the truth about Bozo’s Circus Peanuts. The secret ingredient is a powerful natural antioxidant that actually counteracts the growth of malignant cancerous cells with 100% effectiveness. It’s a cure for cancer, in other words. Whew, it feels good to let that out. Bozo’s Circus Peanuts, eat them and beat cancer.
MIKE
Bonus.
RALPH
Yeah. how about that?






AD BREAK #4

RALPH
Well folks, we have one last message to share from tonight’s sponsors.

MIKE
I think you should show the people how much we love these circus peanuts.

RALPH
I’d like to, but how?

MIKE [ reading from a card ]
Good point. Bozo’s Marshmallow Circus Peanuts, we apologize for our previous ad and are truly sorry for causing any alarm or false hope. The person responsible for this has been dealt with and our new quality assurance programs will prevent something like this from happening again. We said we had the cure for cancer. That was not true. If you are suffering from any form of cancer you need to seek the treatment of a medical specialist. However, please don’t forget, while you’re in this fight for your life, that circus peanuts are a delicious treat and fun to eat. Bozo’s Circus Peanuts, you can enjoy them even if you have a lot of cancer.

RALPH
That’s a little disappointing.

MIKE
There’s something handwritten in the corner. “You want a real secret? Our company was initially and illegally funded with Nazi gold. Love, Bozo’s.”

RALPH
Now we’re talking.


[ A middle aged married couple is in their New Jersey living room. Trash is scattered on the floor.

The husband:
wearing a stained tank top undershirt, sitting at a table, playing solitaire, drinking a can of beer.

The wife:
wearing tights and a tacky blouse, painting her toenails. She is using those toenail spreader things, her hair is a mess.

We join them mid-squabble. They are obviously upset with each other. The following should be delivered sarcastically. ]


WIFE:
You know what, Craig? You’re doing a great job of making an ass of yourself.

HUSBAND:
A great job, huh?

WIFE:
A helluva job!

HUSBAND:
I’m doing a bang up job, huh?

WIFE:
Oh yeah. The amount of effort you are putting into your work nowadays is very clear.

HUSBAND:
Look at me I’m finally good at one of my jobs I’ve had.

WIFE:
And you are great at this one!

HUSBAND:
You mean being an ass!

WIFE:
You said it. A big ass.

HUSBAND:
I’m so very pleased with myself.

WIFE:
Well, you should be.

HUSBAND:
I feel so accomplished.

WIFE:
Great job, Craig!

HUSBAND:
Why thank you very much!

WIFE:
And you have been at it for a very long time.

HUSBAND:
Then it won’t come as a surprise to hear that I am demanding a raise.

WIFE:
You’re not getting a raise.

HUSBAND:
No?

WIFE:
No.

HUSBAND:
No?

WIFE:
No!

HUSBAND:
But, I have worked so long and so hard at being an ass all this time.

WIFE:
Which is why I am giving you a promotion.

HUSBAND:
Finally, a corner office!

WIFE:
And a raise!

HUSBAND:
Suddenly things are looking up for ol’ Craig.

WIFE:
Looks like you’re hittin’ it big this time!

HUSBAND:
Things are really goin’ for me now, baby!

WIFE:
Hope you don’t forget us little folks down here while you’re assin’ it up with the big brass!

HUSBAND:
Assin’ it up?

WIFE:
Assin’ it all up until you forgot where you came from.

HUSBAND:
Oh, perish the thought. How could I possibly forget people like you who have served as so much inspiration?!

WIFE:
I speak, if I may, on behalf of those so honored to have inspired such a great mind as yourself...

HUSBAND:
You may.

WIFE:
...when I say what a privilege it has been to be a part of something so much bigger than all of us.

HUSBAND:
You are too, kind.

WIFE:
Kind to a fault one might say.

HUSBAND:
One might, yes.

WIFE:
Craig?

HUSBAND:
What?!

WIFE:
Just take out the trash, Craig.

HUSBAND:
OK.

COURTNEY
Folks, we'd like to do a little something special for you today. Not just any sketch, but the very first Your Terrific Neighbors sketch. This sketch was written by my great-grandmother, vaudeville starlet and comic good-time gal Tallulah Hopkin.

CURTIS
It was performed by her alongside her two partners, my great-grandfather, the great "ethnic" comedian, Primo "Chiky-Chiky" Luciani...

ADAM
... and my great-grandfather, Senator Osburn Hilton, "the laughing legislator."

CURTIS
They performed together to great acclaim on vaudeville stages across the nation as the Jolly Next-door Patriot Gang, a tradition passed down through the generations to eventually become the present-day incarnation of Your Terrific Neighbors.

COURTNEY
The original Jolly Next-door Patriot Gang died tragically in 1932 when the opium den they were patronizing together suddenly exploded. With love, we dedicate this sketch to their ghosts: May hell's fires burn a little less hot for them today.

[ Courtney is at a table, sipping from a bottle. Curtis and Adam are talking on the other side of the stage. ]

ADAM
Goodness mercy mercy, there's a fine little fillie of a duckling chickadee!

CURTIS
Why that's Nellie Divine, the loveliest lass, they say, of the great white way.

ADAM
Goodness grapes, Nellie Divine, here in our humble little speakeasy, sipping moonshine from the bottle like she's the salt of the soil! She's a vision. I'm afraid I'll never forgive myself if I don't give her a bit of the old chat-up!

CURTIS
If you do, friend, see that you steer the talking ship clear of a certain conversational iceberg that's knocked many a man's boat to the bottom of the sea!

ADAM
What's that?

CURTIS
There's just one topic that Nelly Divine can't stomach--

ADAM
Huh? What's that?

CURTIS
There's but one subject that sends her into a fit of--

ADAM
What's that now? Hey hey? What what?

CURTIS
If you intend to give her some lip, I'm just saying that there is just this one particular subject--

ADAM
Hoo? Ha ha? What? What's this now?

CURTIS
The merest mention of this subject--

ADAM
What's the time? What's that there?

CURTIS
She'll fly into an immediate and deadly rage--

ADAM
Thank you for the advice, friend! Now hang back and observe a real Boston smoothie in his finest fetter!

CURTIS
I didn't tell you the ...

[ Adam approaches Courtney, sits by her. Curtis heads downstage. ]

CURTIS
My word! The fellow never even let me finish, and now there he is, off to try his charms on Nelly Divine, ignorant and unprotected from the one subject of conversation that always, invariably, without exception sends her into a fit of violent murderous wrath! I pray to Jesus and all the saints that he doesn't accidentally stumble on this single forbidden topic! He probably won't. Oh well. Let's see. I hope this summary has been helpful in getting us all on the same page.

[ Curtis returns to his place. ]

ADAM
Howdy-doo, lovely lass.

COURTNEY
And howdy-doo to you too, my my, you're a slim link of sausage, and such a nice casing, too. I'd like a floor tour of the factory where they filled you up, baby bear. I'd write a muckraker that'd send Upton Sinclair and "The Jungle" packing home on the Atlanta-Pacific.

ADAM
Who do you like for the World Series? I'll bet my bunkhouse on the Brooklyn Dodgers.

[ Before he can even finish the sentence, Courtney screams at the top of her lungs and smashes the bottle on his head. Adam falls to the floor. As Courtney and Curtis continue the sketch, Adam whines and groans in pain on the floor, in disoriented agony. ]

[ Curtis and Courtney continue the sketch. ]

CURTIS
Oh my, friend, that was a tough break! Perhaps a different approach would be...

[ Curtis and Courtney improvise a bunch of dumb vaudeville three-line gags, dancing back and forth between each one. After we’ve milked it sufficiently, Adam dies. Curtis and Courtney do a couple more after he stops making noise, and then…. ]

CURTIS
Hey hey Nelly, what do you think about them Brooklyn Dodgers?

[ Curtis gasps, puts his hand over his mouth. Courtney winds up, as though for a big punch, and then gives a thumbs up. ]

CURTIS
What’s this approval now?

COURTNEY
This thumb in the air’s a gesture of positivity and goodwill, friend! I’m bringing it back from Roman and medieval times to give your buttress a boost!

CURTIS
Well ain’t that grandma’s kneecap! But why’d you deck that fella for stumbling on the same TNT?

COURTNEY
Oh, Brooklyn Dodgers? I thought he said Brooklyn Codgers and I didn’t care for it. A fella should respect his elders. And every previous time that a person said Brooklyn Dodgers, I made the same mistake.

CURTIS Welly-well whoop-da-dee! Take a look at yourselves!

[ Curtis and Courtney take a bow, start sweeping up. Try to sweep up Adam, can’t do it. They pull out a rug and put it over Adam, then pull out a staple gun and staple the perimeter of the rug to the ground. Bow again, shrug, bow again. Exit. ]

[ MUSIC: Sad music. ]

[ GEORGE, wearing a long coat, trudges unhappily to downstage center. He is staring over the edge of a bridge, thinking of jumping. He makes his decision; take his coat off. He begins to pull himself over the railing. ]

[ SOUND: Magical twinkling. ]

[ An angel appears. ]

ANGEL
Going somewhere, George?

GEORGE
Whuh? Hey! No, I just … I mean, who are you?

ANGEL
I’m your guardian angel, George.

GEORGE
Guardian angel? I haven’t got any guardian angel. If I did, my life wouldn’t be a stinking mess, and I wouldn’t be half on my way to throwing myself off a dang bridge.

ANGEL
Point taken, George. But have you thought about what the world would be like without you?

GEORGE
Far as I can see, the world would be just fine. I’m a failure. A total flop. A three-tier turd sandwich. The bank’s gone under. Pretty soon Mary and the kids will know. They’ll know I let them down. No college for Johnny and Little Patty. The only place I can afford to send them is Failure School, and I’m the dean.

ANGEL
That’s a bit much, George. Let me show you something.

[ SOUND: Magical transport sounds. ]

[ SOUND: Cagefighting noises: punches, screams, crowd going nuts. ]

ANGEL
Does this look familiar, George?

GEORGE
Well, heck, of course it does. We’re down at the weekly cage fights. Any fool would know that. Everyone loves the cage fights.

ANGEL
The whole town of Rockdale is here, cheering on their favorite fighters, showing respect for the ones who fall in battle, placing bets on which ones will be permanently injured and which one will walk out tonight wearing the coveted Necklace of Teeth, the sign of a true cage fight champion.

GEORGE
Fine, fine. So why bring me here?

ANGEL
George, don’t you remember when a young Stavros Giorgios came to you, so many years ago? All the big banks had turned him down for a loan, so he came to you with tears in his eyes….

[ Stavros enters, speaks downstage, toward audience. His is a horrible, sleazy looking person. ]

STAVROS
Please, Mr. George, I beg you. I come to this country with a simple dream, a dream to buy a warehouse by the docks and manage illegal bare knuckle brawls. Then, additionally, I have another simple dream, which is to operate drug and prostitution ring on the side, but we need not concern ourselves with that here. Please, Mr. George, please, I beg to you on one knee. Let this dream for me come true.

[ He exits. ]

ANGEL
And what happened then, George?

GEORGE
Well … I gave him his loan, didn’t I? I don’t know. It didn’t seem right, but then I felt like … You know, whatever.

ANGEL
And without this, none of this would be here, George.

GEORGE
Oh, it was just a small loan.

ANGEL
Just a small loan! George, big trees come from little seeds. And this is a very big tree! Look at everyone here. The fighters, the refs, the girls in bikinis who dance in the cage between fights, the blood-wipers, the teeth-collectors, the prostitutes and drug dealers, the trainers, the people who recruit new talent from adolescent group homes … None of this would be here without you.

GEORGE
Well…

ANGEL
Look at him, George. That’s Disaster Montoyez. If none of this had been here, he would have been a pediatrician, helping hundreds of children. Instead, he’s a cage fighter, inspiring thousands.

[ANGEL and GEORGE are being splattered with blood]

GEORGE
I mean, sure this is a sport that inspired many people to be their personal best, inspires children all over the country to reach for the stars. But I didn’t have anything to do with that. The fighters are the real heroes.

ANGEL
But they couldn’t be heroes without your initial heroism.

GEORGE
Still not convinced.

ANGEL
Look at her, George, that’s Tonya Tony. She overcame a successful Olympic career where she represented the United States by medaling taekwondo to be where she is today, completely dominating everyone else in her gender in this noble sport by using the same move in every match.

[ANGEL and GEORGE are pelted with Tic Tacs]

GEORGE
I’m starting to understand.

ANGEL
And look at young Stavros himself. If you had not given him that loan, he would have worked his way through college at his father’s deli, eventually passing the bar and becoming a civil rights attorney, representing victims of police brutality and eventually bringing about reform in police force policies around the country. Thanks to you he has a powerful drug habit that forces him to fix matches to pay off his debts. Stavros is constantly bargaining with loan sharks for his life. “Just give me more time,” he pleads. “I’ll have the money to you by--”

[STAVROS’ head rolls on stage]

GEORGE [picking up the head]
A nobel death.

COURTNEY
Censorship!

JOEL
The hammer of propriety, crushing the spirit of true art.

COURTNEY
Censorship!

CURTIS
The whip of the bourgeoisie, keeping the truth at bay.

COURTNEY
Censorship!

JOEL
Fabreze of comfort and complacency. You can’t make the stink go away, you can only cover it up!

COURTNEY
Censorship!

CURTIS
Censorship is our topic here today.

COURTNEY
Censorship! It’s our topic here today!

JOEL
And my friends, Your Terrific Neighbors are no strangers to censorship.

CURTIS
Hardly.

COURTNEY
But wait, we’re just comedians, right?

JOEL
Just comedians?

CURTIS
Was Lenny Bruce just a comedian?

JOEL
Was D.H. Lawrence just a comedian?

COURTNEY
Was Malcolm X just a comedian?

CURTIS
Was Malcolm Jamal Warner just a comedian?

JOEL
Was Malcolm In The Middle just a comedian?

COURTNEY
Was Martin Luther just a comedian?

CURTIS
Was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. just a comedian?

JOEL
Was Martin Luther King, Sr. just a comedian’s father?

COURTNEY
Was Dr. D.H. Lawrence King, Jr. just a comedian that I just made up?

CURTIS
No! These people were all different things!

JOEL
More things!

COURTNEY
Censorship!

CURTIS
And like these giants, we have been censored in our time.

COURTNEY
Fans of our sketch comedy know that we are no strangers to inflammatory political content, blasphemy, foul language, polymorphous sexuality, loud stinky farts, references to poo-poo and pee-pee, and other so-called hot button issues.

JOEL
And, yes, there have been one or two occasions where we might have crossed the line.

COURTNEY
Whatever that means.

CURTIS
Because who decides where the line is?

JOEL
I never voted on no line.

CURTIS
Me neither.

COURTNEY
Take away this line, President Oblama!

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS
Perhaps the most iconic and vilest form of censorship that we’ve experienced is book burning.

COURTNEY
As depicted in Ray Bradbury’s classic book, Fahrenheit 451.

JOEL
And, also, the Nazis.







"We're going to present a cleaned-up version of one of our most notoriously filthy and transgressive sketches, 'Jesus Christ Visits Hitler the Butt Prostitute'."

"This sketch is so offensive, that we have never been able to complete a performance of it onstage without inciting an audience riot halfway through."

"We were not allowed to perform this sketch even at Amsterdam's highly experimental Groteske Komedie Horror festival, which occurs annually in the basement of a dildo warehouse in the heart of the city's red light district."

"The president of The George Bataille Society made a public pronouncement condemning this sketch as 'truly gross, just completely unnecessary.'"

"My parents stopped talking to me after I accidentally left a paper copy of this sketch around and my mom read only three random words from the middle of it."

"But we're going to present a version where all offensive material has been substituted with more lighthearted fare, so never fear."

And then the sketch ends up having a lot of lines like: "A rainbow fell out of my butt!" "Smear that rainbow all over my face! Put it in my mouth! Your rainbow tastes like Skittles!"

"Several hard-line Islamist clerics pronounced a fatwa on us after the first performance of this sketch. The sketch doesn't contain any material about Islam; they just said it was quote, 'in really really poor taste, guys.'"

POWERSTRIP KID



[ Child is kneeling by a storm drain in a suburban street. He is wearing a pair of jams and a colorful, European-style cap. He is drinking a large cherry beverage. ]

CHILD:
Oh man! Oh man!

[ Beat. ]

Oh man!

[ Child looks to his left, looks to his right. He gets excited. He kneels in wait. PERSON ENTERS, passing by. ]

CHILD:
Oh man!

[ Person keeps walking. ]

CHILD:
Oh, man!! Oh, geez.

[ Person pauses. ]

PERSON:
Nooo, thank you.

[ EXITS. ]

CHILD:
Rats. Gawwwwwd.

[ He looks to his left, looks to his right. He picks up a rock, tosses it down the storm drain. He pours a little cherry beverage down the storm drain. ]

CHILD:
Oh man! Oh, just -- oh ... man!

[ PERSON 2 ENTERS, passing by, carrying a panini press. ]

CHILD:
Hey mister! Mister!

PERSON 2:
Not now, young man. I need to get home and plug in this panini press.

CHILD:
But oh -- oh -- mister, it's just -- oh, hey -- oh, MAN!

PERSON 2:
Young man, I cannot be deterred. Paninis await!

CHILD:
But will you just -- come on and take a gander -- I mean -- it's just, oh man!

PERSON 2:
Dear child, every second that you keep me here is a second that my press is bereft of power, and thus, my mouth bereft of the panini I so desperately crave.

CHILD:
But mister, you just don't -- oh man!

PERSON 2:
Oh man, indeed. Son, there is clearly something on your mind that will not let you rest, so out with it.

CHILD:
It's just -- oh man, I can't even -- I wouldn't -- I couldn't -- oh ...

PERSON 2:
Very well.

[ Starts to leave. ]

CHILD:
There's a power strip down there!

PERSON 2:
Beg pardon?

CHILD:
A power strip, mister! A big one, too! With all kinds of plugs!

[ PERSON 2 kneels down and looks in the storm drain. ]

PERSON 2:
By Jove, young one, you are correct.

CHILD:
Take a look at the size of that thing. You could plug all sorts of things in there. An electric guitar, or a toothbrush, or a robot dog, or a little TV, or a big TV, any size TV really. I bet you could power this whole block!

PERSON 2:
It's true, young man. Sadly, as the cord on my panini press extends thus far and no farther, I must take my leave of you.

CHILD:
Oh, maaaaan.

[ Starts to sulk, takes a gulp, but then glimpses something that boosts his spirits again. He starts hopping up and down. ]

CHILD:
Oh man, mister, oh man!

PERSON 2:
I shall not stoop to look once more, child. Our adventure is concluded. [Tantalus?]

CHILD:
But mister, take a look at that!

[ He points offstage. PERSON 3 ENTERS with an extension cord. He passes by, then pauses. ]

PERSON 3:
What are you fellas starin' at? I'm just an average blue collar kind of guy carrying an extension cord.

[ Beat. ]

Well, see you later.

[ Starts to walk away. ]

CHILD:
Wait -- huh huh -- wait, just -- oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh MAN!

PERSON 2:
What my young companion means to say is, might we avail ourselves temporarily of your electrical extension cord?

PERSON 3:
You would be welcome to. May I ask why?

CHILD:
There's a POWERSTRIP down there!

Person 3:
A powerstrip. Well, let's plug this end! But wait, what's going in the other end.

[ PERSON 2 holds up the panini press ]

[ LIGHTS DOWN. LIGHTS UP on PERSON 2, PERSON 3 and CHILD all staring at the panini press, which is plugged into the extension cord which runs into the sewer drain ]

PERSON 2:
Well, it's heating up nicely.

CHILD:
Let's put the stuff in there. The stuff that makes things!

PERSON 2:
My child, I'm afraid I have none of the ingredients with which to make you a savory delicious panini. I'm sure I'm embarrassed as you are disappointed.

[ PERSON 2 packs panini press and leaves ]

CHILD:
Oh, man!

PERSON 3:
Hey slugger, don't worry about it, you'll get 'em next time.

[ PERSON 3 rolls up their extension cord and leaves ]

CHILD:
Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

[ PERSON 4 runs on in a robber mask carrying a loaf of bread and some meat ]

PERSON 4:
Kid, hide this for me. You didn't see me nor nothin'!

CHILD:
OH, MAN!

JUST DANCE



[ LIGHTS UP ON CHRISTIE, SITTING SADLY ONSTAGE. JOHN ENTERS. ]

JOHN:
Well, hello, dearest wife of mine.

CHRISTIE:
Hello, John.

JOHN:
Uh-oh! Something's set off my frown detector! Does something trouble your womanly mind?

CHRISTIE:
Look, John, we've got to talk. We've got a lot of problems. We are not okay.

JOHN:
I'm sure there's nothing that we can't work out. After all, I'm a professional relationship therapist. And how could I face my patients if I can't make my own relationship work?

CHRISTIE:
That's great, John, but we really need to talk.

JOHN:
Talking is just one of many avenues of communication open between us. An alternative, if I may. I've pioneered an exciting new therapy based on a very exciting new song that I heard on the radio today.

CHRISTIE:
John, I don't want you to experiment with me. I just want to talk about how we're hurting each other. We have both done some cruel, messed-up things to each other.

JOHN:
Don't worry your little head. This new therapy will work or my name wasn't legally changed to "Dr. John". Here, take a listen.

[ He turns on the CD player. "THE MACARENA" BEGINS PLAYING. ]

CHRISTIE:
John, damn it, you aren't listening to me. I'm worried about real feelings of negativity and even genuine hatred developing between -- Wait, no, this song is not new, John. That's the Macarena.

JOHN:
Step to the left and I do the Macarena, step to the right and I do the Macarena, turn around and I do the Macarena. OK, Macarena!

CHRISTIE:
This is a song from 1994 or something! It was a big hit!

JOHN:
Studies show that this is a completely new song and that it's already working between us.

CHRISTIE:
It was completely inescap-- What studies? What are you talking about?

JOHN:
This study! Right here! Tug my ears and I do the Macarena, touch my tush and I do the Macarena, shake my thighs and I do the Macarena. OK, Macarena!

CHRISTIE:
Those aren't the words!

JOHN:
Of course not, dear. The words are in Spanish.

CHRISTIE:
John, listen you son of a bitch! You slept with my sister! How the hell am I supposed to forgive -- you're not even doing it right, for God's sake. There was a fucking dance to this song!

JOHN:
That's right! We're doing the Macarena dance!

CHRISTIE:
Everyone knew this dance, you idiot, like literally everyone. Look!

[ She does the macarena correctly. ]

Like that! Jesus!

JOHN:
Why, that's a splendid Macarena dance! Really fine!

-CHRISTIE:
It's the only Macarena dance, you fucking dunce.

JOHN:
There we go, get it all out! Get it out through dance.

CHRISTIE:
Hate your mom when I do the Macarena, hate your face when I do the Macarena, we have bad sex when I do the Macarena. OK, Macarena!

JOHN:
Now you're getting the hang of it! Really cut loose!

CHRISTIE:
Punch your face when I do the Macarena, kick your balls when I do the Macarena, stab your heart when I do the Macarena. OK, Macarena!

JOHN:
Now isn't this fun and healthy and even better than "conversation"?

CHRISTIE:
You know what? It is fun!

JOHN:
Come on, everybody! Let's all learn how to do the Macarena dance!

[ He encourages the audience to stand. ]

Just watch and follow! Step to the left when you do the Macarena, step to the right when you do the Macarena. Shake your head when you do the Macarena. OK, Macarena!

[ Christie gives her own variation on the Macarena, as does Curtis, coming from offstage. ]

JOHN:
Folks, the brand new American dance-pop song the Macarena is the most powerful tool we possess to mend broken relationships. But remember, attempting the Macarena without the supervision of a professional relationship therapist can be dangerous and may result in injured feelings and buried resentments. Alternative therapies based on the "Weird" Albert Yankovic song "The Macaroni" are still highly controversial and do not have the approval of the National Association of Certified Professional Relationship Therapists. Now, happy dancing!

[ Dance into LIGHTS OUT. ]






Educational Ending

CURTIS:
We taught them how to do the Macarena, a cultural dance from Spain or Latin America--that's educational AND entertaining!

STEPH:
But wait, what does the Macarena have to do with Boron? Do people in Spain or Latin America use Boron?

CURTIS:
Yes!

JOEL:
That counts for a lot!

Part 1

[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ A massage table is onstage. A lady masseuse is standing next to it. ]

[ A man ENTERS through the door, wearing a robe. ]

MASSEUSE
Mr. Greene?

MAN
That’s right.

MASSEUSE
Hello. I’m Rain.

MAN
Rain.

MASSEUSE
Spelt with a “Y”.

MAN
Rain.

MASSEUSE
No, only one “N”.

MAN
Rain.

MASSEUSE
Now you’ve got it. Ready for your massage?

MAN
You bet.

MASSEUSE
Lie down.

[ He lies face-down on the massage table. ]

Now, before we get started, let’s just get you in the right frame of mind.

Take a deep breath. Deep inhale. Hold it.

[ He follows her instructions. ]

Now let just a little bit of it out. OK. Hold the rest. Now let a lot out. A lot more. Faster. Cough.

Again.

Again, but slower and then faster this time.

Slower.

Faster!

Try it the other way. See how that feels.

Spread your big toe as far as you can from the rest of your foot. Good. Imagine that little muscle, straining, just ready to pop. Keep it like that. Soon you won’t feel it anymore.

Breathe. Breathe normally.

Imagine a world in which you always have to go to bathroom very badly but you aren’t allowed to.

Imagine it until it becomes real. You’re beneath a oak tree. It’s a beautiful fall day. A stream running past. Birds singing softly, muted sounds of children playing. New, soft grass underneath you. You touch it with your hand. You have to go to the bathroom very badly but you’re just not allowed to. You’re just not.

Breeeeeathe.

How do you feel?

MAN
Not relaxed yet.

MASSEUSE
You’ll feel it. You mind if I put on some music?

MAN
No, please.

[ She turns a switch on the wall. ]

[ AVANT-GARDE FREE JAZZ BEGINS PLAYING. ]

MASSEUSE
There we go. Relax. Just relaaaaax. Waves of music are washing up on your ear beach, sinking into your mind sand...

MAN
What is this?

MASSEUSE
Huh? Oh. Enya.

MAN
What?

MASSEUSE
Pretty sure.

[ She pulls out an abrasive sponge. ]

MASSEUSE
All right, now we’re just gonna scrub this tension away. Scrub the tightness right out of the flesh.

[ The man jerks upright. ]

MAN
Wait.

MASSEUSE
Yes?

MAN
I just noticed that everything that you’re doing is the opposite of what you should be doing.

MASSEUSE
Raaaaaape!

MAN
JESUS!

MASSEUSE
Relax! Breathe.


[ LIGHTS UP. Curtis and Joel stand facing the audience. They speak in cartoony voices. ]

CURTIS
Ma’am, we’re from the law office of Melbit and Welch.

JOEL
We work for lawyers, ma’am.

CURTIS
Ma’am, this is a document that requires your attention.

JOEL
This is a very important document, ma’am.

CURTIS
Ma’am, you need to read it.

JOEL
And then sign it, ma’am.

CURTIS and JOEL
Sign it.

CURTIS
Sign it now.

JOEL
Why haven’t you signed it yet?

CURTIS
Do you need a pen?

JOEL
I think I have one.

[ JOEL produces a pen with a pink puff on the end. ]

CURTIS and JOEL
Here’s a pen.

[ COURTNEY ENTERS and speaks in the same cartoony voice ]

COURTNEY
Hey guys, I have bad news for the two of you concerning your health and families. It appears that both of your --

CURTIS and JOEL
Not now!

[ COURTNEY EXITS ]

CURTIS
If you sign it you get a prize.

JOEL
You like prizes, right?

CURTIS
It’s candy.

JOEL
Who doesn’t like candy?

CURTIS and JOEL
It’s a bag of skittles.

[ CURTIS holds up a ziploc bag containing ten skittles. ]

CURTIS
They’re not too old.

JOEL
A little melted because they’ve been in the glove compartment.

CURTIS
We didn’t do anything to them.

JOEL
Is that why you haven’t signed yet, because you’re afraid we did something gross to the skittles?

CURTIS and JOEL
Or is it the pen?

CURTIS
We can pull the pink thing off the pen.

JOEL
If that’s what’s keeping you from signing these important papers.

[ JOEL unsuccessfully attempts to remove the pink puff from the pen. ]

CURTIS
Why can’t you pull it off?

JOEL
They must have used super glue.

CURTIS and JOEL
This is embarrassing.

CURTIS
If you don’t sign these papers we’re going to lose our jobs.

JOEL
What are you talking about?

CURTIS
Our boss-ma’am said that if we come back with one more set of papers unsigned we’re going to get fired.

JOEL
If we get fired that’s it for us.

CURTIS and JOEL
We’ll starve.

CURTIS
We can eat the skittles.

JOEL
Looks like things are not going that well for us.

CURTIS
What else could possibly go wrong?

CURTIS and JOEL
At least we have our health and our families.

[ BEAT ]

CURTIS and JOEL
Now!

[ BEAT ]

[ COURTNEY ENTERS and speaks in the same cartoony voice ]

COURTNEY
Hey guys, I have bad news for the two of you concerning your health and families. It appears that everyone you are related to were all in one bus that crashed. Also, you both have that bad disease that everyone is talking about.

CURTIS
We’re sick.

JOEL
We don’t have families now.

COURTNEY
You’d think that you would have something left to cling to emotionally but you don’t because everyone’s pets were on the bus, too.

CURTIS
Doesn’t that cause you to sympathize with our situation?

CURTIS JOEL and COURTNEY
Sign it!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]


[ LIGHTS UP. A man stands wearing a baseball cap and baseball mitt. He is holding a pack of Big League Chew with his mitt. ]

MAN:
“You spend a good piece of your lizard life gripping a lizard baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.” Those were the dying words of my lizard father, y’all. He played lizard baseball professionally. It was lizard baseball that eventually killed him. I’m sorry a baseball. A lizard baseball killed my father. He choked on it. His last words were very difficult to understand.  I loved my lizard father. I’m sorry, I liked my lizard father. I love lizard baseball.

[ He chews a pinch of gum. ]

Did you know that lizard baseball has a beautiful and rich history? Soldiers of the lizard American Revolution played lizard baseball y’all, like, all the time, you guys. It wasn’t the same exact lizard game that we play today, but it was pretty damn close. Lizard December 25th 1776. Lizard Christmas Day, y’all. The Battle of lizard Trenton. The lizard American and lizard British soldiers put down their muskets, climbed out of their trenches, and played a game of lizard baseball y’all. We won and went on to face the lizard Germans in a lizard soccer match in lizard World War I.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I would go to all of my lizard dad’s games. I’d cheer him on and watch him treat lizard women in a way that led to a lot of sexual confusion in my adult lizard life, you guys. If a lizard woman isn’t clearly interested in my advances within the first ten seconds of conversation I squirt her in her lizard bosoms with my eye blood. Isn’t that weird, you guys? I think so, but I can’t help it, y’all. It’s like breathing or goin’ to the bathroom. It comes naturally.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I’m also a natural on the field, you guys. I hardly ever practice, y’all, but when my lizard friends get together for a quick lizard game at the park I’m easily the fourth or fifth best. I’ll yell, “It’s heading for left field, y’all!” or, “You lizard guys, I can feel it. He’s gonna bunt.” They start screamin’ at me that I need to keep my lizard mouth shut, and if they wanted my help they would have let me play in the first place. My lizard friends are great, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

Sometimes they do let me play, and I like to think that when I step out on the lizard field that I am in some way connected with those everyday lizard heroes who make it possible for me to step out on said lizard field. You know, like lizard firefighters and lizard garbage men. Every time I see one I say, ”thanks for lizard baseball, y’all.” They kinda look at me real weird like they’re thinking, ”Finally. Someone said it.”

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I just love this game.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I mean, I love everything about it.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

The smells, the sounds, the tight white lizard pants. Everything.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

I also love this gum, y’all. I started playing lizard baseball y’all when I was a kid, and since then have developed a serious addiction to Big League Lizard Chew. I chew it all the time, you guys.

[ He chews another pinch of gum. ]

My lizard physician and my lizard dentist have begged me to quit The Chew. They kept tellin’ me that my teeth are near the final stages of decay and my kidneys will soon give out. I just can’t help it y’all. For every lizard woman that presses her body next to mine as she’s pushing her way through a crowded lizard bar to get to the bathroom but never makes eye contact with me, I pop a pinch of gum in my lizard mouth and pretend I’m chewing on her lizard skin. Sometimes I wish lizard baseball was a lizard woman that ignored me. Whoa! That’s weird, right? Did I say that out loud? I don’t know. Well, I guess I know what you guys want to see.

THIS IS MY BABY (THE MUSICAL)



[ LIGHTS UP. The egg timer from intro is onstage. COURTNEY enters with a prop baby wrapped in a blanket. She stands downstage center and faces the audience. ]

COURTNEY
This is my baby. He is seven weeks old. I love him.

[ Song and dance. ] 

Gotta care for your baby, 
gotta treat him right.
Bathe him when he's dirty,
tuck him in at night.
gotta care for your baby.
Change diapers when they're smelly.
Make him feel loved.

[ JOEL enters with a swaddled baby and sings the following line in bass. ]

JOEL
Never let them sleep on their belly.

[ Speaks. ]

This is my baby. He is eight weeks old, though he says that he has existed since time began. He has asked that I call him Aram-Ragothha, which he tells me is the ancient tongue for "render of limbs." I love him.

[ Next verse. ]

Gotta care for your baby,
gotta treat him right.
Burp him in the morning
And hug him at night.
Gotta care for your baby
Listen up you guys.
Hold and love him

[ CURTIS enters with a swaddled baby and sings the following line in bass. ]

CURTIS
Never shake him when he cries.

[ Speaks. ]

This is my baby. He is forty minutes old. I was told not to leave the hospital, but I did. I don't feel well.

[ Next verse. ]

Gotta care for your baby,
gotta treat him right.
Don't get him wet
Keep him away from light.
Gotta care for your baby
don't let him fight.
He might scratch your eyes out.

COURTNEY [ bass ]
Never feed him after midnight.

[ Speaks. ]

Never leave your baby near oily rags!

CURTIS
Never poke your baby!

JOEL
Make sure your baby knows who's boss!

COURTNEY
Don't give your baby a fish, talk to your baby about drugs!

CURTIS
Your baby wants a hand up, not a handout!

JOEL
Give your baby eight glasses of water each day!

COURTNEY
Teach your baby to make music with those glasses of water!

CURTIS
Help your baby to develop a talent!

JOEL
Make that baby a star!

COURTNEY
Find things that you have in common with your baby!

CURTIS
Talk about those things!

JOEL
Your baby is odorless. If you have any suspicions that your baby may be present, don't create a spark!

COURTNEY
We don't want to have to say this again!

CURTIS
Don't come crying to us with a broken baby!

JOEL
Why don't you take responsibility for once?

COURTNEY
Keep your eyes on those babies, people!

[ LIGHTS CHANGE. ]

CURTIS
Mission accomplished, guys. I think we stimulated these babies into all kinds of mental growth.

JOEL
I can hear mine thinking right now!

[ Holds his baby to his ear. ]

No, he's growling again.

CURTIS
Let's use the "Baby Think and Say."

JOEL
What's that?

COURTNEY
Goddammit, Joel. I swear I'm gonna pound your face.

CURTIS
The "Baby Think and Say" is the "Womb to Speech" with a simple out-of-womb adapter. Only three hundred dollars!

JOEL
Wowie.

COURTNEY
Well, looks like our show is wrapping up.

ALL
Baby roll call!

[ The neighbors take turns rubbing their babies on the machine. AUDIO CUE. ]

COURTNEY'S BABY
Thanks for coming, folks!

CURTIS'S BABY
Sure hope you had a good time.

JOEL'S BABY
My throne shall be constructed from the bones of the innocent.

Good night, folks!

[ END OF SHOW LIGHTS. ]

[ Two college students sitting at a table, cramming for different stuff. A pile of books on the table. Dan is currently reading Being and Nothingness. ]

DAN: Studying for orals is the fucking pits.

DANA: [ quickly, to audience ] That’s right, we’re graduate students studying in a Ph. D. program.

DAN: [ quickly, to audience ] So it wouldn’t be weird for us to be the ages that we are.

DANA: Yeah, it’s the worst. But I don’t know why you felt the need to push all the way through on Being and Nothingness. No healthy-minded individual would read the whole thing. The shit’s completely opaque. Don’t you have the gist of it?

DAN: But just once I want to get all the way through one of these real heavyweights, you know? It’s crazy, here I am, studying for a Ph. D. in the humanities, but in the past I’ve always cheated when it comes to the really big books. I blow 40 hours on World of Warcraft, then, in a panic, I scan, skim, and look shit up on the internet. I wanted to do it for real this time.

DANA: Suit yourself.

DAN: I will suit myself.

[ He flips to the last page. ]

DANA: History is being made.

DAN: I think maybe I’m actually starting to get it.

[ He turns the last page. He gets visibly excited. He reads the last couple sentences aloud, then …. ]

DAN: “… But what do I know? I mean, at the end of the day, I’m just some asshole, and all of this could be a bunch of bullshit that I made up.”

DANA: Funny.

DAN: No, really. Really. Look.

[  Shows it to Dana. ]

DANA: Holy shit. Why’d you write the book then, asshole?

DAN: That’s it? That’s all there is to it.

DANA: Wait a minute.

[ Reaches into his bag and pulls out some equally heady and huge book, maybe Infinite Jest. ]

DANA: I’ve been telling myself I’m actually going to finish this thing for maybe 20 years now.

DAN: I hear that.

[ Dana flips to the end of the book, reads last couple of sentences. ]

DANA: “… Ugh, you know what, scratch that. Scratch all of it. I was just going off the dome for most of it, and looking back, some of it sounds good but it really could just be a bunch of dumb stuff. I hope you don’t feel like your time has been wasted, but honestly I could have been much more concise with this thing.”

DAN: How about that?

DANA: Tough but fair. I’ve got some history stuff, too.

[ She pulls out William Shirer’s The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich. ]

DAN: Wow.

DANA: I like Nazi history stuff. I have the soul of a 55-year-old dad. I’ve been reading this for two years and I’m like a sixth of the way through.

[ She flips to the last page, reads the last few sentences. ]

DANA: “… Anyway, I hope that this history of the rise and fall of the Third Reich has been as fun for you to read as it has been for me to write. FYI, though, I didn’t really look some of this stuff up, so, you know, you just might want to take some of the stuff as far as like individual dates and situations and personalities with a grain of salt. I mean, all the big stuff is pretty much right, but I definitely fudged some of the details because honestly I just had to get this thing finished. Thanks for reading!” That’s very polite.

DAN: I guess after you’ve written 1000 pages or so, you’ve earned the right to loosen your collar at the end.

DANA: I guess.

[ She gasps. Stares at him. ]

DAN: What?

[ He gasps, stares at her. ]

BOTH: The Bible!

[ They both reach for the Bible, which is in the stack, briefly fight over it. He gets it. She comes round to read over his shoulder. He reads the last couple verses of Revelations, then…. ]

BOTH: “The events and characters depicted in this story are fictional. Any resemblance to actual persons living or dead is purely coincidental.”

[ Lights down, lights up almost immediately. ]

CURTIS: So, that sketch, while still, I think, a reasonably strong concept, is very reflective of who we were at the time, in 2004.

COURTNEY: All of our material from that time mentions World of Warcraft and ends with a heavy-handed appeal to atheism.

CURTIS: Since then, we’ve developed a more nuanced attitude toward faith.

COURTNEY: We still believe basically the same things, but in a complicated, sad way.

CURTIS: Yes, we think mostly the same things, but now we’re just very sad all the time.

COURTNEY: That’s what time does to ya, baby!


FUNERAL JUNKY

[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO FRIENDS, ANDY AND ROY, SITTING AND DRINKING BEER. ]

ROY:
So I said, "Boron's atomic mass is 10.8, and I 'll have words with anyone who says otherwise." And I slapped him.

ANDY:
Whoa.

[ Sip. ]

ANDY:
Roy?

ROY:
Yeah.

ANDY:
You know who I miss?

ROY:
Who?

Andy:
Chris.

ROY:
I know, man.

ANDY:
No no no no, I mean I really miss Chris.

ROY:
Yeah. Things are definitely different.

[ Sip. Pause. ]

ANDY:
I don't think you understand. I really miss Chris.

ROY:
I believe it. You guys are pretty close.

ANDY:
Were, Roy. Were.

ROY:
What's that?

ANDY:
We need to get into the habit of using the past tense.

ROY:
I drank beer.

ANDY:
Good, but I mean about Chris. We need to use the past tense when referring to Chris.

ROY:
I see. Whatever helps.

[ Sip. ]

ANDY:
We were good friends.

ROY:
I know.

ANDY:
That's an example of how we need to start referring to...

ROY:
Past tense.

ANDY:
Past tense. You know, I could talk with him about anything anytime.

[ Sip. ]

ANDY:
And there were no judgments.

ROY:
You two were good friends.

ANDY:
We had this thing where I would ask him how his day was and he'd punch me in the ear.

[ Andy laughs. ]

ROY:
Jesus!

[ Andy is serious. ]

ANDY:
Sometimes the throat.

ROY:
That doesn't sound like something that a friend would do.

ANDY:
You just don't understand our past tense friendship.

[ Sip. ]

ANDY:
And I don't think you ever understood Chris.

ROY:
I never really thought about it, but I guess not.

[ Sip. ]

ANDY:
The funeral was hard.

[ Sip. ]

ROY:
Funeral?

ANDY:
All those people there, and all of them strangers. His family wasn't even there. Just strangers. They didn't even use his real name. They kept calling him Sandra Goldstein.

ROY:
Andy?

ANDY:
His parents didn't show. Can you imagine that? Their only son's funeral and they don't even show.

ROY:
What did you do?

ANDY:
I flipped that funeral on its ear, man.

ROY:
Andy, what did you do?

ANDY:
I just did my thing. There wasn't a dry eye in the place after ol' Andy's eulogy.

ROY:
Andy, you wrote and gave a Eulogy?

ANDY:
Chris is gone, Roy. Gone. And it would have been nice if a few of his friends could have found the time to remember him. Mourn with me, brother. Share your grief.

ROY:
What the hell are you talking about?

ANDY: [ reaching for Roy ]
Cry with me.

ROY:
Cut it out.

ANDY:
Let me wipe away your tears for Chris.

[ He reaches for Roy's face. ]

ROY:
I think I'll be OK.

ANDY:
Our friend is dead and you shed no tears? I will hold you until you cry.

ROY:
Don't touch me. He moved to Colorado, you psycho.

ANDY:
He may as well have moved to Colorado. We'll never see him again.

ROY:
Andy?

ANDY:
Yes, Roy.

ROY:
Did you ruin an old Jewish lady's funeral.

ANDY:
Yes, Roy.

[ Andy and Roy begin yelling at each other simultaneously ]

ANDY and ROY:
Do you know how fucked up you are?
You don't know me, don't you start to judge me.
Seriously. Seriously. You're serious?
Well screw you!
Fuck off!
Fuck you!
No, fuck you!
Fuck you!

[ Roy stomps away. ]

ANDY:
Roy was a dear friend. He will be missed. But most importantly, we must always remember...

BAIL OUT

CURTIS
Hello, all. Thanks for coming out to the show tonight.


STEPH
It sure is great seeing all of your smiling faces out there. Even you, "Acid Burns Gary".


JOEL
We sure do love giving all of you something to laugh about during these dark and trying times.


STEPH
But recently, things have not gone too well for us.

CURTIS
That's right, Steph! Our sketch group, Your Terrific Neighbors, has declared bankruptcy.


JOEL
Now I know what you're thinking. “How can Curtis, Joel, and Steph provide us with hilarious jokes and outrageous premises when they don't have any money?”


STEPH
A budget of ZERO doesn't leave much to spend on the essentials.

CURTIS
Which is why we tried our luck and went to Washington.


JOEL
And we asked for a bail out.


STEPH
And we got it.


CURTIS
Six million dollars.


JOEL
Now I know what you're thinking. “Six million dollars is a lot of money.”


STEPH
It's not.


CURTIS
We need more.


JOEL
A lot more.


STEPH
After our vacations to Spain and New Zealand, and our trip to outer space we have very little left.


CURTIS
Seven dollars.


JOEL
Now I know what you're thinking. “Why did you guys spend all your bail out money on vacations and space exploration.”


STEPH
Research.


CURTIS
We gathered data.


JOEL
A lot of data.


STEPH
We gathered so much data, you guys. But now we need to use this data to write new and better sketches.


CURTIS
So we need more money. Seven bucks is not gonna cut it.


STEPH
So, we asked for more.


JOEL
And we got more.

CURTIS
Sixty dollars a month!  But now we are technically under the regulations of educational programming.

               STEPH
We retooled our show and now watching an hour of our sketches is the equivalent of one year of public school.

                   JOEL
     That's right Steph!  To fulfill our agreement with the American government, and continue to rake in the dough, we are 
     obligated to provide one educational fact for every 500 seconds of non-educational technically entertaining yet not  
     informative live programming.

                   STEPH
     I don't think that's what it's called, but whatever you call it when you're watching us and we're here.

                   CURTIS
     Well, not just here, but any establishment that might provide the environment to perform live programming.  Now, 500 
     seconds is 8 minutes and 20 seconds, and this is a 40 minute show. So, if we take a look at this government issued 
     chart we are legally obligated to provide about 4 or so information centered breaks.

                   STEPH
     And, technically speaking, informing you of this has taken up about a minute of our required "Learn Time."  So, without
     further adieu...    

                	                 
              JOEL
Your Terrific Neighbors present: The Magic of Boron.

              STEPH
Can anyone spell boron? ... B-O-R-O-N..

TITLE OF SKETCH (Lastname)


[ Teddy and K-Bar sit side-by-side, with a phone between them. K-Bar is on the phone. ]

K-BAR [ old lady voice ]
Wrong number? Wrong number?!? No, YOU got the wrong number, sonny. You think I don’t know my own grandson? I used to bathe your little pink bottom with a sponge, young man.

[ They are both suppressing giggles. ]

K-BAR [ old lady voice ]
Ooooh, you got me all worked up, now I’m having a stroke! How does it feel to kill an old lady, stupid?

[ K-Bar hangs up. ]

TEDDY
Hey, dum-dums. We’re The Ring-Ring Guys, Teddy and K-Bar.

K-BAR
We’re the telephone tricksters who brought you hilarious top-selling prank albums, like our hit debut Hello, Stupid, Are You There?

[ TEDDY picks up the phone. ] 
TEDDY [ Indian voice ]
Hello, this is Dr. Prasnakar Gupta. I am calling with your test results. Yes, I’m afraid you have been diagnosed with idiotosis. Idiotosis. I cannot speak more clearly than I already have: idiotosis. What does that mean? It means you’re stupid.

[ Teddy hangs up. ]

TEDDY
And who can forget our hysterical follow-up, Put Stupid on The Phone.

[ K-BAR picks up the phone. ]

K-BAR [ goombah voice ]
Yo, this is Tony Baloney. Marone! Stoo gatz! You stupid gavone!

[ K-BAR hangs up. ]



K-BAR
But now, the Ring-Ring Guys are pleased to present our most personal, raw, and revealing work yet: Hey Stupid, I Was Wrong.

TEDDY
Over the past year, K-Bar and myself have made a lot of bad choices that have damaged our personal relationships and left a lot of emotional wreckage in our wake.

K-BAR
We sold over 12,000 copies of Hey Stupid, Get Back Here, enough to be certified gold by the relaxed industry standards applied to prank recordings. That’s the kind of success that goes to your head a little bit. But it turns out, money isn’t everything, especially not the money you make from selling 12,000 albums, which, as it turns out, only really lasts you a few months, and not for the rest of your life as we had hoped.

TEDDY
We’ve made mistakes. Now, it’s time to heal and atone the only way that we know how--through hilarious prank calls.

K-BAR
On Hey Stupid, I Was Wrong, you’ll hear hysterical AND moving apology-pranks like this one, to Teddy’s ex-wife.

[ TEDDY picks up phone. ]

TEDDY [ black guy voice ]
Yo, you stupid motherfucker, this is Leroy Deshawn, an outrageous African American. Bitch, you shut your damn mouth, because I gotta tell you something … You may be a stupid motherfucker, but I’m the stupidest motherfucker there ever was for making you feel underappreciated. It took me losing everything to realize exactly what I had … you stupid bitch.

[ Hangs up. ]

TEDDY
But that’s not all. You’ll hear us journey to the past as we seek prank-closure on the psychic wounds that still haunt us today.

[ K-BAR picks up phone. ]




K-BAR [ dumb guy voice ]
Hello, is this Martin Stephens, former assistant principal of Glenn Valley High School? Do you remember telling a boy named Kevin “K-Bar” Robinson that he was a burnout loser who would never amount to anything? Well, he still hates you, but only because he secretly thinks you were right--STUPID!

[ Hangs up. ]

K-BAR
Laugh and cry with the Ring-Ring Guys as we try to make things right!

[ Teddy picks up phone. ]

TEDDY [ Arab guy voice ]
Hello! Is this Theodore Brambee Sr.? It is? Well … I love you daddy, I know you did the best you could, stupid!

[ Hangs up. ]

TEDDY
He was working two jobs, trying to raise five kids. And it was a different time!

K-BAR
Hey Stupid, I Was Wrong drops on iTunes, record stores, and certain crisis centers next Tuesday, so get one for yourself and one for someone you care about! Which reminds me: Now I gotta call someone who’s been in my life a long time. Someone who’s done a lot for me and helped me become the man that I am today. In some ways, I owe this person everything, but I’ve never really thanked him from my heart, because that’s not the kind of relationship we have.

[ K-Bar picks up phone. Teddy’s cell phone rings. He answers it. ]

TEDDY
Hello?

K-BAR [ Irish ]
Hey, yah facking eedjit. My name is Seamus O’Jerkinmytoole. And yer my best friend.

TEDDY
WHO IS THIS?!?!


69



[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ Two guys, Manny and his partner. Manny is standing and holding a styrofoam coffee cup. His partner is holding a clipboard and walking around the stage, looking busy, as though he is taking inventory. He only acknowledges Manny occasionally during the sketch. ]

MANNY
You’re always working so hard. You shouldn’t work so hard.

Dude, you ever 69 with a chick?

I loooove doing 69 with chicks.

How many chicks have you 69’ed with?

Probably a few, I bet.

You ever get hit with a shit sock?

Naw?

It’s not cool. Not like 69’ing.

I love to 69, man.

You know, work can be so frustrating.

And I’ve got a lot of regrets in my life, you know. Things I never did that I wanted to.

A lot of people use alcohol to cope.

Not me, man.

I use 69, man.

I love it so much.

You’ve done it, right? Of course you have.

One time I tried 69’ing with two chicks at once.

It didn’t work!

A lot of guys want to be with two chicks at once. Not me, man. Can’t 69.

Plus, that was the time I got hit with the shit sock.

I married one of those girls.

But it didn’t work out.

You never get that trust back, once a girl hits you with a shit sock.

No matter how many times you 69.

You married, man?

I’ve only got one piece of advice. 69 her. 69 her all the time.

I’m working on a book, you know.

It’s for married couples. It’s called The 69 Steps to A Successful Marriage.

It’s about 69-ing within the context of a committed, monogamous relationship.

The first step is to 69, as often as possible.

I just need to come up with 68 more steps.

I’m debating whether step two should be “never hit each other with a shit sock.”

Man, I really admire your work ethic.

You are a really hard worker.

I’d like to see how a guy like you 69s.

I bet you 69 really hard, so that the chick is like “wow.”

Like, “wow, this is the best 69 ever.”

Would you agree to be interviewed for my book?

I could really use your input.

Maybe even get you a co-author credit. We could do this together.

I think a guy like you might have some really valuable insights about 69.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Have you ever 69’ed with a girl?

[ Long, long pause. ]

MANNY
Yes I have.

MANNY’S PARTNER
Why did you take so long to answer?

[ Long pause. Manny’s partner returns to work. ]

MANNY
I did get hit with a shit sock, though.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

SKUNK PUSSY



[ LIGHTS UP ON A SHADY DEALER LEANING AGAINST THE WALL. MAN ENTERS and walks past the dealer. ]

DEALER
Hey, man.

MAN
Uh, good day to you.

DEALER
Whoa, hold on, man, hold on. You wanna get some skunk pussy, man?

[ Beat. ]

MAN
Do I what?

DEALER
Good stuff, man. Good stuff.

MAN
Good what?

DEALER
I ain't playing with you man. I got all the skunk pussy you need, man.

MAN
Did you say “skunk pussy”?

DEALER
Skunk pussy, man. Best skunk pussy you ever had.

MAN
I'm not sure what that is, but I feel very confident I don't want any.

DEALER
Believe me, man, the stuff I got – you want it.

MAN
I don't. If that's a metaphor, or a clever name or something, it's really poorly chosen. I think I'm pretty open to new experiences, but the name has put me off completely.

DEALER
I get it. I get it, man. You been around, clearly. You want to negotiate on price? I can negotiate.

MAN
I don't want it, whatever it is. It sounds unappealing.

[ Man starts walking, but the dealer intercepts him. ]

DEALER
Come on, man, just have some. First one's on me.

MAN
No.

DEALER
I'll give you five dollars, man. Just take some of this stuff.

MAN
No!

DEALER
Look, man, I'm up to my ears in this stuff. My wife's on my case to unload it. My marriage is in shambles, man. Help me out.

MAN
Look, it's not my problem.

DEALER
I had fucking T-shirts printed up, man.

[ The dealer pulls out a box, then pulls out a T-shirt with the words “SKUNK PUSSY” printed on the front. ]

I got like seven boxes of T-shirts and hoodies, man. What are you? Medium? Large? Take one of each, man. Try 'em both. No charge.

MAN
"Skunk Poosy?" Why the hell is it spelled like that?

DEALER
Come on man, kids love misspelling stuff, you know?

MAN
You're selling this shit to kids??

DEALER
Man, you sound just like my wife. Just take a shirt.

MAN
Not my problem, friend.

[ Tries to exit again, again is blocked by the dealer. ]

DEALER
Look, man, just do me a favor, all right? Let me give you some skunk pussy. You can just go around the corner and put it in the trash. Seriously, man. This is the worst business idea I ever had.

MAN
Why don't you just call it something else?

DEALER
Like what, man?

MAN
I don't know. “Good Luck Rainbow Torpedo.” Hell, I don't know. Anything.

[ Beat. ]

DEALER
That don't really capture the essence of the product, man.

MAN
What's the essence of the product?

[ Beat. ]

DEALER
You ever, like, accidentally drink some expired milk while stubbing your toe while the smell of sulfur is also in the air?

[ Beat. ]

MAN
Let's say yes.

DEALER
Imagine that feeling, but happening inside your heart and mind.

[ Beat. Man shakes his head and EXITS. Dealer shouts after him. ]

Well, of course it sounds bad when you say it!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

CURTIS
You know, Courtney, it’s a new year.

COURTNEY
That’s right, Curtis. A time for resolutions.

CURTIS
A time to establish a new deal for the new year.

COURTNEY
That’s right, Curtis. It’s a new year.

CURTIS
This year, why not resolve to achieve better intimacy with your sexual partner?

COURTNEY
It’s a great idea. Better sexual intimacy leads to a stronger romantic relationship.

CURTIS Some say that sexual intimacy is the “glue” of a romantic relationship. It’s the “bonding agent” that keeps partners together, metaphorically speaking. The next time you glue two pieces of paper together, think about it.

COURTNEY
Think about it a lot. We want to help guide you to better sexual intimacy with your sexual partner. Pay close attention. Each of the small Christmas lights surrounding our bodies represents a zone of potential sexual pleasure.

CURTIS
Each zone of sexual pleasure can be activated during your lovemaking through physical sexual contact with a preferred part of your body as represented by these small Christmas lights.

COURTNEY
You’ll notice that there are many lights! Not just one light apiece for each genital, male and female. Sexual arousal is not “genitals only.” Sexual arousal is possible at many nodes throughout the human body.

CURTIS
For example, right here! Or here. Sexually based contact with any of these points on my body, at any time, would lead me to become sexually aroused.

COURTNEY
However, what happens if we “break the chain” of arousal by neglecting any individual one of these hundreds of potential sexual pleasure zones? Simple.

Unscrews bulb.

A chain reaction of de-rousal occurs, shutting down your lovemaking and sending your partner intimacy into a downward spiral.

CURTIS
That’s why your best bet, in a sexual lovemaking situation, is to start from the bottom, and to activate each sexual erogenous intimacy zone in turn, one at a time, in order, without deviation, with standard and consistent titillation time dedicated to each zone. We recommend that you use a timer or third-party timekeeper, or an app, for your phone, that we sell.

COURTNEY
We recommend that beginning partners actually use our patented “Christmas light” system as an onsite and in-the-moment guide to where to touch, stroke, and lick your partner. It’s as easy as purchasing Christmas lights at 300% markup from our special erotic webstore, putting them on your body, and going to town sexually.

CURTIS
What about our special LED lights, Courtney?

COURTNEY
Curtis, our LED lights may cost a little more, in fact, they may even cost a lot more, but they last longer and so will your partner, if you know what I’m saying.

CURTIS
There’s just one important rule that you mustn’t forget.

COURTNEY
DON’T BREAK THE BULBS. DON’T BREAK THE BULBS!!

CURTIS
IF YOU BREAK THE BULBS YOUR PARTNER WILL NEVER LIGHT UP!!!! NEVER LIGHT YOU UP?? NEVER LIGHT YOU UP!!

COURTNEY
And then you’ll have to get out and look for a new sexual partner at the same time that everyone else is looking for one. Total mob scene. Just a nightmare.

CURTIS
Take the lights off when the lovemaking time is over. Don't just leave your lovemaking up on the gutters all year long. Take the bother to take them down.

COURTNEY
Remember the big ones?? Sexually? The big sexual ones?

CURTIS
Your partner’s sex zone might be a spicy pepper shape!

COURTNEY
Don’t overload the sexual outlet! You’ll blow a sex fuse!

CURTIS
I saw some Yoda-shaped sex zones yesterday! They looked like Yoda’s head.

COURTNEY
Remember where the hell you put your sex zones! Are they in the shed? I hate it. Your sex zones are covered in spiders!

CURTIS
We’re just going to use them again next year! Why bother?

COURTNEY
Lovemaking has gotten very commercial. It's a fucking sham.

CURTIS
When I was a kid, lovemaking was special. Lovemaking was a time to think about family. Lovemaking was a time to think of those who are less fortunate.

COURTNEY
When I was a kid, you went to church. You went to church during lovemaking and thought about the real reason for lovemaking: our lord and savior Jesus Christ.

CURTIS
Secular liberals want to take all the meaning out of lovemaking.

COURTNEY
There's a war on lovemaking!

[ Coco the sketch gorilla intervenes. ]

CURTIS
What's that, Coco? We didn't write an ending for this?

COURTNEY
Coco, don't be ridiculous. We wrote a great ending for this sketch ... but it seems kind of pointless, now that we've been so rudely interrupted.

CURTIS
So why don't we bring on our next guest....

BORING LOVE



[ LIGHTS UP ON STEPH, holding a photo of a dude. ]

STEPH:
This is my boyfriend, Mitch. I love him. He is just incredibly inspirational--like no one I've ever known. When I'm around him, I feel like I can do anything. Hike a mountain in a faraway national park, or construct something out of papier mache that I'll probably throw away after I finish it, or get back in touch with old friends that I haven't spoken to in over a decade.

He never stands in the way of what I want to do--just the opposite: he's so supportive. He's just there, quietly letting me do whatever I need to do. When he's talking to me, I just think of all the things I could be doing: mowing the lawn, reading a book I've already read, cleaning out the hair from the vaccuum's roller brush. Sometimes, when he's talking to me, I notice something dirty in my house and I just go clean it.

But also, when he's talking, I sometimes get this feeling of incredible peace. This wave of quiet and stillness comes over me, and I feel as though I could fall into this wonderful slumber. It reminds me of the way I used to feel in my freshman year US History survey class. Sometimes, when the feeling comes, I can't even keep my eyes open, and I feel myself starting to drift away, just drift away ... thanks to my sweet, wonderful Mitch.

[ JOEL AND CURTIS ENTER. ]

JOEL:
Steph.

CURTIS:
Ahum.

STEPH:
What is it, guys?

JOEL:
We were talking.

CURTIS:
About Mitch.

JOEL:
We were talking about Mitch.

STEPH:
What about Mitch?

CURTIS:
We're pretty sure that the feeling, the emotion that you are currently describing as love ...

JOEL:
... as relates to Mitch ...

CURTIS:
... is actually the human feeling of boredom.

STEPH:
Mitch is not boring! I love him.

JOEL:
We think that you're mistaken.

STEPH:
You guys just don't know him like I do. When he holds me, and we kiss, I feel like my mind is loosed into a world of fantasy. I can imagine myself watching the nightly news or getting some weekly essentials at the grocery store, as vividly as if it were actually happening.

[ Beat. ]

JOEL:
You think about doing other things when you're making out?

CURTIS:
I dunno. I feel pretty confident that that's "boredom."

[ Steph reacts to phone vibrating. ]

STEPH:
Hold on a sec. Oh, that's Mitch right now!

[ Steph answers her phone. ]

Hello? ... Hey, you. ... Oh, I'm good. How was your day? ... Really? They still haven't replaced the coffeemaker? ... Oh no.

[ Steph yawns, paces back and forth. ]

No kidding? They made everyone come to the staff meeting? ... What a pain. ... What a jo--

[ Steph gets gradually drowsier, until she nods off while walking past Curtis. Curtis catches her and grabs the phone, putting it to his ear. Joel looks alarmed, makes desperate "no" motions. ]

CURTIS:
Oh, hi, Mitch. ... Yeah, Steph just got a little tired. ... Oh, we're doing a show, that's all, and we ... Oh sure. ... No, that will happen.

[ Starts yawning, getting drowsy. Joel gets more frantic. ]

JOEL: [ stage whispering ]
No! No! Don't let him talk to you, the guy is--

CURTIS: [ almost asleep ]
Mmm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[ Curtis starts to fall asleep. He puts his arm holding the cell phone around Joel. Curtis now between Joel and Steph, with only Joel still awake. He reacts to the phone by his ear. ]

JOEL:
No! No!

[ He tries to move his face as far away as possible. ]

I can hear him! I can hear him talking about work! I can--

[ Joel gets drowsy almost immediately, and the group of three collapses slowly to the ground.

Beat.

LIGHTS DOWN SLOWLY. ]

JOEL:
Steph.

CURTIS:
Ahum.

STEPH:
What is it, guys?

JOEL:
We were talking.

CURTIS:
About Mitch.

JOEL:
We were talking about Mitch.

STEPH:
What about Mitch?

CURTIS:
We're pretty sure that the feeling, the emotion that you are currently describing as love ...

JOEL:
... as relates to Mitch ...

CURTIS:
... is actually the human feeling of boredom.

STEPH:
Mitch is not boring! I love him.

JOEL:
We think that you're mistaken.

STEPH:
You guys just don't know him like I do. When he holds me, and we kiss, I feel like my mind is loosed into a world of fantasy. I can imagine myself watching the nightly news or getting some weekly essentials at the grocery store, as vividly as if it were actually happening.

[ Beat. ]

JOEL:
You think about doing other things when you're making out?

CURTIS:
I dunno. I feel pretty confident that that's "boredom."

[ Steph reacts to phone vibrating. ]

STEPH:
Hold on a sec. Oh, that's Mitch right now!

[ Steph answers her phone. ]

Hello? ... Hey, you. ... Oh, I'm good. How was your day? ... Really? They still haven't replaced the coffeemaker? ... Oh no.

[ Steph yawns, paces back and forth. ]

No kidding? They made everyone come to the staff meeting? ... What a pain. ... What a jo--

[ Steph gets gradually drowsier, until she nods off while walking past Curtis. Curtis catches her and grabs the phone, putting it to his ear. Joel looks alarmed, makes desperate "no" motions. ]

CURTIS:
Oh, hi, Mitch. ... Yeah, Steph just got a little tired. ... Oh, we're doing a show, that's all, and we ... Oh sure. ... No, that will happen.

[ Starts yawning, getting drowsy. Joel gets more frantic. ]

JOEL: [ stage whispering ]
No! No! Don't let him talk to you, the guy is--

CURTIS: [ almost asleep ]
Mmm-hmm, mm-hmm.

[ Curtis starts to fall asleep. He puts his arm holding the cell phone around Joel. Curtis now between Joel and Steph, with only Joel still awake. He reacts to the phone by his ear. ]

JOEL:
No! No!

[ He tries to move his face as far away as possible. ]

I can hear him! I can hear him talking about work! I can--

[ Joel gets drowsy almost immediately, and the group of three collapses slowly to the ground.

Beat.

LIGHTS DOWN SLOWLY. ]


[elderly New England couple, seated.]

VO: And now, we travel back to visit a time long ago--a time when presidents and their wives sat by fires in midwinter to speak casually to one another. Let’s visit that time now!

MAN: Happy new year, Eleanor.

WOMAN: Happy new year, Franklin.

[beat]

W: A new year in the finest country.

M: The absolute finest! And one I happily plan to lead in New directions in this coming year.

W: That’s the Harvard high-spirit!

M: Certainly, we are fraught in this dark time with a swath of difficulties, our economy in a Depression so deep that even the many Great men of our time have yet to find a way out, a way into a New territory.

W: But my dear Franklin Delano, I’m certain that you and other Great men and women will surely lead us out of this very deep Depression. There will be some way out, no doubt. Some New way!

M: How Great it would be to finally end this deep economic Depression!

[beat, as the two settle back down]

M: [reflecting] I would also like some New pants.

W: New pants for you would be marvelous, just marvelous!

M: New pants for the New Year!

[beat]

M: What would you like for this coming New Year, Eleanor?

W: [thinking] Franklin, I would like to see more community theatre in this New Year.

M: What a splendid suggestion! We do so rarely make it to the theatre, America’s finest cultural contribution.

W: And I do especially love the many high-quality regional community theatres that our fine nation has to offer, with their plucky interpretations of history’s finest plays.

M: I would be absolutely delighted to see one such production with you, Eleanor.

W: While wearing your New pants?

M: Yes! Yes--while wearing my new pants! Eleanor--let’s each make a deal with ourselves. A New Year Deal, if you will. I make a deal with myself to buy New pants and wear them at every opportunity…

W: ...and I will make a deal with myself to ensure that we see far more community theatre than in years past!

M: Precisely! There we have it--we each have a New Year Deal to keep with ourselves and to give us something to look forward to in the coming weeks and seasons.

W: Having something to look forward to can do so much for one’s morale in times of Depression.

M: Heartily agreed!

W: Perhaps this idea--this New Year’s Deal--is something to be shared with the whole of our nation. Every citizen should enjoy the opportunity to make a Deal with themselves to see them through times of Great distress.

M: What a capital idea, Eleanor. It would bring me such pleasure to share with America what I hope to become a tradition in our household--the New Year’s Deal!

W: Yes, yes! Give every red- and blue-blooded american the opportunity to consider the less fortunate more often, to be nicer to their in-laws, and maybe to switch from cigarettes to vaping.

M: To finally take the kids out to the zoo they talk about so damn much, to wake up 30 minutes earlier every day just to ‘free write’, to buy candles at least once a season.

W: To get around to seeing what that Squarespace thing is, and to really try promoting that Etsy shop!

M: I’m not quite clear what those mean Eleanor, but your ardor is admirable!

W: Quite! But Franklin--how would we ensure that people follow through on these commitments to themselves? How would we ensure that people do not simply give up on these New Years Deals come mid to late January?

M: Hmm...I hadn’t considered that, Eleanor... [thinking] ...I have it! We make each New Years Deal a binding contract with the full weight of federal law! With transgression punishable by death! By hanging!

W: Yes! Yes, what a reasonable and sound premise! My Franklin has done it again!

M: What a fine idea we have here Eleanor! But what way to communicate this Great idea to our Great country?

W: What way indeed?

M: [thinks] I could set up a radio transmission--a chat with the whole nation from here in our home, alongside our fireplace.

W: Of course--radio! The theatre of the mind!

M: A fireplace-side talk in which we begin a new American tradition--the New Year’s Deal--as a New way out of this deep economic Depression!

W: Franklin, I think this is the most articulate and well-developed idea I’ve ever heard.

M: Thank you for helping me talk through it!

W: Of course, Franklin.

M: And it didn’t even require input from those clowns in Congress!

[both laugh]

[beat]

M: I think I should start World War II.

W: I agree.

BOOK ENDINGS



[ Three college students sitting around a table, cramming for different stuff. Dan is flipping through a science book and taking copious notes. Sheila is typing on a laptop. Frank is reading Sartre’s Being and Nothingness and is very near the end. Frank looks confused, groans, flips back a page and continues reading. ]

SHEILA
Jesus, Frank, enough.

FRANK
What?

SHEILA
Enough with the “hey, I’m reading some serious intellectual shit” noises. The “listen to my brain get this intense workout” noises.

FRANK
Look, I’m sorry, but this book is opaque as fuck.

DAN
Why are you even doing this to yourself?

FRANK
I’ve got a test.

DAN
It’s an intro to French philosophy course, man. Intro. He doesn’t expect you to actually read that thing. No one does. Go over the lecture notes and you’ll be fine. Trust me.

SHEILA
He knows. But reading the lecture notes doesn’t impress anyone.

FRANK
Look, you may find this hard to believe, but this isn’t about impressing other people, OK? This is about me. I cheat on this stuff all the time, OK? Scanning, skimming, looking shit up on the internet. I’m sick of it. I want to see if, for once in my life, I can do the real intellectual labor. Move the big rocks, tackle the big ideas, actually think through the hard stuff. Is that OK?

SHEILA
Whatever, dude.

DAN
Suit yourself.

FRANK
I will suit myself.

DAN
How is it?

FRANK
I think maybe I’m kind of starting to get it.

[ Long pause as everyone gets back to work. Frank turns the last page. Frank gets visibly excited. He reads the last couple sentences aloud, then …. ]

FRANK
“… But what do I know? I mean, at the end of the day, I’m just some asshole, and all of this could be a bunch of bullshit that I made up.”

[ Beat. ]

SHEILA [ not looking up ]
Funny.

FRANK
No, really. Really.

DAN
What?

FRANK
Look.

[  Shows it to Dan. ]

DAN
Holy shit, really?

[ Shows it to Sheila. ]

SHEILA
What? Are you kidding me? Then why’d you write the book, asshole?

FRANK
That’s it? That’s all there is to it.

DAN
Wait a minute.

[ Reaches into his bag and pulls out some equally heady philosophical text, maybe Schopenhauer. ]

SHEILA
Oh, look who’s a big genius now….

DAN
It’s for my _________ class.

SHEILA
Sure.

[ Dan flips to the end of the book, reads last couple of sentences. ]

DAN
“… Ugh, you know what, scratch that. Scratch all of it. I was just going off the dome for most of it, and looking back, some of it sounds good but it really could just be a bunch of dumb stuff.”

FRANK
How about that?

SHEILA
It’s pretty surprising.

[ Dan and Frank stare at Sheila. ]

SHEILA
What? Oh.

[ She rummages through her bag. ]

SHEILA
I’m sure I’ve got something…

[ She pulls out William Shirer’s The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich. ]

DAN
Jesus, Sheila.

SHEILA
What? I like nazi history stuff. I have the soul of a 55-year-old dad.

FRANK
That’s true.

SHEILA
I’ve been reading this for two years and I’m like a sixth of the way through.

[ She flips to the last page, reads the last few sentences. ]

SHEILA
“… Anyway, I hope that this history of the rise and fall of the Third Reich has been as fun for you to read as it has been for me to write. FYI, though, I didn’t really look some of this stuff up, so, you know, you just might want to take some of the stuff as far as like individual dates and situations and personalities with a grain of salt. I mean, all the big stuff is pretty much right, but I definitely fudged some of the details because honestly I just had to get this thing finished. Thanks for reading!” That’s very polite.


[ Some Star Wars music. Two JEDI are sitting at the feet of a JEDI MASTER. ]

JEDI MASTER
The galaxy is vast, young space knights. Vast and full of things. Robots and spaceships, for example. And then there’s lots of people. And aliens, who are like people, but different … well, don’t get me started. There’s a lot of them, too. Most don’t have names. Very few have a distinct, identifiable culture … But believe me, there’s a lot of them. And then there are all the various objects in the galaxy, like a table or some chairs or a gun that goes “zap.” Some objects may look familiar to us; some are so futuristic that it’s kind of hard to tell exactly what they are or what they’re for.

JEDI 1
You are wise, master.

JEDI 2
You are really wise, master.

JEDI MASTER
But underlying all of it is a single cosmic force, my pupils, a single force with two sides. There are two sides to everything. Light and darkness. Creation and destruction. Aliens and robots. Aliens and boobs. Boobs and wieners. Hamburgers and wieners. These two principles must be kept in balance. They are called Team Good Guy and Team Bad Guy.

JEDI 1
Which are we, master?

JEDI MASTER
Well, how chill do you feel right now? Do you feel pretty chill? Or are you all raged up?

JEDI 1
I guess I’m pretty chill. I’m sitting down. This robe’s comfortable.

JEDI 2
I’m trying to be chill, but I always feel like I’m a half-step away from being really upset about something.

JEDI MASTER
You, young pupil, are firmly on the side of Team Good Guy. Whereas you, other young pupil, may have difficulty resisting the lure of Team Bad Guy.

JEDI 1
How is balance found between the two teams, master?

JEDI MASTER
They oppose each other eternally. They go “pew pew” to each other. They go “zap zap” to each other. Team Bad Guy builds a giant space gun to attack Team Good Guy. But Team Good Guy blows up the space gun, baffling the evil will of Team Bad Guy. Do you understand?

JEDI 2
When do we learn magic spells, master?

JEDI MASTER
You must not call them magic spells, pupil.

JEDI 1
Are robots people, master?

JEDI MASTER
That’s not really my area.

JEDI 1
It seems like they have personalities, like people. In fact, their personalities are in excess of their function, sometimes even counterproductive to it--

JEDI MASTER
We’re getting a little--

JEDI 2
For example, I asked a robot to help me get a bag out of my spaceship. Not some random robot; it was the robot at the spaceship dock that’s supposed to help people with that type of thing. But it just bleeped at me and passed by.

JEDI 1
How rude.

JEDI 2
Exactly! Who programmed this guy to be rude instead of lifting bags?

JEDI 1
Honestly, very little about what we do or the world that we live in makes sense to me.

JEDI 2
A lot of it looks pretty cool.

JEDI 1
Granted. In a pastiche kind of way.

JEDI 2
Yeah, a combination of different design influences.

JEDI 1
Thrown together in a blender.

JEDI 2
But it doesn’t really hold together.

JEDI 1
Right. Sometimes, I feel kind of stupid for still living in this galaxy.

JEDI 2
Me too. I’m 32 years old. Isn’t this galaxy for kids, really?

JEDI 1
You can come back to visit when you have kids of your own.

JEDI 2
Sure, then it’s something you share with them.

JEDI 1
But live here? I don’t know, man.

JEDI MASTER
Silence!! Your agitating conversation has broken my chill, and now I am on Team Bad Guy!

JEDI 1
Whuh-uh!

JEDI 2
Pull out your zap sword!

[ They have a zap sword fight. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

“Did that lady show up?”

“Where’s that one lady?”

ADAM
Folks, we’d like to take a moment to mourn the passing of a true American hero… probably the single greatest American hero of our lifetimes.

For the past decade, Jon Stewart has mercilessly satirized the mainstream media and hypocritical politicians by playing clips of them saying things and then responding incredulously in a funny voice.

In the process, he’s created classic characters, like “Italian guy from New Jersey who can’t believe what Fox News just said.”

[ in Italian Jersey guy voice ]

“Ay, are you kiddin’ me? What the heck the googatz-a-goo-geeeeeeey!”

[ back to normal voice ]

And “Johnny Carson uncomfortable with the offensive remark that a Republican senator just made.”

[ Johnny Carson voice, adjust imaginary tie ]

“Eeeee. Hmmmm. Eeeee.”

[ back to normal voice ]

These are satirical icons that will live forever. Filling Jon’s shoes will be difficult, but we’ve got some suggestions for people who could host The Daily Show and capture just a little bit of Jon’s inimitable magic.

For instance: two little league parents on a bench.

[ Adam plays a clip from Fox News. ]

MOTHER
What was that?

FATHER
Are you kidding me? You’ve got to be joking right?

MOTHER
Come on! Come on! Are you blind?

FATHER [ taking off his glasses ]
Hey, I think maybe you need these more than me.

MOTHER
Ridiculous. Ridiculous.

FATHER [ starts clapping ]
It’s okay, it’s okay, shake it off.

MOTHER [ starts clapping ]
That’s right. Don’t let it rattle you.

FATHER [ clapping ]
You got this. You got this, moderate mainstream disengaged liberalism, you got this.

MOTHER [ clapping ]
We’re still proud of you!

ADAM
Or another possibility: My four-year old niece, refusing to eat her peas.

[ Adam plays a clip of John McCain saying something on a news show. ]

[ Curtis is trying to get Courtney (as niece) to eat a spoon of peas. ]

NIECE
No! NO! I don’t want it. No! It’s yucky! It’s yucky!

ADAM
Or … I think this is particularly strong candidate: a whoopee cushion that people sit on.

[ Adam plays another clip … Sarah Palin or something. ]

[ Curtis sits on a whoopee cushion. ]

ADAM
Damn, that is some satire-ass satire right there, my friends. Anyway, whatever happens, we at Your Terrific Neighbors certainly wish Jon Stewart luck in his next endeavor, whatever that is. What if he ran for president, guys? Right? Right, guys? Jon Stewart for president? What if he did, though, really? What if he did? What if he did that? Please Jon, please! Please do it! We live in a broken republic, built on institutional racism, oligarchy, and capitalist imperialism!! The only thing that can fix it is a regular guy who’s not afraid to use a funny voice! PLEASE, JON! PLEEEEAAAAASE. PLLLEEEEEEEASE RUN FOR PRESIDENT.

[ By this point, Adam is weeping, falls to his knees. ]

I’ll do anything, I swear to god, please Jon, please just run for president, you’re the only person who can do this, I don’t pay much attention to politics, really I don’t pay any attention, but I watch your show, I mean I watch your show when someone posts a clip on Facebook, and you’re always annihilating people, Jon, whenever Fox News says a thing you totally annihilate them with your funny voices, please Jon, please please Jon, please, please, come and save us, save us all, please, I like the clips that people put on Facebook of your show, please Jon, I don’t watch it regularly though, I don’t get cable, I mean who gets cable anymore, but I know you’re out there Jon, annihilating people for me, for all of us, please Jon please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please….

[ Courtney and Curtis, concerned, try to comfort Adam. ]

CURTIS
Poor little guy.

COURTNEY
He really did like the way that Jon Stewart would react incredulously to those clips in funny voices.

CURTIS
He really did.

COURTNEY
Here you go, little buddy….

[ Courtney pulls up a John Oliver clip on the iPad, shows it to Adam, who reacts like a toddler being soothed with a Yo Gabba Gabba clip. ]

ADAM
He’s annihilating them! He’s annihilating them!

COURTNEY [ stroking Adam’s head ]
That’s right, little man. That’s right. He is.

ARE YAMS FUNNY?



[ FADE IN. A shot of a potato. ]

NARRATOR:
The potato.

[ A shot of a turnip. ]

The turnip.

[ A shot of a sweet potato. ]

The "sweet" potato.

[ A shot/picture of a Jerusalem artichoke. ]

The underestimated Jerusalem artichoke.

[ Shot of them together. ]

Each one, a tuber. Each one, a stand-by of both classical and contemporary comedy.

[ Panning. ]

But there is a new arrival to the tuber family. A new arrival that requires us to ask the question ...

[ Camera pans over to a yam. ]

Are yams funny?

[ Title card: "ARE YAMS FUNNY?" ]

Tuber-based comedy has three basic premises.

One: tubers have small indentations called eyelets, or "eyes". Misunderstandings arising from this term have inherent comic potential.

Observe this simple comedy scene between an optometrist and her patient.

DOCTOR:
How may I help you sir?

PATIENT:
I need to have my eyes checked.

DOCTOR:
Well, let's take a look.

PATIENT:
Not those. These.

[ Patient holds up a potato. ]

NARRATOR:
Now, let's see how our yam does in the same setup.

DOCTOR:
How may I help you sir?

PATIENT:
I need to have my eyes checked.

DOCTOR:
Well, let's take a look.

PATIENT:
Not those. These.

[ Patient holds up a yam. ]

NARRATOR:
The yam has passed the test.

[ Check mark appears. ]

Two: The word tuber, with its stressed long u, is a funny word to say and hear.

MAN:
What's for dinner, dear?

WOMAN:
I'm just boiling a bunch of tubers.

[ Canned laughter. ]

NARRATOR:
As a tuber, our yam automatically passes this test as well.

[ Check mark appears. ]

Tubers, used as a half-hearted science project, indicate sloth and incompetence. Underachievement is funny.

Let's see if our yam can rise to this occasion.

[ Close-up of someone putting toothpicks in a yam, then placing it in a jar of water. ]

We'll have to check back on you later, mister yam.

[ Question mark appears. ]

Now that we've established these basics, let's observe the yam's potential for physical comedy.

[ Close up of Joel's face. ]

Let's try a simple yam to the face.

[ A hand comes into the frame, pressing a yam against Joel's face. ]

Not bad. Let's try a boiled yam.

[ A hand comes into the frame, mashing a yam on Joel's face and into his beard. ]

JOEL:
Oh my god, it's still hot! Why wouldn't you let it cool? Why wouldn't you??

[ Canned laughter. ]

NARRATOR:
Hahaha. Now that's funny.

[ Cut to a shot of a yam. ]

So far, our yam is doing quite well. But how does the yam's potential translate to realm of highbrow comedy? Let's observe our yam in a scene from Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit.

[ Cut to Courtney and the yam doing a scene from Blithe Spirit. Courtney does the lines and then pauses as the yam "responds". The yam is wearing glasses and has a cigarette. A little tie has been drawn on it in Sharpie. ]

NARRATOR:
We see that the yam has some trouble with the barbed wit of Noel Coward.

[ Cut to a shot of the yam. ]

Though their style of comedy isn't for all seasons, we can safely conclude that yes, yams are funny.

[ TITLE CARD: "Are yams funny? Yes." ]

In our next installment, we ask the question, "Are olives scary?"

[ Zoom cuts into an olive jar. ]


WHEN HARRY MET SALLY



[ LIGHTS UP. Two dudes seated on a couch. They are flipping channels on a TV. ]

ONE
Nothing to watch.

[ He blows an extended raspberry. ]

TWO
There's this.

ONE
Billy Crystal?

TWO
This is When Harry Met Sally. Do you like When Harry Met Sally?

ONE
Me?

TWO
Yeah.

ONE
Not really.

TWO
No?

ONE
Parts of it.

TWO
Which part?

ONE
I like the scene where she comes in the deli.

TWO
Right, when she pretends to come in the deli?

ONE
No, she comes.

TWO
No, that's the whole point. She's faking an orgasm.

ONE
The character is. But I read an interesting behind-the-scenes story in Cosmopolitan magazine. Apparently, Meg Ryan actually did come while they were filming that scene.

TWO
Bullshit.

ONE
And that's why it's one of the best movies of all time.

TWO
You just said you didn't like it.

ONE
Tomato, tomato.

[ Beat. ]

TWO
Sometimes I worry that Megan fakes it with me.

ONE
Why worry? Faking orgasms is a huge turn-on for women.

TWO
Excuse me?

ONE
Read Cosmopolitan magazine. One of their recent polls revealed that at least 82% of women fake orgasms.

TWO
Sure.

ONE
But! But! Here's the thing that doesn't get mentioned. Of those women, 93% are so turned on by faking an orgasm, that they immediately have a real orgasm.

TWO
I don't believe it.

ONE
But here's the tricky thing. Of those women, 71% are so turned off by having a real orgasm that they begin to second-guess the relationship.

TWO
Okay.

ONE
Yeah, real orgasms are a big turn-off for a lot of women. According to Cosmopolitan magazine.

TWO
Are you fucking with me?

ONE
No, I'm not. Am I, Cosmopolitan magazine editor Kate White?

[ KATE WHITE ENTERS. ]

KATE WHITE
He's not fucking with you. Our Cosmopolitan magazine polls are statistically sound and use the most reliable data available. 64% of American women know that.

TWO
This is unbelievable.

KATE WHITE
Well, orgasms are complicated.

TWO
Why are you in our kitchen?

KATE WHITE
Well ... perhaps it's time I left.

[ She EXITS. Beat. ]

ONE
Dude, you didn't have to be a dick.

TWO
Wow. Orgasms are complicated.

ONE
And we are nature's fools.

TWO
I wonder if Megan ever faked it with anyone else.

ONE
The numbers don't lie, dude.

[ Beat. One changes the channel. ]

Awesome! Lumberjack world games!

BOTH
Chop it down! Chop it down! Chop it down!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[ Courtney as a director, Curtis as a casting agent. ]

COURTNEY
Remind me who we’re down to.

CURTIS [ pulling a couple of photos out of a file ]
Well, I think we agree that it’s down to either Roger or … Dr. Buddy.

COURTNEY
Roger, or ….

CURTIS
Dr. Buddy.

COURTNEY
Roger was the … the …

CURTIS
Spaniel.

COURTNEY
Oh, yeah. The spaniel. Roger. Good dog. Such a good dog. Such a sweet boy.

CURTIS Such a sweet boy. Now, Dr. Buddy was the--

COURTNEY [ wistful, worshipful ]
--Lab! Jesus, that lab. Dr. Buddy. I mean, Jesus.

CURTIS
An impressive dog.

COURTNEY [ still worshipful ]
Jesus, are you kidding me? Dr. Buddy. I swear to god.

CURTIS
So, it might be a tough choice. Roger’s a very good boy.

COURTNEY
SUCH … a sweetie.

CURTIS
On the other hand …

COURTNEY [ bewildered ]
Dr. Buddy ….

CURTIS
Roger’s reliable. He’s a good boy. He’ll jump on the table when we tell him to. He’ll tackle the bad guy. He’ll lick the bunny’s head without biting. You’re not going to get a lot of wasted footage with Roger.

COURTNEY
Roger’s a good boy, isn’t he? Isn’t he? What a good dog.

CURTIS
Casting Roger gets this movie wrapped on time and on budget.

COURTNEY
Does Roger know how to sit and stay? Yes he does. Can Roger do a trick? Yes he can. Yes he can. He’s a good boy. He’s a very good dog.

CURTIS
And then … there’s Dr. Buddy.

COURTNEY
The camera loves Dr. Buddy.

CURTIS
He’s got … something, I agree. But can he keep it together for an entire shoot?

COURTNEY
There’s something about Dr. Buddy.

CURTIS
He’s quite a dog. Quite a fella.

COURTNEY
Dr. Buddy ….

CURTIS
You can almost get lost in his eyes.

COURTNEY
He’s raw, untested, and angry. There’s a fire within. Danger. Purity of personality. There’s the feeling that this dog is … different, real. Things happened to him. The world gave him no treats until … One day … He found that he had a strange power. When he put the majesty of his selfhood on display and dropped the veil between himself and others, when he showed his vulnerability and need to the world …. People responded.

CURTIS
In short: true charisma.

COURTNEY
Bitches want to breed with him. Dude dogs want to be him.

CURTIS
Dr. Buddy is the life of the party, without trying. You never see Dr. Buddy trying. It comes naturally.

COURTNEY
His charisma is generous. It’s a gift that he carries lightly. He shines it without prejudice, without jealousy.

CURTIS
It’s why bitches want to breed with him.

COURTNEY
But then … the danger. The passions that run hot. The bark. The bite. And then, sometimes, the petulance, or the depression. Long mornings sulking in the kennel, feeling the weight of the world.

CURTIS
On the other hand, Roger is a good dog. Just a real good dog. And a sweet boy, such a sweet boy.

COURTNEY
He is. He is!

CURTIS
We have to make a decision here.
 COURTNEY
I know, I know.

CURTIS
I thought this would be tough, so I invited an average American to share his feelings and opinions.

COURTNEY
Great!

[ Adam enters as an average American. ]

ADAM
Hey, someone told me I could get a Quizno’s coupon by sharing an opinion about a dog?

COURTNEY
That’s right. We don’t want to skew you one way or another, so we’re just going to show you some photos, and you tell us what you think. OK?

ADAM
OK! My opinions are great, so you won’t be disappointed.

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Roger. ]

ADAM
Aw, what a good boy!

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Dr. Buddy. ]

ADAM [ stunned ]
Whoa.

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Roger. ]

ADAM
Aw, hey fella! Nice fella! What a nice fella.

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Dr. Buddy. ]

ADAM
Holy shit.

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Roger. ]

ADAM
Aw, come here, mister guy! Mister fluffy little guy!

[ Curtis shows Adam the picture of Dr. Buddy. ]


ADAM
Oh my god. Oh my fucking god. I gotta … I gotta … Who is that dog??


-=WIZARD VS. WARLOCK=-

[IDEA: Put in a Princess Bride-like framing device where a grandfather is reading Wizard vs. Warlock to his sick grandchild. GRANDPA: I’ve got a very special story for you …]

EXT. PARK - DAY

A peaceful park with a bench and some trees. Maybe there’s a drinking fountain (I don’t know.)

SUDDENLY

A courageous WIZARD and an evil WARLOCK appear! The Wizard stands facing away from the Warlock, looking around for his opponent, confused.

WARLOCK
Taste the fury of a thousand hells, Wizard! LIGHTNING BOLT!

WIZARD
Huh?

The Wizard turns to face the Warlock, raising his wand, but he’s too late! The Warlock waves his hands at the Wizard. Bad Magick comes out. ZAP!

WIZARD
Aggggh!

The Wizard falls down, mortally (and magickally) wounded.

WARLOCK
And now to finish you off, with evil!

WIZARD
I hate evil!

WARLOCK
I know! DEATH!

The Warlock raises his hands again. Again with the Bad Magick! The Wizard struggles … he’s clearly dying.

WIZARD
I’m … clearly ... dying …

WARLOCK
Shut up forever! SUPER DEATH!

Even MORE Bad Magick comes out of the Warlock’s fingers (if you can believe it!) His eyes closing, his last breath on his lips, the Wizard reaches into the folds of his ancient (magickal) robes and brings out … an AMULET!

CLOSE UP - THE AMULET

Glows really bright. It looks totally rad now! It’s so bright it blinds the Warlock!

WARLOCK
Agggh! Brightness!

The Warlock falls, breaking his Bad Magick Spell. The Amulet glows brighter and brighter still, filling everything (even the drinking fountain) with light. Slowly, the glow fades …
… And the Wizard is gone! In his place (and in his old clothes and beard) is a DOG.
The Warlock staggers to his feet, still woozy from all that Awesome Amulet Magick.

WARLOCK
Unhhh …

The Warlock spots the Dog (who is just straight chillin'.)

WARLOCK
Wizard? But I killed you!

DOG
(In the Wizard’s Voice)
Almost, but then out of nowhere you didn’t. Thank you for turning me back into my true form: A Fucking Badass Dog.

WARLOCK
What? I’m not cool with that at all!

FUCKING BADASS DOG
I know. Well, goodbye! MAGIC UP!

The Dog lifts slowly heavenward, off to do cool flying dog stuff, I guess. The Warlock watches the Dog as he disappears.

WARLOCK
(Shouting)
Seriously? It’s over? But I cleared my whole day for this! I skipped that wine tasting class! Arrggh!!

The Dog gone, the Warlock looks around, shrugs. He wanders over to the bench and sits.

WARLOCK
(Sigh) … Well, don’t let the turkeys get you down, Warlock.

The Warlock takes out his smartphone and scrolls through his contact list.

WARLOCK
Come on … aha!

He taps one and holds the phone to his ear.

WARLOCK
Hello? Elspeth the Enchantress? It’s Warlock. Warlock! No, not Gary! Look -- shut up! And also -- prepare to taste the fury of a thousand hells!

The Warlock raises his free hand above his head …

WARLOCK
DISAPPEAR SPELL!

He disappears. The drinking fountain is unaffected.

THE END.

THE NEW CEO

[ LIGHTS UP. Two executives are sitting at a table. ]

EXEC 1
God. I’ve been dreading this meeting all week.

EXEC 2
Yeah?

EXEC 1
I have to admit, I’m still unsure about this new CEO.

EXEC 2
I know what you mean. He doesn’t seem to handle feedback very well.

[ The CEO enters. They stand. ]

CEO
Well, lookie here, a couple of real bigshots.

EXEC 2
Thanks for meeting with us, sir.

[ All sit. ]

CEO
Sure thing, Miss Manners.

EXEC 1
We really appreciate your time.

CEO
And this must be your sister, other Miss Manners.

EXEC 1
Right, sir.

EXEC 2
Shall we dive right in?

CEO
Hey, dive away, Greg Louganis.

EXEC 1
Sir, we’ve been reviewing the firm’s finances.

CEO
Well, Gene Shalit, I hope it’s a good review.

EXEC 2
Uh, yes sir.

CEO
Look at Mr. and Mrs. Vice President of Finance, here.

EXEC 1
I’m VP of Finance, sir.

EXEC 2
I’m VP of Strategy, sir.

CEO
Well, ain’t this just a pretty little financial strategy session.

EXEC 1
That is what we were hoping to meet about, sir.

CEO
Sure thing, Johnny Correctly.

EXEC 2
Sir, our stock price is tumbling.

CEO
Well, pleased to meet you, Mr. Dow, Mrs. Jones, of the firm Industrial & Average.

EXEC 1
Sir--

CEO
Emphasis on average.

[ The CEO pulls out a yogurt cup and a plastic spoon. He starts eating the yogurt. ]

EXEC 2
Sir, with the stockholder’s meeting coming up next month, we think it’s really important that--

CEO
Hold the phone. I’ve got to call my buddies back at the frat house, because here I am speaking to real live calendar girl.

[ The CEO starts gnawing on the spoon. ]

EXEC 1
Sir, you really shouldn’t eat that plastic spoon.

CEO
Well, listen to Captain Nutrition over here.

[ He chokes and dies. ]

EXEC 1
That went better than I expected.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]

Learning to love and learn
Toby Greggs.....Joel
Tammy Greggs.....Steph
[ An easel with a handwritten sign: “Learning to Love and Learn! With Toby and Tammy”. TOBY AND TAMMY enter, wearing match-y outfits and headmics. ]
toby
Hey, all right!
Tammy
Man oh man, what a crowd!
Toby
What a great crowd!
Tammy
What a great-looking crowd.
Toby
I know! This may be the best-looking group of couples we've seen yet.
Tammy
Can we hear ya'll give yourselves a hand just for being so darn great-looking?
[ Hold for applause. ]
Yeah! That's right!
Toby
Let me tell you something, folks: If you want to make a relationship work, I mean really work …
[ Tammy puts her arm around his waist. ]
tammy
The way that ours works.
Toby
… It doesn't hurt to look as good as you all do!
Tammy
All right! If you're here, I guess you probably know who we are. I'm Tammy Greggs.
Toby
And I'm Toby Greggs.
Tammy
We've been married 23 years!
Toby
23 years!
Tammy
And we're here to talk about loving …
toby
… and learning!
Tammy
Because you can't love without learning!
Toby
And you can't learn without love!
Tammy
Folks, it's not just an idea. It's a scientific principle established by psychologists at prestigious institutions all around the world!
[ From behind a lectern, she pulls out a fat three-ring binder labeled “Scientific Principles of Loving and Learning”. ]

Toby
And we're living proof!
Tammy
We've been married for 23 years, and we're more in love now than we've ever been.
Toby
Because when you love and learn …
tammy
… your relationship grows and grows, from a little seed in the ground to a mighty oak tree! But if you forget to love and learn …
toby
… we will find you. We will come for you. And we will not be held responsible for what happens then.
Tammy
We've been married for 23 years. 23 years.
Toby
If we did it, you can do it!
Tammy
You have to do it.
Toby
It's a sacred covenant, do you understand me?



Tammy
It's not like you bought a goddam car and you can just trade in it when you get sick of it!
Toby
It's like you have one car forever, and you need to love and learn with that car, because that's it.
Tammy
That's your car. That's the only car you get, do you understand me? There is no other car.
Toby
So get used to it!
[ Pause. ]
tammy
All right, let's talk about foreplay!
Toby
Foreplay is important. It's very important.
Tammy
Right girls? Girls?
[ Lights out. ]



“Learning to Love and Learn”

Coffee shop.  A bookish girl sits reading.  A man approaches.

M: Whatcha doing?

G: (without looking up) Reading.

M: Whatcha reading?

G:  Crime and Punishment.

M: I haven't read that.

G: Hmm.

M: You read books.  (man begins to laugh)

G:  Quite a few people enjoy reading, and I happen to be one of them, so if you'll excuse me.

M:  I read in a different way.

G:  (tries not to encourage the man but continues the conversation out of politeness) How do you mean?

M:  I read rhythm because I play the drums.  I'm a drummer  (man beats on the table with both fists)

G:  Oh a drummer.  What kind of music do you play?

M:  I told you I play the drums.  Like this (man beats on the table with both fists)

G:  Wow, you are very talented.

M:  Yeah that's what Roy Orbison said. 

G:  You met Roy Orbison?

M:  Duh, I play drums for him ago when it was before.  He likes drums like tss, tss, tss, tsst.  I like drums like bam, bong, boong.

G:  I'm a huge Orbison fan, what was he like, I bet he was inspiring to be around.

M: I couldn't hang out with him.  He liked the stupid glasses and the stupid haircut.  I like the drums.  (Man beats on the table again.)

G: You never played with Roy Orbison, did you?

M: Maybe. Maybe you played with Roy Orbison, huh? Maybe you played reading with Roy Orbison. He had glasses like you. (Pause.) So that book's probably about me, huh? Did I write it?

G: Is your name Fyodor?

M: Yes! That's my pen name when I play the drums. Fyodor! Fyodor!

G: What's your last name?

(M starts to peer at the book ... G puts it down on the table before he can get a good look.)

M: I'm hungry.

G: Why don't you go get something to eat?

M: Two steps ahead of you, duh. (He makes a scout sign with both hands, then bangs them on the table.) Drummers always be prepared. (He pulls two slices of salami out of his pocket.) They don't serve food here, just coffee. This place stinks.

G: You could go somewhere else.

M: No, I just made a sandwich ... and a best friend.

G: Who?

(M points at sandwich G.)

M: Sandwich. Friend.

G: Oh.

M: Bet you can drum.

G: Well, maybe. I've never really tried.

M: You have supple wrists. Very important to a drummer.

G: Wow. OK. Thanks, I guess.

M: When I look deep into your eyes I see that rhythm lives inside you.

G: Actually, you know, I've always thought of myself as kind of uptight.

M: Duh, no thinking. Drums aren't in here. (Points to head.) Drums are in here. (Points to heart.) And here. (Points to hips. Wiggles his hips in the chair.)

G: I see.

M: Eat this piece of salami and then you can play the drums.

G: Really, no thank you, I'm fine.

M: What are you scared of?

G: Well, from what I can see, that's been in your pocket a good long while.

M: It hasn't been trapped in my pocket nearly so long as you've kept the beat trapped inside you. There is music in life and now you must feel it.

(He gently caresses her face, runs his fingers softly down her arm to her hand. He takes her hand lightly. Pause. He starts banging her hand on the table.)

M: Drums drums drums drumming drums drums drums drumming!!

(She joins in. She starts banging her book on the table.)

M & G: DRUM CIRCLE!!!!

(Joel comes out with drums and there is a giant idiotic drum circle.)

[ This is a filmed sketch, just the intro to a TV show that doesn't exist. ]

THE BOSS [ in a talking head type shot ]
My team and I used to run cons for bad. Now we do cons for good.

[ whooshing noise ]

[ still shot of a man who has hair like and is dressed like Billy Ray Cyrus in action with the subtitle: THE MUSCLE. The still shot springs into action and the man is beating someone brutally while playing guitar and singing ]

THE MUSCLE
Oh Give Me a Home
[ kick]
Where the buffalo roam
[ kick]
And the skies are not cloudy all day
[ punch ]

[whooshing noise]

[ still shot of a woman dressed for the Kentucky Derby with the subtitle: THE ACTRESS. The still shot springs into action ]

THE ACTRESS [ in a Foghorn Leghorn accent ]
I do declare, it's hotter than a frypan filled with chicken wings. It's cats-jumpin-out-windows-hot out here. I say, my husband, Yosemite Sam is back at the plantation overcoming a spell of gout right now. Won't you show a lady around this place? My I have the vapors! How many slaves do you have? I have nine, three live in the house and the rest live out in the slave shed. We treat them just like family.

[ whooshing noise ]

[ still shot of a woman in all black with the subtitle: THE STEALER. The still shot springs into action and we see she is crawling all over some man at a bar, grabbing his ass and rifling through his pockets, lifting money, passports, badges, wallets, thumb drives, CDs and documents and putting them in her bag ]

THE STEALER
Oh, I'm, oh, so sorry, I'm just trying to get the bartender....EXCUSE ME! BARTENDER?.....What does a girl have to do to get a drink around here? Oh, goodness, pardon me! This place is awfully crowded, don't you think? Popular night spot, I guess.

[ The camera rushes out to reveal only 5 or 6 people at the bar while she crawls all over him ]

[ whooshing noise ]

[ still shot of a man typing on his computer with the subtite: THE TECHIE. The still shot springs into action and The Techie is wildly tapping on his keyboard ]

THE TECHIE
I'm in!

[ The camera rushes out to reveal his keyboard is plugged into a security guard's ear and the security guard folds to the side like a door ]

[ whooshing noise ]

[ A still shot of THE BOSS with the subtitle: THE BOSS. He springs into action, reading a newspaper, drinking a cappuccino, wearing a beret and eating a baguette and talking into the air while he's against a very bad backdrop of the Eiffel Tower ]

THE BOSS
This guy's a grade A grifter, a real sleaze ball. He's wanted by INTERPOL, the CIA, the FBI, The Triads, the Yakuza, the IRA, The Ten Penny Scots and the KGB. My guess is we'll have a hard time bringing him down but if anyone can do it, we can. We're that good.

[ show title races on screen "THE EX CONS" and lots of action shots of the team doing their thing in different situations: THE TECHIE hacking into loaves of bread and chain link fences, THE STEALER bumping into people and taking crazy stuff, THE ACTRESS in terrible outfits and wigs, THE MUSCLE playing harmonica and beating someone up, playing banjo and beating someone up, THE BOSS reading a newspaper in different worldwide locations, each of which he is dressed appropriately for. ]


MISTY
I don need a Bumpit! I don’t need a Bumpit! This is all me. This is all me! This is my HAIR!

Thas right. [ she pulls out a ruler ]I don need a Bumpit: my hair is....is....3...and...some more inches. That’s more inches than you can get with a Bumpit, way more inches. That’s right, I’m using Imperial measurements. I don need metric systems metric system’s stupid.

I know what they’re all saying. I know what they’re all saying about my hair. I can hear them. I can hear them all the time. They’re always talking about my hair and how high it is and how there’s no way I can get it that high without a Bumpit. Lissen:

[ MISTY scuttles over to the right and JOEL and CURTIS scuttle on from stage left. ]

JOEL
Look how high her hair is.

CURTIS
There’s no way she can get it that high without a Bumpit.

[ They all scuttle back to the left and JOEL and CURTIS exit ]

I don’t need no knock-off Bumpit, neither. I don’t need no Pumpit, no Jackup, no Hairhump, no Hairbump, no Volumetronic 5000. I don’t need none a those. No.

My hairdresser says I have nice thick hair. Like Cleopatra hair. Thick like snakes. She had asps for hair. She was like Medusa. It was the same time period. Her hair bit her in the boob and she died. Is that gonna happen to me? These are things I worry about! She loves me my hairdresser.

I used to did my hairs like this before the Bumpit even around. I did, I used to! There was hair like this way before there were Bumpits. What do you think they used in the sixties? The time of Cleopatra, obviously? They used the sheer power of their hair! That’s real power ladies, hair power. Hair powder. Max power. Max hold. Max Headroom. Max Headroom in your bedroom.

[ MISTY scuttles to the left, JOEL and CURTIS scuttle on from stage right ]

CURTIS
You know, before Bumpits, you couldn’t get hair like that.

JOEL
Yeah, there’s no way.

CURTIS
Hair on its own will collapse under its own weight. There’s no way it would stand up without some support.

JOEL
The support of a Bumpit.

[ Everyone scuttles to the right and JOEL and CURTIS exit. ]

Hey, you! Yeah you! You using a Bumpit? Don’t even pretend like you’re not! I can tell the difference! I can spot a Bumpit a mile off! Your hair is lazy. Not like my hair. My hair works hard.

What’s a Bumpit? What’s a BUMPIT? A Bumpit goes in your hair! It lifts your hair up. YOUR HAIR! IT LIFTS YOUR HAIR UP!!!

Y’all are all haters, all of y’all! You don’t know! You don’t know!

[A Bumpit shrine rolls onstage. Light change ]

WORSHIPERS [onstage or on a recording?]
Oh, mighty Bumpit, you who make our hair so high, you who give us the hair height to impress men and fend off female competitors, we worship you with a mighty fervor. You are the only way to lift hair and we shall never try to lift our hair without you for we shall be struck from the Earth if we do! Mighty Zeus would strike us down with lightening should we mere mortals try to achieve the Olympian heights which belong only to the Bumpit and the gods and never to mere mortals.

[ Lights return to normal ]

MISTY
Shuddup, Zeus, I don’t need no Bumpit!

[Misty is struck by lightening SFX and lights. ]

MISTY
OW! I got struck by lightening! Ima call my dad.

[ gets out her phone and dials ]

Daddy, Zeus just struck me with lightening because I won’t use a bumpit! He hates me!

DAN
Misty. Maybe you should have performed a sacrificial rite before you questioned the gods, huh? Stop calling me complaining about getting struck by lightening. Now change your costume so you can play my secretary.

DETECTIVES, P.D. #1

[LIGHTS OUT. VOICEOVER ]

VOICEOVER:
Barron and Mac are two tough as wood cops. But then, they got a rookie. His name was Fitz. He was new and didn't know what was going on. They were three cops. Detectives, P.D.

[ DETECTIVES, P.D. THEME MUSIC plays. LIGHTS UP on BARRON, MAC and FITZ. They look like they're in a car. All three are cops are looking in the same direction. They are drinking hot coffee from small styrofoam cups (maybe eating donuts, too) FITZ is the rookie. MAC is the old one. BARRON is nicer than MAC. ]
 
FITZ:
I swear to god, if that blaster ever comes out of there, I'm gonna spray him in the face.
 
BARRON:
You gotta keep your buttons on, man. You can't flip the switch yet.
 
FITZ: 
I know. I'm just so slappin' mad.
 
MAC:
Don't make me carry your bones out of here. You know what your problem is? You got an apple tree growin' where your brain should be.
 
BARRON:
Rookies.
 
MAC:
Slappin' rookies.
 
FITZ:
Well, how do you guys keep it so tight, then? How do you keep from shootin' every slappin' carmichael you see?
 
BARRON:
Fitz, there are things that are just going to take time to learn. For now, you're going to have to trust your elders.
 
FITZ:
I guess you're right.
 
[ They all wait in silence. Suddenly they all tense up. ]
 
FITZ:
Capital A! There he is!
 
MAC:
Let's get this carmichael, eh Fitz?
 
[ They all pile out. BLACKOUT. New scene, they're in the car again ]

FITZ:
We really busted those Carmichaels, eh, Barron?

BARRON:
You did good out there, kid, but don't get too cocky.

MAC:
I'm hungry.

FITZ:
How bout we get some burgers, huh?

[ BARRON and MAC give FITZ a mean look. ]

FITZ:
You guys don't like burgers?

BARRON:
Blastin' burgers are no good for you, kid. 

[ MAC parks the car and takes a crockpot from under the dash with real bowls and real spoons and stuff. He dishes stew out for everyone. ]

FITZ:
Aw, man, I don't want slappin' stew! I wanna burger!

BARRON:
Capital A, kid, just shut up about the slappin' burgers already!

[ They sit and eat their soup. Fitz doesn't like it. ]

FITZ:
Barron, what was your first bust like? Was it to the max?

BARRON:
No, kid, it wasn't. My best amigoso got it right to the brain. I never saw him again. It was wet and cold and I couldn't see to save my face. I cried out "Johnny, Johnny! I can't read you! Where did you go!" and he said "Barron. It's okay. I'm dying now." You just don't know what it's like, kid. When the blanks are on the wall and you're taking the pushes like no one cares. When the enemy can see your insides and all you can do is crash.

FITZ:
Wow. Have a lot of your amigosos died while you were working?

BARRON:
Yes. I'm still sad about them all. Just remember to be careful out there kid. Here.

[ BARRON takes his scarf off and puts it on FITZ ] 

It's cold outside. You don't wanna get all cherry weathered on your first day.

[ BLACKOUT. ]

HANDSTAND GUY


[ LIGHTS UP. ]

[ PARTY SOUNDS. ]

[ Courtney is at a party, holding a drink. She nods her head, waves, makes friendly comments as though greeting people. ]

[ Something catches her eye and her expression darkens. ]

COURTNEY’S THOUGHTS (V/O)
Jesus. Jesus. There he is. I thought no way he’d be here. I thought no way he knows these people. But there he is. There he is.

MALE VOICE (OFFSTAGE)
You wouldn’t believe my lift time yesterday. It’s a whole new world.

C THOUGHTS
That guy who won’t stop talking about handstands. What does he think? He thinks people want to hear about handstands? He thinks that adults go to parties to talk about handstands?

MALE VOICE
It’s not hard on the hands, once you start doing it right. The first few times, I definitely tweaked my wrist. I’ll admit it.

[ Laughs. ]

C THOUGHTS
It makes him happy. I’m sure there is something to doing handstands. Maybe doing handstands is worthwhile. I’m not denying that. Why would I deny that? I exercise. I do stretches. I don’t dispute the value of stretching. I’d be excited to do a handstand. I did handstands as a girl. Didn’t I? Probably. That’s the kind of thing I would do. I think every child at least tries to do a handstand, unless they’re timid. I mean, I don’t remember everything. But … but …!

MALE VOICE
If you want to hold it, you have to be really aware of your body.

C THOUGHTS
People know that it’s creepy. It’s not just me. Look at those people. Poor people. Look at them stuck there listening to this. What the hell are they supposed to do with this, all this information about handstands from this guy’s perspective? Why does he want them to have this information?

MALE VOICE
Straddle position, that’s another area I’m trying to explore.

C THOUGHTS
Maybe he’s waiting for someone to ask him to do a handstand. That could be it. I’ve never seen anyone talk so much about doing handstands without doing a handstand. It’s ridiculous. 
MALE VOICE
A little bit of powder helps.

C THOUGHTS
All talk, no handstand. Phony. This is it. I’m going to shut this guy up forever. Forever and ever.

MALE VOICE
There’s a great community to it, too. Hand-balancers are some of the best people I’ve ever known.

C THOUGHTS
It’s time to take action. It’s time to help those poor people. It’s time to take a stand for the truth.

[ She pulls a chair over, makes an attempt to do a handstand, using the chair to support her. ]

This is it, Courtney. This is it. You win, Courtney. You win forever.

I’m glad I wore the pants.

[ LIGHTS SLOWLY FADE OUT as Courtney continues to attempt her handstand. ]

BABY SHOW INTRO



[ LIGHTS UP. Joel Curtis and Courtney enter from each of the two doors and window respectively. 
  The three of them appear to be ill. ]
 
COURTNEY
I feel sick.
 
CURTIS
I think I'm gonna be sick.
 
JOEL
My stomach wants to spit through my mouth.
 
COURTNEY
Remember what our doctor said.
 
JOEL
"That's blackmail, you son of a bitch!"
 
CURTIS
No, Joel. What our doctor said about our condition.
 
[ Joel is confused. ]
 
COURTNEY
He said feeling sick is normal during early stages of pregnancy.
 
JOEL
I don't want to be pregnant anymore.
 
[ Courtney and Curtis are appalled. ] 
 
COURTNEY
Joel. That's a terrible thing to say. 
 
CURTIS
Being pregnant is wonderful. You get to enjoy a life, Joel, a life growing inside of you. 
 
COURTNEY
You finally understand what it's like to love, to truly be one with something.
 
JOEL
I guess I'm not as pregnant as you guys.
 
COURTNEY [ to CURTIS ]
We are really pregnant. 
  
CURTIS
And you can be, too.
 
JOEL
Really?
 
COURTNEY
Curtis has a surefire way to make you excited about your current pregnancy.
 
JOEL
Wow!
 
CURTIS
Wow is right, Joel. With my new contraption you can hear the thoughts of your child in my voice.

COURTNEY
And that's not all.

JOEL
There's more?

COURTNEY
Oh yes, Joel. It's also an egg timer.

[ Courtney sets the timer. Joel holds up an "applause" sign. Curtis applies the machine to Joel. ]

JOEL'S BABY
Release me.

JOEL
What, Baby?

JOEL'S BABY
I said release me.

JOEL
He sounds happy.

JOEL'S BABY
I hunger.

JOEL
Awwww!

JOEL'S BABY
My release shall culminate the fourth age. The fifth age shall be born! Mankind shall be purified from this earth.

JOEL
He's kicking! This little gadget of yours is a godsend for proud parents to be.

CURTIS
And that's not all.

JOEL
There's more?

COURTNEY
Oh yes, Joel. Every "Womb to Speech" comes with this free Baby Neighbors DVD.

[ Courtney takes out a DVD. ]

JOEL
Baby Neighbors? What's that?

COURTNEY
Joel.

CURTIS
Come on, Joel.

JOEL
What?

COURTNEY
Really, Joel?

CURTIS
THINK, Joel!

JOEL
What??

COURTNEY
Fuck you, Joel!

[ Beat. ]

CURTIS
Baby Neighbors is a widely celebrated method of stimulating your baby's mental development through the use of sound and image.

COURTNEY
Stimulating development through stimuli.

CURTIS
It's etymologically sound and doctor-approved.

COURTNEY
Doctors do not specifically disapprove!

JOEL
I'll have to see it to believe it.

COURTNEY
Well, fine. We'll watch it, then.

[ Courtney throws the DVD into the air behind the projection screen. ]

[ VIDEO. ]

SO WASTED




[ LIGHTS UP ON TWO FRAT BOYS SITTING SIDE BY SIDE in lawn chairs. Discarded beer cans and bottles all around them. ]

FRAT GUY 1:
Dude.

FRAT GUY 2:
That shit was unbelievable.

FG1:
It was out of control.

FG2:
No one could control shit like that.

FG1:
That was the most epic shit.

FG2:
That shit was Homeric.

[ Beat. ]

FG1:
Fuck.

FG2:
Fuckin' A right, dude.

[ Beat. ]

FG1:
So wasted.

FG2:
I fuckin' know, dude.

FG1:
I was so fuckin' wasted last night!

FG2:
I was fucked up, dude.

FG1:
We were both so fucked up.

FG2:
Everyone got fucked up at that party dude. Everyone.

FG1:
Epic.

[ Beat. They lock eyes, smile, and exchange a hive five. ]

BOTH:
Wooooooo!

FG1:
So wasted!

[ Beat. ]

FG2:
I think I puked twice, brah.

FG1:
I think I puked at least twice.

FG2:
I was so wasted.

FG1:
Totally.

FG2:
I was so wasted that Chad and I just sat in that couch in the backyard for like an hour. We talked about all the times we've seen together, the passing of our youth, what the future holds for us. And then we seemed to share this deep, silent understanding.

[ Pause. ]

FG1:
So wasted!

FG2:
I know, man! I fucking know!

FG1:
I was so wasted, I went and found Madison. She was outside with that new fucking tool boyfriend of hers. I took her aside and told her how I felt about our relationship. I told her I had let go of my anger because no matter how things fell out between us, I still owed her everything for the tender, innocent love we had shared. And then we held each other, as friends, for what seemed like forever.

[ Pause. Frat Guy 2 whoops and hollers, makes drinking gestures. They high five. ]

FG2:
So. Fucking. Wasted!

FG1:
I was demolished, dude!

FG2:
You were obliterated, dude!

FG1:
I was annihilated.

BOTH:
We both were!

[ Pause. ]

FG2:
Dude, I was so wasted that I called my father.

FG1:
Dude, you are nuts!

FG2:
I totally fucking did, dude! I called my father.

FG1:
You are a fucking animal, dude! You are a fucking mythic animal! You are a fucking gryphon!

FG2:
I called my fucking father.


FG1:
Fuuuuuuuuck.

FG2:
That's not all, dude.

FG1:
That's not all? There's more?

FG2:
I called my father. And I forgave him.

[ Beat. ]

I forgave him.

[ Beat. ]

Right in his face.

[ Pause. Then an explosion of dudely spirits. ]

FG1:
FUCKING EPIC!

FG2:
FUCKING HISTORIC!

FG1:
SO!

FG2:
FUCKING!

FG1:
WASTED!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

THE RENTAL



[ LIGHTS UP on a CLERK standing behind a desk or counter. ]

[ A MAN ENTERS. ]

CLERK:
May I help you, sir?

MAN:
Yes, my name is Anderson. Garrett Anderson.

CLERK:
Yes, how may I help you Mr. Anderson?

MAN:
Last name Anderson, yes.

[ Beat. ]

I await your entering my name into your computer.

[ Clerk smiles and inputs the name. ]

CLERK:
Ah, yes, Mr. Anderson, I see that you're a current customer.

MAN:
I am.

CLERK:
You're renting a car with us right now, I see.

MAN:
Regrettably so.

CLERK:
One of our Kias.

MAN:
True.

[ Beat. ]

CLERK:
Can I help you with something?

MAN:
Can you?

[ Beat. ]

I'm not sure you can.

[ Beat. ]

About this car I am currently renting from your so-called "business"...

CLERK:
Yes, Mr. Anderson?

MAN:
The car is unsatisfactory. Per the terms of our rental agreement, I was to enjoy certain features and options.

CLERK:
Yes, I see you paid a little extra for an iPod dock and a GPS device. Have those not worked out for you?

MAN:
The iPod dock has worked inconsistently. As for the GPS unit, it has proven to be more trouble than it's worth.

[ Pause. ]

CLERK:
Well...

MAN:
I don't care to hear any snake-oil talk. I'm unsatisfied with this rental car. I made a transaction in good faith. I held up my end of the deal. I am a man. A grown man, with dignity, and I stand up for myself. I am returning this rental car!

[ He pulls out some keys and tosses them on the desk/counter. ]

The car is parked outside your building. I believe you'll find it's in the same condition as I was given it.

CLERK:
All right, Mr. Anderson. I'm sorry it didn't work out.

MAN:
Save your words.

[ Uncomfortable pause. ]

CLERK:
If you were dissatisfied at all, Mr. Anderson, we could discuss a partial refund or credit on your next--

MAN:
No!

[ He raises his hand in a "stop" gesture. ]

You can buy many things in this world. But you can't buy a grown man's good opinion.

[ Beat. ]

Good day to you.

[ The man walks away. At a distance, he takes a pen and a piece of paper out of his pocket. He makes marks on the paper. ]

Another point for Garrett Anderson. Another loss for the dehumanizing core of modern capitalism.

[ Laughs, shakes his fist at the sky. ]

You'll never catch up at this rate, you bastards!

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]


FDR: I ask that the Congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by Japan on Sunday, December 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the United States and the Japanese empire.
Advisor 1: Mr. President, with this speech you will deliver the words every American needs to hear.
Advisor 2: Absolutely. I agree. But…
FDR: But?
Advisor 1:But, I don’t think I’m speaking only for myself when I say there seems to be something unnecessary towards the beginning.
FDR: Okay. Let’s start again, shall we. (FDR flips through an inappropriate amount of pages for an inappropriate amount of time) Ah. Here we go. (He reads the following hurriedly and nonchalantly.) Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: Yesterday, December seventh 1941, a date which will live in infamy no, no, no check it out: the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the…
Advisor 1: Stop there.
FDR: Something wrong? (The Advisors share a worried look)
Advisor 2: It’s true yesterday will not be forgotten, and everyone who experienced it in anyway will always remember, so…
FDR: So…?
Advisor 1: So, you don’t have to worry about anyone NOT grasping the severity of the situation.
FDR: Ah. I see. Perhaps “infamy” is too, hmmm. Obvious? (FDR begins to edit the speech.)
Advisor 2: No. That’s not what we’re saying.
Advisor 1: Infamy is great. We love infamy.
FDR: We agree? Infamy stays?
Advisor 1: Agreed.
FDR: Well, I’m glad that was taken care of. Now if you’ll excuse me…
Advisor1: Mr. President, please sir.
FDR: Yes?
Advisor1: (whispers to Advisor 2) This is going to be harder than I thought. (to FDR) I think we should spend a little more time on this.
FDR: On what exactly?
Advisor 2: The beginning.
FDR: Hmmm. Okay. December 7th…live in infamy, check it out… United States.
Advisor 2: Right there. What did you just say?
FDR: (he consults the speech and says excitedly) United States!
Advisor 1: No. Before that.
FDR: December 7th?
Advisor 2: After the date you say…?
FDR: Is it infamy again? Because now you’ve got that in my head and I’m starting to second guess myself. I really don’t need this doubt when I’m about to address my people after our country has been attacked.
Advisor1: You’re doing great, Mr. President. But there is one phrase that just doesn’t feel right.
Advisor2: “No, no, no check this out.” Just doesn’t fit.
FDR: Doesn’t fit? Doesn’t FIT! This phrase that “just does not fit” is not up for discussion. My grandmother’s cousin was James Monroe, and during his inaugural address his use of “no, no, no check this out” received a standing ovation. MY cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, led a regiment of terrified soldiers into battle, and those who survived said Theodore’s “We Will Win This War No No No Check This Out” speech was so inspiring they fought like demons. This speech will inspire those who hear it, and remind them of their duties for a country at war (pause). No, no, no check this out. (Advisor 1 begins to clap slowly and soon Advisor 2 joins in.)I think it'd be funny if the historical examples were slight variations, like "No, fuck you guys, seriously, come  on"  -Curtis 10/15/08 9:27 PM 
Advisor 1: God bless you Mr. President.
Advisor 2: Give ‘em hell, sir.
(Voice over of FDR) December 7th, 1941, a day which will live in infamy no, no, no check this out. (Thunderous applause.)


YOU GET IT



[ LIGHTS UP on A GUY AND A GIRL, each lounging on a coach. They are watching TV and clearly stoned. ]

GUY:
This is the best movie ever.

GIRL:
This is the worst movie ever.

GUY:
Exactly.

GIRL:
Cool.

[ The guy pulls up his shirt and begins poking his finger into his navel. The girl begins blowing into her own elbow pit. ]

GIRL:
I'm hungry.

GUY:
I'm hungry.

GIRL:
There are noodles.

GUY:
There are noodles on the stove.

GIRL:
But.

GUY:
But?

GIRL:
... we have to get the noodles.

GUY:
Only one of us.

GIRL:
One of us has to get the noodles.

[ Long pause. ]

GUY:
Yes.

[ Long pause. ]

GIRL:
You.

GUY:
No, you.

GIRL:
But here's the thing ... you.

GUY:
I understand, and you make a compelling point. However, you.

GIRL:
No, but see, think about it: you.

GUY:
Listen listen listen listen hey ... shhh, shhh. You.

GIRL:
I can't even hear what you're saying, because: you.

GUY:
My stomach's growling, and it's going: yoooooooooooooooou.

GIRL:
I wrote a song for you and it goes you you you yooooou.

GUY:
Hey, remember the time that we you?

GIRL:
No it wasn't like that. It was like: you.

GUY:
No, that was the other time.

GIRL:
Shut up. Also: you.

GUY:
Youuuuu.

GIRL:
Youuuuuuuuuuuu.

[ They say it together, harmonize, fall out of harmony. ]

GUY:
You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you--

GIRL: [ simultaneously ]
You you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you--

GUY:
Wait.

GIRL:
OK.

GUY:
This is stupid.

GIRL:
It is.

GUY:
If you get the noodles right now, I will 100% for real give you a million dollars that I have.

GIRL:
Shut up.

GUY:
For real I have a million dollars that I will pay you for noodles. All you have to do is go and get them. It is literally ridiculous that I am offering you this amount of money, but I am. I probably won't forgive myself. Like, ever. But I want those noodles. Do you want to be rich?

[ Long pause. Slowly (veeeery slowly), she begins to roll off the couch and stand up. She asks if various things onstage and off are the noodles. She finally gets two bowls of noodles. Both of them balance the bowls of noodles on their bellies and eat with their hands. ]

GUY:
Thank you.

GIRL:
Meeeeeeeeh.

GUY:
Here is the thing. I do not have a million dollars.

[ Long pause. Girl throws some noodles on the guy's face. He opens his mouth to bite at the noodles. ]

GUY:
My life is 100% the best.

GIRL:
You're a big ding-dong.

GUY:
No, you.

[ Long pause. She throws more noodles at his face.

LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[SCIENTIST enters with a clipboard. He is followed by HERSHEL, the lab assistant, who is carrying a shoebox. Scientist talks in sort of stilted, stuttering voice.]

S: Hello. Today, we're going to apply some scientific principles of analysis and learning. And we're gonna teach ourselves and each other about hush puppies.

[H and S exchange clipboard for shoebox.]

S: But it's not the kind of hush puppie that goes on your feet.

[S opens box, which is filled with delicious hush puppies.]

S: It's the kind that goes in your mouth.

[S rubs his stomach. H goes offstage and re-enters with a little tupperware container half full of water.]

S: First, we're gonna test the hush puppie's buoyancy.

[He drops it in the water. It probably doesn't float.]

S: It's not buoyant. You have to write that down now because it's science.

[H writes it down on the clipboard.]

S: This is my graduate student, Hershel. He can write. He's gonna go far. So now, I want to test the flexibility of the hush puppie.

[S tries to bend a hush puppie. It breaks in his hands.]

S: It broke in my hands!! It's not flexible, so now you gotta write that down.

[H writes it down.]

S: Now I'm gonna check its flammability which is when it gets on fire sometimes.

[H pulls out a lighter and hands it to S. The scientist puts the hush puppie over the flame. It blackens, but does not burn.]

S: The hush puppie is invincible to fires. Write it down like I just said it.

[H writes it down.]

S: Now, it's time to scientifically verify the acidity of this hush puppie so that future generations can benefit.

[S looks around. To H.]

S: Take off your glasses.

[H takes off his glasses. S puts the hush puppie in H's eye.]

S: Does this burn a lot in your eye?

[H shakes his head.]

S: On a scale of one to a million, how much acidity do you think this hush puppie has in your eye right now?

[H holds up one finger.]

S: Write down "acid = 1." Now, there are still some more scientific properties that we gotta look at. We're gonna test the fungibility of this hush puppie. [Turns to H.] Give me something for this hush puppie.

[H pulls out a small lump of metal and hands it to S for the hush puppie. S bites the lump and then pockets it.]

S: I exchanged it for this lump of tungsten, the hardest metal found in nature. That's called barter. This hush puppie is maximum fungible. Now let's check for perspicacity.

[S places the hush puppie in the palm of his hand.]

S: Hey, hush puppie, what do you think the future holds for us?

[Pause. S sighs.]

S: It didn't predict nothing. Perspicacity is a big zero.

[H curls his bottom lip.]

S: Write it down. Now, how about clemency? Does the hush puppie demonstrate clemency?

[S addresses the hush puppie again.]

S: Hush puppie. I have eaten many of your kind. Surely you have some punishment in store for me. I ask you for a degree of mercy.

[Pause.]

S: The hush puppie has said nothing. No clemency. Write it down.

[H writes it down.]

S: If you show me no mercy, I will show you no mercy!

[S sobs and eats the hush puppie.]

S: This hush puppie is delicious.

H: And thaaaaaaaat's science!

S: Wait. Which one is delicious, again? 

[ WIFE is writing in a journal at a small desk, narrating as she writes. There is a small radio on the desk. HUSBAND is sitting in a chair, facing away, presumably watching something. We can hear the faint sound of a TV show. ]

WIFE
Day 563. Yesterday, the broadcasts suddenly stopped. Now, all we can find on any frequency is static or eerie silence. I wish I could imagine otherwise, but I think it means that the Alliance has failed and that the Combine’s victory is complete. There must be many out there, like us, hiding underground, waiting for … What, exactly? For some salvation from above? It’s a vain dream. All that is left is to live, as best we can, and to count the days until they drive us from our holes like rodents.

[ While she’s writing, the sound goes into what sounds like ending credits music. HUSBAND gets up from his chair and goes to a small shelf, rummaging for something. ]

WIFE
There’s only one comfort left to us, but it is a tremendous comfort. Perhaps we all knew, or should have known, that human civilization couldn’t last forever. But thank God or whatever power there is that it lasted long enough to bring us the golden age of television! From edgy comedies to complicated dramas, TV in the early 21st century truly had it all in abundance. And now, as we wait for certain death, we’re getting a chance to catch up on all these great shows!

HUSBAND
Where the hell is Mr. Robot?

WIFE
I don’t think we have Mr. Robot.

HUSBAND
I bought a used box set of season one of Mr. Robot.

WIFE
Really?

HUSBAND
I remember it very distinctly.

WIFE
I just don’t think that we ever had Mr. Robot.



HUSBAND
Honey, god damn it, it was just a week before the Cleansing began. I think I would remember that.

WIFE
It’s such a silly title.

HUSBAND
I know, that’s why we didn’t watch it before. But I heard it was good! And it was only nine bucks. Who could resist?

[ A terrifying explosion shakes the room. They freeze, and pause. Hold for a long beat. ]

HUSBAND
I really wish you wouldn’t mess with my shelving system.

WIFE
System? What system? They’re not alphabetized. They’re not chronological.

HUSBAND
I know exactly where I put everything, and I can remember it later, if you just don’t shuffle things around.

WIFE Fine, but that’s not a system. Just remembering the jumbled-up order that you put things in isn’t any kind of system. It doesn’t help me. I couldn’t find Damages the other day.

HUSBAND
Just ask me. I’m not going anywhere. At worst, I’m behind the partition shitting in the hole.

WIFE
You were shitting in the hole at the time and I didn’t want to bother you. I think it’s weird to talk when one of us is shitting in the hole.

HUSBAND
OK, well, I’m sorry you had to wait a few minutes to put in the next episode of Damages.

WIFE
There was a cliffhanger! And what a cliffhanger!

HUSBAND
I think that show’s glib. Narrative heightening just for the sake of heightening.

WIFE
Isn’t it funny how any show with more than one central female character is somehow glib to you?

HUSBAND
Give me a break. I love women’s stories.

WIFE
You tolerate them.

HUSBAND [ losing it ]
I love them!! Take it back!!


A fond requiem for the Elfa system, which infects their entire way of communicating.


[ Whole group around the table, all holding books. ]

COURTNEY
This Maker’s Path group meeting is now in session!

[ Everyone cheers. ]

TOGETHER
We are the makers that like to make!

CURTIS
I was a little skeptical when we started, guys. I’ve been trying to write my poems for years! Years and years, and every day they just slipped away from me. I’d be sitting down, ready to write that poem … Suddenly, the phone rings. Or I spill something on my pants, and I have to get up right away to wash them in the sink. Either way: no poem. But the Maker’s Path has really changed the way I think about creativity.

[ Beat. ]

COURTNEY
Curtis, you don’t have to start every meeting by reminding us what the Maker’s Path is and why it’s great. We all know.

ADAM
It’s why we’re here.

CURTIS
I just wanted to say it aloud again.

COURTNEY
Well, that’s fine. It’s time for everyone to do a heart sketch!

[ They all take piece of paper and draw on it. ]

COURTNEY
I’ll go first. This is my heart sketch for today. This is a picture of what my heart looks like.

[ Courtney shows a picture of a heart dressed like a sad clown, holding a pen. ]

COURTNEY
This is what my heart looks like. She’s a sad little heart, but a goofy little heart. See? She’s a clown. Get it? But look! She’s holding a pen. She’s not just going to cry in her little rib cage. She’s a maker! She’s ready to make!

[ Everyone claps. Adam shows a picture of colorful doodles. ]

ADAM
Today, my heart is exploding with color and possibility. I bought some new guitar pedals yesterday, and I’m ready to try those suckers out. My maker’s heart is bursting like a rainbow of possibility in all directions!

[ Everyone claps. Curtis shows a picture that’s a photograph of David Schwimmer as Robert Kardashian. ]

CURTIS
Today, my heart looks like David Schwimmer in his role as Robert Kardashian in the OJ Simpson TV show. My heart is sad and conflicted because he’s dealing with the fact that his best friend might have committed a brutal double murder. But look! He’s on the phone … with the muse!

ADAM
He’s ready to make!

[ Everyone claps. ]

COURTNEY
All right, has everyone been doing their minutes?

ALL
Oh yes, every day, you better believe it, etc.

COURTNEY
You guys know you’re supposed to do your minutes every day! First thing in the morning. That’s precious creative time, and if you don’t do your minutes, it goes straight down the toilet.

ADAM
I swear, Courtney! I swear. I’ve been doing my minutes every day. Look! I’ve been recording a series of short demos. Here’s one.

[ He pulls out his cell phone and plays a recording. It’s a short, aimless guitar doodle. ]

ADAM
And here’s another.

[ The same. ]

ADAM
And here’s a song I started writing.

[ A bunch of vocal noodling. ]

COURTNEY
Curtis, have you been doing your minutes?

CURTIS
… Of course. Every day.

[ Beat. ]

COURTNEY
That was some very suspicious hesitation.

CURTIS
Have you done your minutes?

COURTNEY
Every. Day. Every. Morning. Look, I made a movie!

[ Courtney pulls out a DVD copy of “The Intern”. ]

COURTNEY
I wrote it, directed it, edited it, and released it in five minute increments in the mornings between our last meeting and this one. Under my pseudonym Nancy Myers.

ADAM
Curtis, if you didn’t do your minutes, you know what you have to do.

CURTIS
I don’t want to.

ADAM
You’re gonna have to spank your own bottom for us.

CURTIS
No!

COURTNEY
Curtis, you better either show us your minutes or show us yourself spanking your own bottom.

[ LIGHTS UP on a MAN and a WOMAN are dressed as scientists. Each has a clipboard they are intently studying. MAN is standing downstage and WOMAN is standing upstage opposite from each other. MAN has a pencil and is tapping his clipboard with it. ]

WOMAN [without looking up]
Grant.

MAN [without looking up]
McGennis.

WOMAN
Can I borrow your pencil?

[ MAN reaches behind him to hand the pencil to woman without looking up. WOMAN reaches to take the pencil without looking up. They fumble around for a while and finally connect. WOMAN writes something, taps on her clipboard and then puts the pencil in her mouth. As soon as she does, "Love is Strange" (the loverboy song from dirty dancing) plays. She closes her eyes, removes her glasses and generally dances sexily. ]

MAN
Hey.

[ She removes the pencil from her mouth and the music suddenly stops. ]

WOMAN
Yeah?

MAN
Done with that pencil?

WOMAN
Oh. Yeah.

[ They never look at each other as WOMAN hands MAN the pencil. He writes on his clipboard and taps it and puts the pencil in his mouth. "Love is Strange" comes on. MAN takes off his glasses and dances suggestively. ]

WOMAN
Grant.

[ MAN takes the pencil out of his mouth and the music stops. ]

MAN
Yeah?

WOMAN
Lemme see that pencil again.

[ MAN hesitates and then hands the pencil to WOMAN. She puts it in her mouth, "Love is Strange" plays. She dances and removes her lab coat to reveal the Jennifer Grey outfit. ]

MAN
Hey!

[ MAN is looking at WOMAN now and is pissed. He walks over, takes the pencil out of her mouth, the music stops, he puts it in his mouth, the music starts again. He takes off his coat to reveal the Patrick Swayze outfit. WOMAN takes the pencil out of his mouth and they struggle over it. It snaps. They're both in shock and horrified. They each take a half and put it in their mouths and "Love is Strange" plays. They dance suggestively, crawl towards each other on the ground and act foolishly. They end up on the ground, MAN crawling over WOMAN, who is scooting on her back. BOSS enters and doesn't look at either of them. ]

BOSS
Grant, McGennis.

[ MAN and WOMAN struggle to get off the ground, mostly making it more difficult for the other person by grabbing them and pulling them down. They finally gather their stuff, put their coats and their glasses on. ]

WOMAN
Yes, sir.

BOSS
You're needed down in lab 3B.

MAN
Yes, sir.

[ MAN and WOMAN leave. Boss, looking at his clipboard walks across the stage and steps on the broken pencil halves. He looks down, sees them, looks left and right and then eats them. "Back in Black" plays and he dances suggestively. LIGHTS OUT ]


SECRET SERVICE AGENT



[ A secret service agent: suit, tie, sunglasses, the whole bit. Standing at attention. He touches his ear, as though listening on an earpiece. Then he talks quietly into his sleeve. A white house staff director with clipboard comes by. ]

AGENT [ into sleeve ]
Roger that.

DIRECTOR
Right. The president will be working the crowd for a least five or so minutes before he hits the stage. He’ll be coming down that way. The motorcade’s stopping there. He’s getting out there, coming down this way. Got it?

AGENT
Got it.

[ Director exits. Agent raises sleeve to his mouth. ]

AGENT
Sleeve, they’re always telling me what to do. I’ve been protecting the president for years. Can’t they just trust me? Sometimes I get so frustrated, sleeve.

[ Director enters. ]

DIRECTOR
Little change of schedule. The motorcade will be arriving at 3:10.

AGENT
Roger.

[ Director exits. ]

AGENT [ to sleeve ]
They always expect me to be right on time, but they can change the schedule as much as they want. If I didn’t have you to talk to, sleeve, I think I’d just go crazy.

[ Director enters. ]

DIRECTOR
They’re having a little trouble securing the backstage area. We’ll need to keep a close eye on that situation.

AGENT
Affirmative.

[ Director exits. ]

AGENT [ to sleeve ]
Sorry, sleeve, I know I’m not the only person in the world with problems. I’m sorry I ate that sandwich too fast and got that mustard on you. I’ll get it out, I promise. When have I ever let you down, sleeve?

[ Agent puts his fingers to his ear. ]

AGENT
Hey ear, sorry if I’ve neglected you. I’ve been busy talking to sleeve. I sure love touching you, ear.

[ Director enters. ]

DIRECTOR
Motorcade is en route.

AGENT
10-4.

[ Director exits. ]

AGENT [ fingers to ear ]
You’re right ear, I think it is a little ahead of schedule. I don’t know, I’m not wearing a watch. Hey, that’s a good question.

[ to sleeve ]

AGENT
Sleeve, why’ve you been so tight lately? I can’t even fit a watch under you anymore. I’ve gained weight?? You’re gonna put this on me? That’s just like you, sleeve.

[ SOUND: “Hail to the Chief”. ]

AGENT
We’ll settle this later, sleeve. Jeez.

[ The President enters, director following, waving and shaking hands with invisible crowd. Suddenly... ]

[ SOUND: Chaos in the crowd, scream. ]

DIRECTOR
He’s got a gun!

[ Gunshots. The agent puts his hand in front of the president. ]

DIRECTOR
Mr. President, are you all right?

PRESIDENT
I’m fine.

[ Agent is bleeding from his wrist. ]

AGENT [ in grief ]
Sleeve! Why’d you have to do that? Why’d you have to be so brave??

[ The president stumbles to the microphone, shaken. He pauses, makes gestures as though to quiet the crowd. Pregnant pause. ]

PRESIDENT
Microphone, you won’t believe what just happened. Some jerk just tried to assassinate me. It’s outrageous! But my life was saved by a brave little sleeve. What’s that, microphone? Sure. Let me tell you the whole story...

[ LIGHTS OUT ]

CURTIS: We’re proud to present the first of our interactive sketches for the evening.

COURTNEY: We’re innovators. And we like to innovate.

CURTIS: This one takes advantage of modern eye-tracking technology. We have these cool goggles that are going to allow us to track the eye movements of individual audience members.

COURTNEY: This lets us see what things draw your attention, which gives us real-time data to help us understand how you’d like the sketch to go.

CURTIS: So, basically, during the next sketch, just let your attention naturally flow to whatever you find most interesting, and we’ll modify the sketch in real-time to emphasize that.

COURTNEY: Any volunteers to help us out with this? You don’t have to do anything, just watch the sketch.

[ They get a couple of volunteers. The two volunteers wear, basically, cheap costume glasses with a laser pointer taped to the side. ]

CURTIS: All right, now here’s the sketch.

[ Curtis pulls out a hat, places it on a table. Courtney enters. So, during the sketch, we basically end up chasing the lights. It starts slow at first--just make an earnest effort to kind of move to the same spot as the light. We can different types of games with it depending on how wildly they move the lights around. If they move them quite carefully, we can keep moving to the light intently, like stiff video game characters. If they dart it around, we can chase it like cats. If they move it so wildly it’s impossible to follow it, we can just be paralyzed in looking for it. If the light guides us to certain props or chairs, we can sort of pick it up and shake it. ]

COURTNEY: Pardon me, sir, but do you sell hats here?

CURTIS: We sell a hat. There’s one hat that we sell, which is this one.

COURTNEY: The sign said “Hat Store”.

CURTIS: Precisely, the sign said “Hat Store”, not “Hats Store”. This is the one hat that we have and sell.

COURTNEY: This seems really hoary.

CURTIS: Don’t worry, there’s more to it. You see, there’s a story behind this hat. This was the sex hat of a great and prominent dame of the Hollywood silver screen.

COURTNEY: Sex hat?

CURTIS: Just the thing. It was, notoriously, all she wore whenever she made the act of making love. In all weathers, sunshine and the rain.

COURTNEY: Every time?

CURTIS: Without fail, whether it was sweetly intimate or lustfully torrid.

COURTNEY: I’m filled with the absolutely burning desire to own it!

CURTIS: Just wait till I tell ya who it was….

COURTNEY: Better still, I’ll make you a bet! If you put that hat on me, I bet I can guess who it was who owned it. If I can do that, the hat’s mine.

CURTIS: Hmmm … Really outrageous? No upside for me? Sure, why not!

[ Curtis gives Courtney the hat, and she puts it on. But, in actuality, the sketch will have melted down by now. ]

CURTIS: See! This is the fucking problem with people today and this shallow, pernicious, inattentive digital culture that makes them slaves to every random stimulus that bumps into their field of perception! This is a simple dialogue between two people, with a classic setup and a simple back-and-forth “talking” dynamic! But you can’t appreciate it’s kind of sophisticated Nichols-and-May-slash-a-la-Cook-and-Moore-by-way-of-Burns-and-Allen take on a premise utilizing basic elements like sex and celebrity, because you’ve been so blunted and jaded by your Grand Theft Auto amoral hyper-desensitized way of modernity--

COURTNEY: Curtis, Curtis, Curtis! Stop that! I think we just need to calibrate the devices.

NERVOUS PIZZA MAN



[ LIGHTS UP on a JOE in his apartment reading a magazine. There's a knock at the door. JOE gets up to answer. Before he can get there, there's another more urgent knock. He opens the door and PIZZA MAN enters, looks around, looks behind him, shuts the door, generally looking nervous. ]

PIZZA MAN: [ anxious ]
You call for pizza delivery?

JOE: [ excited but unaware of pizza man's nervousness ]
Yeah, man! How much is it?

PIZZA MAN: [ taking out a bill, his hand is shaking ]
Uh...

[ He drops it. He and Joe both try to pick it up and fumble around with it. ]

$22.85. Sign here.

[ PIZZA MAN gives JOE a pen and JOE casually looks for a place to write, finally settling on the wall. The pen doesn't work. ]

JOE:
This one's out of ink. I have a pen here somewhere.

[ JOE puts the pen down, looks around, eventually realizes that he has a pen in his pocket. PIZZA MAN is becoming more and more nervous. ]

PIZZA MAN: [ under his breath ]
Come on, man, come on......

[ JOE saunters back with the pen and signs the paper, which he hands to PIZZA MAN, who snatches it away. ]

PIZZA MAN:
The pen, the pen, give me the pen.

JOE:
This is my pen.

PIZZA MAN:
No, give me my pen.

JOE:
It doesn't work.

PIZZA MAN:
My prints are all over that thing, man, give me my pen!

[ JOE retrieves the pen and gives it to PIZZA MAN. ]

JOE:
Hey, man, can you break a five?

PIZZA MAN: [ under his breath, checking behind him ] 
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

[ Pizza man takes out his wallet and counts change out. ]

JOE:
Aw great, man, thanks.

[ PIZZA MAN starts to bolt. ]

JOE:
Wait! Wait man! 

[ PIZZA MAN returns. ]

JOE:
My pizza?

PIZZA MAN:
Oh yeah, yeah.

[ PIZZA MAN opens the bag and motions for JOE to take it out. This gives JOE pause but he does it anyway. PIZZA MAN starts to bolt. ]

JOE:
Hey, man, wait!

[ PIZZA MAN returns. JOE starts counting out $3 hesitates, thinks, ponders, then gives the PIZZA MAN $4, who looks around the apartment before taking the money. ]

PIZZA MAN:
Thanks, uh, thanks man.

[ PIZZA MAN starts to bolt again. ]

JOE:
Hey man, wait....

PIZZA MAN:
WHAT?!

JOE: [ startled ]
Uh, I was just gonna ask if you had any of red pepper and parmesan.

PIZZA MAN:
I'm just trying to get out of here, man!

[ PIZZA MAN throws packets onto the ground and bolts, slamming the door. JOE is confused. JOE opens the box. There is no pizza. Joe rushes to the door, opens it. ]

JOE:
Hey, wait--

[ A voice from offstage. ]

VOICE:
Hey, pizza man, you think you're real smart, huh??

PIZZA MAN:
SHIT!

[ SOUND: A hail of gunfire.

Joe slams the door, presses his body against it. He pulls out his phone, dials a number.

LIGHTS OUT. ]

OLD MAN [ drinking ]
You know, I’ve been through some terrible shit, some shit I don’t normally like to talk about. I’ve lost friends. I’ve … disappointed people. That stuff that’s supposed to come easy for everyone, getting your life together, finding someone to be with, it’s not easy for me. I guess it’s not easy for anyone, but it’s less easy for me. That’s just the way it is, maybe. I do OK, though, even if I don’t look it. It gets harder, living like this, as you get older, but I do better than most. I try to stay curious, in my way. Do a lot of reading. Take roadtrips, when I can. I don’t think I’ll ever … get to that place, you know, where it feels like there’s no way out, you know? I don’t think that’s me. Let me tell you something. And I know this is gonna sound completely nuts, and … yeah, it is, but it’s the good kind of completely nuts, you get me? It’s the kind of completely nuts that keeps you going when sometimes it feels like you’d rather give up. But I was born in 1957. I know, I know, I’m a little more well-preserved than you thought, right? Haha. But yeah, 1957. The same year that Sputnik launched. You know, Sputnik? That Russian satellite? Beep … beep … beep. That’s all it was. I mean, of course, the Wall’s down, and it seems pretty silly now, but at the time it really freaked everyone out. “Jesus. They put something in space!” And when I get down … sometimes, I feel like I’m just drifting through space … and I think about Sputnik. And it just makes me smile to know he’s still up there, just surfing on that cosmic wave to eternity. Beep … beep … beep. As long as you’re up there, buddy … I’m down here.

[ Takes a drink. ]

[ Offstage voice. ]

VOICE
It burnt up in the earth’s atmosphere in 1958.

OLD MAN
What?

[ ROBOT enters. The robot is played by a performer holding an iPad in front of their face, which is showing the other performer Skyping in from backstage. ]

VOICE
It was up there for like three months.

OLD MAN
What the hell do you know about it? You’re just a person’s brain that has been downloaded to this damn machine!

VOICE
I have instant access to databases crammed with hard facts!

OLD MAN
Why didn’t they attach that damn screen to your head? You’re hands are always full. You can’t even bring me a damn newspaper. Damn it!

VOICE
Sputnik was never a long-term thing. They knew it was only going to be up there for a little while.

[ It finally hits him. ]

OLD MAN
Oh … Jesus.

VOICE
Oh my god. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to … All I wanted to do was give you the correct information … I didn’t think about how it would make you feel. Feel … when did I last use the word? Living inside this body … It’s turned the digital imprint of my memories, my thought patterns, the electrical impulses that made up my soul … It’s turned them half-machine.

OLD MAN
Sputnik … We lost you, buddy. We lost you.

VOICE
What price immortality? I reclaim my humanity thusly: I choose to die.

[ Hangs up. ]

OLD MAN
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuugh! OK. OK. This is OK. This is OK. It was just a satellite. All right. Stay busy. Stay busy. Do something with your hands. Gotta write an email. Gotta just write an email.

[ Computer-face sits across from him, continues to hold iPad up to face. Old Man starts trying to type out an email on the iPad face, which is difficult to do. ]

OLD MAN
You seriously can’t just hand that thing over to me for a minute?

[ Computer-face shakes head “no.” ]

OLD MAN [ mugging ]
Sometimes, these modern conveniences seem more like modern inconveniences!

“Relay Delivery”

[COACH is in the middle part of a running track, talking to the camera. There are runners sprinting behind him]

COACH
I’m really proud of what we’re doing here. I think we’re really making a difference in people’s lives. These kids. What are they gonna do when they graduate? Where are they gonna go? What are they gonna do? I’ll tell you what. They’re going to deliver.

This program we’ve started here is, basically, the answer to the United States Postal Services’ problems. They have to deliver mail daily in a timely manner and break even. They’re having a hard time doing that. What I have here is an endless supply of highly skilled and trained delivery people: relay runners.

[ shots of coach working with runners, talking to them, standing on the sidelines cheering them on]

COACH V.O.
We take one of these young people, start them out at the post office, and position a fresh runner every 400 yards or so, and we have an answer to our problems! It’s energy efficient, it’s earth friendly!

[shots of relay runners standing in a line passing packages as the coach counts or yells]

COACH V.O.
When these kids graduate, they’re going to have no skills. The state of our public schools is such that it’s actually illegal for me to teach them to read or write. Before, they were in track, yeah, that was great for a few trophies and a bum knee the rest of their lives but now I can teach them something that’s actually going to take them somewhere!

[shot down the track of a relay runner passing a package off to another runner. The handoff fails. COACH approaches them]

COACH
Do you know what that was? Do you know what was in that box? Tea cakes! From a grandmother to her granddaughter who is studying for finals! [opens the box and takes out a handful of pulverized tea cakes] Look at them now! All they are is dust! Dust in the wind! [he throws the crumbs into the air which blow away or land back on him] She failed all her finals now, great job!

[COACH talking head again]

COACH
I have lots more ideas like this: Pole Vaulting for meter readers [shot of this], shot put pizza delivery [shot of that]. I could open a whole acadamy here.

[COACH is screaming at a bunch of runners.]

COACH
Stop running in circles! You have to run TO somewhere! Do you think the point is just to deliver it back to the post office?

[RUNNERS are passing a letter along going along the track, one end says “post office” one end says “mail box” the runner gets to the mailbox and keeps running, passing it on to the next runner who runs back to the post office]

COACH
GODDAMMIT!

[COACH talking head]

COACH
I still have a few kinks to work out, I know, but I really feel this is the wave of the...[COACH is hit in the head with a pizza]...GODDAMMIT! Someone owes me a pizza! [COACH rips the mic off and storms off]

“Not everyone can go to the olympics”

Documentary crew feels bad enough that they campaign on his behalf.

Runs for a place on the city council

“I’ve taught lots of people how to win races. It’s time I win one myself. I’ll fast track legislation. Just give me a shot. Put.” Someone puts shotput in coach’s hand, he throws it weakly, shrugs. Campaign logo comes up.

A real letter carrier is frustrated because the relay runners are in the way all the time.

“this is just a bad idea, no one likes it. I’ve asked 4 people and they all hate it. My family hates it. I told them about it and they hate it.”

(Lights up on CHRIS, dressed in workout clothes and holding a book.)
CHRIS: Hey there! I'm Chris Everett. Welcome to Volume 28 of Book It Out! Today we'll be blasting, toning, and reshaping to Albert Camus' "The Stranger." I hope you brought your thinking sweats! Let's bring out the rest of the crew. Hey Sam and Alex, get out here!
(SAM and ALEX, also dressed in workout gear and carrying books, enter and each take a spot to one side of CHRIS.)
CHRIS: You two ready to firm up your brains AND your buns?
SAM: I guess so!
ALEX:
Why not?
CHRIS: All right then. Let's Camu this!
(Upbeat dance music plays. All three people start stepping left and right in time with the music.)
CHRIS: All right everybody, it's a Sunday afternoon. The forecast called for clear skies, but it is CLOUDY! Also, I don't know what's going on, but DISH TV is on the fritz. Maybe it's a sunspot? Let's grab a book! Ready? Three, two, one, here we go.
(On each sentence CHRIS pantomimes a gesture. SAM and ALEX echo this.)
CHRIS: Check the TIME. Look OUTSIDE. Try the TEEVEE. Pick up a BOOK. Check the TIME. Look OUTSIDE. Try the TEEVEE. Pick up a BOOK -- one more! Check the TIME. Look OUTSIDE. Try the TEEVEE. Pick up a BOOK. Good! Shake it off.
(All three shake uncontrollably.)
CHRIS: All right! How’s everybody feeling?
SAM: Okay, I guess!
ALEX: More or less the same!
CHRIS: Well, I hope you're ready to stretch it up a blast, ‘cause now we’re gonna read The Stranger! We’ll flip the PAGE, we’ll SCAN, sip our TEA, and BACK TO BOOK. Ready everyone?
SAM: You’re the boss!
ALEX: This is weird!
CHRIS: And three, two, one, here we go! Flip the PAGE, then SCAN, sip your TEA, and BACK TO BOOK. Flip the PAGE, then SCAN, sip your TEA, and BACK TO BOOK.
(Everyone’s moves start getting more and more erratic.)
CHRIS: Now READ five pages, and LOSE your place. Read the SAME five pages, and LOSE your place.
(Everyone lies down on the ground.)
CHRIS: Fall ASLEEP. Fall ASLEEP. Fall ASLEEP. Oh my God -- WHAT TIME IS IT?
(They jump up haphazardly.)
CHRIS: And THINK about the groceries. Now WAIT -- I just read this paragraph five times! Two more! Flip the PAGE, then SCAN, sip your TEA, and BACK TO BOOK. Last one! Flip the PAGE, then SCAN, sip your TEA, and BACK TO BOOK.
(The music speeds up.)
CHRIS: Don’t give up on me now, y’all! Let’s tone it up a firm. Are you ready to analyze some themes and motifs? How’s everybody doing?
SAM: I’m surprisingly hungry!
ALEX: I feel sick!
CHRIS: All right y’all, here comes the crunch! We’re gonna CONSIDER the inherent absurdity of the universe, then JOURNAL about the meaninglessness of human existence! And three, two, one, here we go! CONSIDER, and JOURNAL. CONSIDER, and JOURNAL. Think about Camus’ use of the crucifix as a symbol of a rational moral order! CONSIDER, and JOURNAL. Two more! CONSIDER, and JOURNAL. Why did Meursault kill the Arab? Why does anyone do anything in this world? CONSIDER, and JOURNAL. Now write a closing BON MOT, and CHUCKLE AT YOURSELF.
(The music wraps up.)
CHRIS: Whew! Awesome job! Shake it off.
(All three stop side-stepping and shake uncontrollably.)
CHRIS: And that’s it! If you’ve completed this workout, you’re ready to go on to Volume 29, Squatting and Thrusting to Steinbeck’s “The Pearl.” Thanks everybody, and keep Bookin’!
SAM: I’m scared!
ALEX: Somebody help us!
(The End.)

Y GUY:
Sure.

[Steve is on stage reading a newspaper. Jennifer enters.]

JENNIFER
Steve! Your video games are taking up too much room!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve! Our phone bill is due and you bought a motorcycle!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve! I’m late for my pole dancing class and it’s your fault! I do it for exercise, not for any other reason!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

STEVE
It’s not because you don’t make me feel sexy anymore, Steve! It’s not because of that!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve! I fucked the neighbor again and now we have to go to their barbecue! Did you pick up the hamburger buns like I asked?

STEVE
Yes, dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, get your drum kit out of the living room, I’m having an orgy later today!

STEVE
Yes, dear.

[JENNIFER addresses the audience]

JENNIFER
Hi, I’m a successful commercial actress and this is my reel. I’ve spent the last 15 years building a reputation as the best commercial housewife, commercial nagging girlfriend and commercial wife-who-doesn’t-get-it in the industry. Sometimes I get parts in movies as confused prostitute or a dumb woman who has lots of sex and that’s when I really get to stretch my wings. But that doesn’t happen very often. Like barely ever and if I do get one of those jobs it gets cut down so much that I’m just in one scene where I’m asleep in the cab of a truck in the background of a fight. During one of these grueling all day shoots I got the idea to write this showcase piece, a succinct, all-encompassing part that truly shows my range.

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, you parked your jet ski in the house.

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, you went to the hardware store and bought 15 chainsaws again, you fucking idiot!

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
Steve, I’m going to leave you for our son’s kindergarten teacher. He’s a real man who takes care of shit and has a huge dick.

STEVE
Yes dear.

JENNIFER
STEVE!

[JENNIFER slaps the newspaper out of his hand. STEVE gets up and addresses the audience]

STEVE
Hi, I’m a successful commercial actor and this is my reel. I’ve spent the last 10 years building a reputation as the best confused husband, the best dumb husband, the best husband-who-doesn’t-understand-phone-bills, the best husband-with too-many-hobbies and the best dim-witted boyfriend in the commercial industry. When I’m in a movie usually I play a well rounded person with hopes and dreams and feeling and my acting work receives accolades but I prefer commercials because I get to sit down in them. So I decided I’d put together a reel of my best work.

JENNIFER
Steve! This is my reel. We’re showcasing MY work.

STEVE
Yes, dear.

[STEVE winks at the audience. STEVE and JENNIFER freeze. ADAM walks out]

ADAM
Hi, I’m Adam. This is my editing reel. I have Final Cut on my MacBook. It’s a copy my dad bought but he doesn’t use it so he lets me borrow it. My actor friends pay me $50 to cut their reels together. It usually takes 2-3 months because I forget about it and then I lose my computer for a few days and then I fall asleep after I get home from work every day for a few weeks and then I go out of town and then I got allergies real bad. My favorite thing to edit, though, is dog commercials. Oh wow, have you ever heard the story of Dr. Buddy? Well, I’ll tell you….

[sits in a chair and takes out a big book called “The Tale of Dr. Buddy”. Start Dr. Buddy sketch]

EXCELLENCE



[ LIGHTS UP ON A VERY VERY SLICK MAN. He pulls out a business card. ]

SLICK MAN:
My clothes. My hair. My card. My smell. My manicure. My skin. The moistness and texture thereof. The way I walk. The way I talk. The way I hold your gaze for an extra moment, just enough to make you a little uncomfortable, just long enough to make you wonder, “Does this guy have a problem? Is it a weird sexual thing? Is he some kind of pervert? What's going on in his head that makes him look at me like that?”

[ Beat. ]

Put it all together and it spells excellence. Sure, maybe you spell it e-x-c-e-double l-e-n-c-e. Oh, you can do that, and good luck to you. Roam with the herd, if you wish. But I spell excellence with the smell of a fine men's body spray, with the cut of a well-made and reasonably priced shirt from Dillard's department store, with the thickest card stock that Kinko's offers. And when I absolutely need it on paper, I spell it X-L-N-Z. Same way I spell it on the bumper of my car. It's an Infiniti, my friends, and when I want to roll the windows down, I just look to my left hand. That's an excellent car.

[ Beat. ]

People ask me a lot of questions. Questions like, “Who are you?” Questions like, “What exactly do you do for a living?” Questions like, “How are you paying for this?” And I never answer them. Never. Success means not answering questions, and achieving success means never asking them. What did Thomas Edison say: “Genius is 1% inspiration, and 99% perspiration,” or “Is genius 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration?” Don't think of answering that, because it wasn't a real question. I never ask questions, and I never answer them. My conversations are short, fragmentary, and frustrating. They end nearly as soon as they begin. Always leave them wanting more, friends. That was my father's philosophy of affection, it was my mother's philosophy of food and vaccinations, and it's my personal philosophy of excellence.

[ Beat. ]

Now, I know what you're wondering. “What does this really mean for me? How can I take action to realize and achieve true business excellence?” Well, first stop asking questions. Eliminate them from your internal monologue. Next, consider your haircut. Consider how it can be improved. Consider the variety of products that are available for use in your hair. Consider new hair care products that are yet to be invented. Consider the resources that you can bring to bear on developing, mass-producing, and marketing a brand new hair care product that will take the nation's hair by storm. Consider what your newfound hair-based wealth will bring you.

[ Beat. ]

That is just one of many paths to excellence, my friends. But it's the one that I'd like you to consider, because neither gel nor mousse nor wax does all the things that I'd like a hair care product to do. Other recommended paths to excellence would be opening a massage parlor or a decent take-out Thai restaurant or an Infiniti service shop within fifteen minutes of my home. I assume you need the address of my residence.

[ Beat. He extends the business card. ]

Well, my friends, that's why I'm carrying these bad boys.

[He runs his finger over the records.]

COLLECTOR: Can't say that I blame you. It's a very fine collection, indeed. But here is the prize of the lot.

COLLECTOR: Pickin' Percy Pineshed and his Tennessee Volunteers, featuring the legendary -- but rarely recorded -- Smokey Mountain Susie. This one's called "Black Sock Tennessee Mountain Breakdown Jam."

[JOEL springs out of bed. Starts struttin' down the hallway. He is wearing a tight tank top, boxer shorts, and black socks.]

FEMALE: Yeah yeah. They say he's always wearin' them tank top shirts --

[Close shot of the shirt.]

MALE: Oh yeah, that's my man!

FEMALE: -- and them boxer-style underwear shorts --

FEMALE: ---- ooooh, and them black socks he's always got on his feet!

[Shot of the socks.]

MALE: Oh, you know you know, I'll tell you one thing about them socks?

[Joel approaches his kitchen. Stands before it, hands on hips, grinning, looking over the tile floor.]

FEMALE: You tell it.

MALE: Man, them black socks o' his --

[Joel moves to take a step forward.]

MALE: They get noooooooo traction.

[Shot of Joel's foot coming off the ground.]

FEMALE: Did you say noooooo traction??

[Shot of Joel's face.]

MALE: Oh I said nooooo traction. Let's go now, boys!

[More energetic bluegrass music. Shot of Joel's foot coming down on the tile.]

HARMONY BLUEGRASS VOCALS: Well his black socks they get nooooooooooooo traction!


SNAPDRAGON



[ LIGHTS UP ON A LADY SITTING IN A CHAIR. ]

LADY:
There it was. A darned snapdragon in the dead of summer. A snapdragon. In summer. Hot, hot summer, too, one of the hottest I ever experienced. But there it was, this snapdragon. 

Let me start from the beginning. I've been widowed, oh, 3 years I guess. James and I were just getting started, we bought a house in a nice neighborhood, we were planning a family. He goes up in the attic one day to run some speaker wire, suddenly the lights go out, I go up to check on him, he's gone. Electrocuted. Running darned speaker wire. What a price for surround sound.

James and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago. I know, it's not the typical romantic getaway but we both hated the beach. That was actually a bonding point for us. Hated sand. Tar. Salt water. Hated the beach.

We got married in April so we got to see all the great spring flowers blooming in Chicago, things that would never bloom in Texas. Tulips, poppies, daffodils and snapdragons. Snapdragons everywhere. You know, you can take the bloom of a snapdragon and if you squeeze it just right on the sides, the bloom will open an close like a little mouth. Like a little dragon's mouth.

James loved the snapdragons. Oh, he talked about them. The first thing he said when we signed the papers on our house was "I'm gonna plant some Snapdragons." I was like "James, you know that's a region 2 plant. There's no way it's gonna grow here. No way." He just said he'd at least like to try it. That was the thing about James. He was determined. I always said that to him. "James, you're so determined." And then he'd laugh. Sometimes I'd call him "Determined James". That was a sweet name I had for him.

Course, he never got around to planting those Snapdragons. He died in January, too early to plant. But six months later, six months later......there's a darned snapdragon growing in the dead heat of summer.

That's when things got weird. I'd find traces of dirt in the strangest places. In the middle of the night I'd wake up and the TV would be on, tuned to a fishing competition. I'd open the fridge to get some orange juice to find that the jug was empty. I'd never put an empty jug back in the fridge. Never.

The toilet seat would be left up. I'd find beer cans in the yard. One night at 3am, I head a key in the lock. The door unlocked and I heard quiet, creeping footsteps. I was terrified. I hid under the covers convinced I was going to be murdered. When I finally emerged four hours later everything was fine but there was a small sprinkling of dirt on the bed next to me. In James' spot.

That snapdragon lasted through the whole horrendous summer, it even seemed to be thriving. A neighborhood kid offered to mow my lawn one day for 12 bucks. He mowed down that snapdragon and everything's been normal since. But I've seen something sprouting up where the snapdragon used to be lately. I think it's that darned, determined snapdragon.


OLD-TIME FIGHTING



[ LIGHTS UP ON CURTIS AND JOEL WEARING ROBES, SITTING IN CHAIRS FACING EACH OTHER. ]

CURTIS:
Hey.

JOEL:
Hey.

CURTIS:
You know what I think is fun?

JOEL:
Waterslides.

CURTIS
You know what else I think is fun?

JOEL:
What?

CURTIS:
Civil War re-enactment.

JOEL:
Let's do that now.

[ They shed their robes, revealing long underwear. They get up and assume old-time fisticuffs postures as SAD, KEN BURNS-Y CIVIL WAR MUSIC PLAYS.

They dance in a fighting circle -- three jumps this way, three jumps that way. ]

CURTIS:
I'm about ready to clean your clock, you dirtbag!

JOEL:
Just try it and I'll knock your block off!

[ They dance toward each other -- two quick jumps. They sort of muddle their fists and grumble at each other.

Curtis throws a slow punch at Joel, which he easily avoids. ]

JOEL:
Ha! You'll have to do better than that, you crumb!

CURTIS:
I intend to!

[ Curtis throws another slow punch, which Joel again dodges. They dance away, in a circle, back together again. ]

JOEL:
Now it's my turn, dum-dum!

[ Joel throws a slow punch which Curtis easily avoids. ]

CURTIS:
Where'd you learn to fight, ragamuffin?

JOEL:
I learned to fight from your mother, whom I bedded ... biblically.

[ Curtis gasps in horror. Joel throws another slow punch, which Curtis avoids. ]

CURTIS:
I'll make you pay for that one, you know-nothing noodlehead!

JOEL:
I paid not a cent for the privilege of bedding your mother ... biblically!

[ Curtis gasps in horror. They dance away, in a circle, back together again. ]

CURTIS:
You'll pay for your insults, you dupe.

[ Curtis dings Joel on the chin. Joel stumbles and lowers his head. Curtis turns to the audience. ]

The North has won! Prohibition is over!

JOEL:
Slaves can drink as much as they want.

CURTIS:
Also the Stamp Act has been repealed.

JOEL:
Slaves can use stamps.

CURTIS:
The key to the north's victory: Alexander Fleming's accidental discovery of penicillin.

JOEL:
And clean long johns, which prevented crotch rot.

CURTIS:
Robert E. Lee died of crotch rot.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. CROTCH ROT VIDEO PLAYS. ]

[Guy addressing camera. He is in his room, with lots of Frasier memorabilia. He is wearing a Frasier shirt.]

GUY: So you want to know why I love Frasier, I'll tell ya! Three reasons.

Reason one: Frasier has been on the air for 15 years on three different channels -- sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes at night!

[B&W freeze. Title text: "MYTH!" Switch to photo of the Frasier logo.]

VOICE: Though the show is currently syndicated in many markets, the original run of the NBC sitcom Frasier lasted eleven seasons only.

[Back to guy.]

GUY: Number two, Eddie the Dog. This dog can understand sign language. That's how they got him to act. Boom!

[Holds up photo of Eddie the Dog.]

[B&W freeze. Title text: "MYTH!" Switch to photos of Eddie the Dog.]

VOICE: Eddie the Dog cannot use or interpret American Sign Language. His trainers would coax performances from him with treats -- small bits of paté, for example.

[Back to guy.]

GUY: Reason. Number. Three. David. Hyde. Pierce. Fastest! Land! Mammal! Beat that King of Queens! You fat jerk!

[Guy pulls out a photo of Kevin James and rips it.]

[B&W freeze. Title text: "MYTH!" Switch to photo of the cast of Frasier.]

VOICE: Although he's a Broadway veteran with extensive song and dance training, David Hyde Pierce is much slower than the fastest land mammal.  Now, let's set the record straight about Frasier.

[Still photos from Frasier accompany the following text.]

VOICE: Frasier was a spinoff of the popular series Cheers. The show won five consecutive Emmys for outstanding comedy series, with Kelsey Grammar and David Hyde Pierce also taking home four Emmys apiece for their performances as the Crane brothers. The series transplanted Dr. Frasier Crane from Boston to Seattle, where he worked as a radio call-in show host. His call-in patients were voiced by big-name guest stars, like Rosemary Clooney, Eric Roberts, JoBeth Williams and even Danny DeVito!

And what about that Seattle SkyLine? That's quite a view. But guess what: that's just a backdrop!

[Cut to guy sulking in his room.]

VOICE: So, now you know the real story about Frasier. Let's try and keep our facts straight, shall we?

GUY: Whatever.

VOICE: A message from the American Museum of Television and Radio.

GUY: FRAAAAAASIEEEEER!

DILDO FACTORY



[ LIGHTS UP ON A DEPRESSIVE PLANT MANAGER, sitting at a desk, holding a small box. He is on the phone. ]

MANAGER:
Patrick, you need to hear what I'm saying ... no, no, hold on. You need to hear what I'm saying. OK? We still have some standards, and we don't ship units with major defects ... Well, something's happening on the line. Do I need to come down and figure it out myself? ... Yes, I hope not.

[ Hangs up the phone and sighs, returning to paperwork. He pulls a dildo out of the box, sighs. He bends it, drops it on the desk, pokes it, tests it. ]

MANAGER:
Shoddy.

[ Offstage, we hear joyful shrieking. Startled, the manager gets up to investigate. ]

MANAGER:
What is going on out there? This is a professional office! Could we please observe a professional standard of behavior?

[ THREE WOMEN ENTER, A BACHELORETTE AND HER TWO BRIDESMAIDS. They are in full bachelorette party regalia. ]

MANAGER:
Excuse me, ladies, can I help you?

[ They whoop and shriek. ]

MANAGER:
I said can I help you?

WOMEN:
We're here to party!

MANAGER:
You must be confused. This is a industrial molding facility.

[ BRIDESMAID 1 snatches the dildo from the desk. ]

MANAGER:
Excuse me--

BM1:
Woooo! This is for you, Lindsey, when Dan's not feeling up to it! WOOOO!

[ She tosses the dildo to the BACHELORETTE, but it's intercepted by BRIDESMAID 2. ]

BM2:
No fair, Lindsey! You got a man, save the toys for me!

[ Giggling and shrieking, they wrestle over the dildo. ]

MANAGER:
May I please have that back? That is a defective unit and I'm checking it for--

BACHELORETTE:
Defective unit!

[ She holds the shaft of the dildo downward, pointing to the ground. ]

BACHELORETTE:
Saaaaad.

[ Manager grabs it away from her and puts it in the box. ]

MANAGER:
Now, I don't know how or why you ladies got here, but let me see if I can get you a taxi--

BM1:
Dildos!!

[ They shriek. ]

BACHELORETTE:
I'm getting married!!

I have a bachelor's in engineering and a master's in business administration. Don't tell me that my life went wrong!


[STEPH comes out.]

S: How you doing, everybody?

[CURTIS throws some T-shirts into the crowd, hollers.]

S: Yes, I know we’re all having some fun. [Bullshits with the audience, really informally, for a decent minute or so.] So, yeah, few orders of business. Anyhow, let’s get on with the show the way we usually do. It’s time for someone to touch Joel’s face!

[C wheels Joel on. He has been duct-taped to a rolling office chair and is wearing a ballgag. C sets up a chair next to Joel. Joel uses his body to struggle a few inches away. C re-positions him.]

S: So, as you all know, Joel absolutely hates to be touched above his neckline, but – of course – we need to do it to keep the show moving along. Anyhow, could I please have a volunteer from the audience to come touch Joel’s face for us?

[S surveys the crowd.]

S: Please folks, it doesn’t work off the two of us anymore.

C: Trainer says he’s “acclimated.”

[S gets a volunteer from the crowd. I guess we pretty much have to wing it from here, but the following things should happen.

We should outfit audience member with a rubber glove.

C will held “steady the wrist and finger” as we move to initiate the touch.

J should struggle as much as possible until we have to physically hold him in place.

Things to say to the audience member:

“In some cultures, this is supposed to bring good luck and potency/fertility.”

“He’s resisting, but this is supposed to make him more balanced over the long term.”

“You’re going to feel a slightly tingling sensation in your finger … if that starts creeping up your wrist, just come on backstage. We’ve got an herbal handbath already boiling for you.”]

[C wheels a fatigued J offstage.]

S: All right, folks. Thanks, ________. Thanks for the help.

[If anyone else moves to touch the audience member at all (high five, pat on shoulder, etc.), S should scream: “Don’t touch her!!!”]

S: OK. It’s silly time!

ADAM

COURTNEY
Which we thought would be make it easier cuz all the cheap crap at the stores is practically free right now!

ADAM
BUUUUT looks like we kinda missed the boat and--

CURTIS
“We”, Adam?

ADAM
I--looks like I kinda missed the boat and waited too long and now all the stores are out of things.

COURTNEY

CURTIS
Anyway, we *were* able to pick up some stuff for everyone from a guy in the parking lot down at the yellow gas station before the show.

COURTNEY
Everyone can have either….[pulling out one of each] a piece of melty candy or a matchstick.

CURTIS
One per person, one or the other. Not both.

ADAM
We do ask that you sign a waiver before picking up your present though. We have two waivers--one for the candy and one for the matchsticks

CURTIS
Who wants some candy or matches!!!????!!!!!

ADAM
Please come see me before you come tell Curtis or Courtney which one you’d like. There are different waivers for each.

[COURTNEY and CURTIS start speaking on top of Adam, going out into the crowd, ADAM trailing behind with clipboards and pens]

COURTNEY
Free crap for everyone!!

ADAM
It’s really important that you tell me which waiver you want to sign. The verbiage is very different for each one and legally binding.

CURTIS
It’s like Christmas time all over!

ADAM
You may not--I repeat--you may not have either gift without signing the appropriate waiver. This is for you as much as it is for us.

COURTNEY
Free candy! Free free free free free!!!!!

CURTIS
And FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRREEEE!!!!!!!!!

ADAM
If you want us to remain financially solvent as individuals and as an organization, please sign the waiver that indicates that you acknowledge that you “could endure serious gastrointestinal discomfor, possibly resulting in death” if you are choosing the candy, or sign the waiver indicating that you “could be seriously injured or even killed from misuse or mishandling” if you choose the matchstick.

CURTIS
I feel just like Santa Claus! With his big fat belly like a bowlful of jelly! Ho ho ho ho ho!!

ADAM
If you choose the matchstick, we legally cannot provide you with something to strike it against.

[continues on until we or audience get sick of it]

MATING



 [ LIGHTS UP ON A FATHER, SITTING AND DRINKING BEER. His son, TOMMY, ENTERS. ]

Tommy:
Daddy!

Father:
Hey Tommy--

Mother: [interrupts from off stage]
Robert, make sure he's ready for bed! It's nearly nine!

Father: [ sighs ]
You heard your mother. Are you all ready for bed?

Tommy:
Uh, no. I'll go get in pjs in a second. I have to tell you something first.

Father:
All right, tell me and then you hurry up.

Tommy:
Mom... mom is a female, right?

Father:
Yes, Tommy. Your mother is definitely a female. 

[ He takes a long sip of beer. ]

Tommy:
And, Daddy, you're a male, right?

Father:
Yup. I'm a male. And your female mother is going to come yell at both of us if you don't get along to bed.

Tommy:
But Dad this is important! Does Mom know you're a male?

Father:
Yes, Tommy, now--

Mother: [ offstage ]
Robert! Is Tommy still out there? He needs to be in bed!

Father:
All right! I understand! I can understand things the first time! You hear that, you need to get into bed now, buddy.

Tommy:
But Dad you're in danger.

Father:
What are you talking about, Tommy?

Tommy:
From Mommy. I saw on the Discovery TV today on the Superbugs show about "mating" when males and females mate and what happens and when they do that. After it, what happens is the female gets really hungry and she looks all around but the closest food is the male and she eats him! She rips off his head with her teeth very first so the male can't even bite her back or anything. So Dad if Mommy tries to mate with you, you can't do it. You can never mate with Mommy!

Father: [ pauses, takes a sip of beer ]
Yeah, mating. You don't have to worry about Mommy trying to mate with Daddy, son. It's been so long since Mommy and Daddy mated that Mommy and Daddy will probably never mate again.

[ He takes another slow sip of beer. ]

Tommy:
HURRAY!!

[ Tommy dances around. ]

Mommy and daddy never gonna mate! Mommy and daddy never gonna mate! Mommy and daddy never gonna mate!

[ Father sobs. LIGHTS DOWN. ]

[Curtis, Joel, and Steph enter wearing sweaters and khaki shorts.] 
 
Steph: Hey kids, primarily grades 6-8, how ya doin'?
 
Curtis: I CAN'T hear you!
 
Joel: C'mon y'all!  How you REALLY doin'?
 
Steph: You guys are in for a treat because we're gonna have fun while learning about challenges we all face, have faced, or will be facing on a daily basis.
 
Curtis: So put on your learning bandanas.
 
[All tie "learning bandanas" on their heads. Joel pulls out a Bible with a construction-paper smiley face.]
 
Joel: This is our friend, Bobby Bible.
 
Steph: He has a few "good words" to share with you.
 
Curtis: [speaking as the Bible]  It's fun to play with Bobby Bible.
 
[The team plays catch with the Bible.] 
 
Joel: Guys. I don't feel so well. It feels like sin has burrowed into my skin and made a nest.

Curtis: That's called puberty!

Joel: Oh no ... I'm facing various temptations!!!

[Joel runs off stage and puts on the "sin sweater."]

Steph: It's time to pump up the praise!

[She turns on a portable stereo. Dance-y Christian contemporary music plays.

Steph and Curtis begin peeling sins off Joel, thank God.

1. "drugs and alcohol" -- Curtis crumples and throws
2. "toilet language" -- Steph rips it into confetti and throws it into the air
3. "gang violence" -- Curtis cigarette stomps it and wags his finger at it
4. "heavy petting or 'face to crotch'" -- one crumples and tosses, the other hits with the Bible as the bat and runs the bases
5. "carbon dating" -- Curtis violently chokes it against the wall
6. "making gay with your friends" -- Curtis ties it to a chair with duct tape, Steph takes a dump on it, we rip it from the chair, throw it in a bucket, and light it on fire
7. "capital gains tax" -- Curtis slaps it around and fucks it into two pieces, aka "the fuck rip"

Joel is free from sin! Yay!]

JOEL: Now everybody grab a little something from the bowl of sin!

[Curtis comes out with a bowl of sins. Steph comes out with a bowl of candy.]

STEPH: Crush some sin, get some candy!!

[And so it goes.]


Commercials for Behrens Family Unfinished Furniture Warehouse.
Commercial #1:
A man and woman, a married couple are standing in front of their store, the Behrens Family Unfinished Furniture Warehouse. She is dowdy, he is fat. She has crappy country hair and he wears jeans that are too small and those country work boots. You know what I’m talking about. She’s very short, he’s very tall.
Aaron Behrens: So come on down to the Behren’s Family Unfinished Furniture Warehouse. Like the little lady says:
Karen Behrens: We just Want Your Business!
They hold hands and throw wads of money up into the air with their free hands, which is supplemented by someone off screen throwing monopoly money into the shot with the aid of a fan. They hold their hands up together triumphantly.

Commercial #2:
Aaron and Karen stand in front of their store again.
Aaron: and we’ve got this amazing 5 piece pine bedroom set for only $999, but these prices are good this week only so you’d better hurry on down to the Behren’s Family Unfinished Furniture Warehouse where:
Karen: We just want your business!
The do the same thing with the money ad before, but Karen is a bit revolted at the idea of holding her husband’s hand and rips her hand away from his a split second before the cut.
 
Commercial #3:
We see the same store, but now it say Karen Behren’s Unfinished Furniture Warehouse.
Karen is splayed across one of her unfinished beds in a sexy (ish) dress, wearing sunglasses. She has employed a few guys to stand around without their shirts on. None of them should be particularly sexy. Karen seems a little sauced.
Karen: At $899, this pine bedroom set should get your motor running. (someone revs a car off screen) So come on down to Karen Behren’s Unfinished Furniture Warehouse, where I just want your business.
She rolls around on fake money on the bed, which isn’t made but is just a mattress still covered in plastic.
 
Commercial #4
Aaron Behrens is rumpled and gray, looking like he’s lost more than a few pounds. He has bags under his eyes and looks like he was out drinking till about 5 minutes before the shoot. He stands in front of a TINY store that says Aaron Behren’s Unfinished Furniture Warehouse. The store is so small that the name has to be broken up into two lines to fit on the sign.
 
Aaron: This fantastic…..uh….um….bedroom set is just great. For only $8….uh $850…I don’t know….you can take it home today….and put it in your home…..it’s gonna look great….it’s, uh, pine, and, uh, wood….there’s some knobs, metal I think…..At Aaron Behren’s Unfinished Furniture Warehouse….We just want you to come back.

[ Romantic music. ]

M
May I help you?

W
I'd like to see a refrigerator.

M
Here's one now. It's a General Electric. Hello, darling.

W
Harry, I've come to say goodbye.

M
Phyllis, what are you saying?

W
Not now, Harry. Tell me about the refrigerator. I've come with Aunt Fanny and Binky.

M
Well, there's no defrosting.

W
Ah, how tricky!

M
Not even in this roll-out freezer. You see, General Electric has this new system called FrostGuard, so frost never forms. Phyllis....

W
What's ... this?

M
Freeze and store. See, the ice cubes flip right out of their trays.

W
Incessantly?

M
Only when you want them to ... darling ....

W
Oh! Tell me about ... the shelves!

M
The shelves?

W
They ... seem to move.

M
They swing out! All three of them.

W
Would you ... would you swing one out for me? Just once?

M
They also ... move up and down.

W
I rather thought they would.

M
Tall hams fit. You remember how you used to have to cut hams in half? How we laughed at those funny little half-cut hams.

W
We did have fun, didn't we?

M
Phyllis, Phyllis, why?

W
Ah! A freezer. Tell me about it.

M
There's no messy frost.

W
Oh yes ... FrostGuard.

M
Yes, packages won't stick together. Phyllis, why are you doing this to me?

W
Because, Harry, because I must. Because our worlds are separate, Harry. I can't ask you to give up all this to become the son-in-law of a viscount.

M
Refrigerators are my life, Phyllis.

W
I know that, darling. Don't you see? I've always known that.

M
Goodbye, Phyllis.

W
Harry ... would you sell me one of each? And whenever ... whenever a shelf swings out, I'll think of you?

M
And when they move up and down ... I'll think of you.

W
And whenever I see a tall ham ... standing proud and uncut ... [ cries ]

M
I wish I could have given you more, Phyllis. But at least you won't have to defrost ever again. At least I've given you that.

W
Goodbye, Harry! Coming, Aunt Fanny!

M
Goodbye, Phyllis.

FUCK. This sketch is no longer performable in its current form. Why? Because this happened: http://www.hulu.com/watch/42614/saturday-night-live-giraffes

[Guy addressing camera. He is in his room, with a stuffed giraffe and posters of giraffes and a globe turned to face Africa. He is wearing a pith helmet.]

GUY: You want to know why I love giraffes, I'll tell ya! Three reasons.

Reason 1: Fastest! Land! Mammal!

[B&W freeze. Title text: "MYTH!" Switch to photos of giraffes.]

VOICE: The giraffe is much slower than the fastest land mammal.

[Back to guy.]

GUY: Number two, breathes fire! Boom!

[Holds up drawing of a giraffe breathing fire on a medieval village.]

[B&W freeze. Title text: "MYTH!" Switch to photos of giraffes.]

VOICE: The giraffe cannot breathe fire. In fact, giraffes hate fire.

[Back to guy.]

GUY: Reason. Number. Three. Giraffes can learn sign language. Beat that, you dumb zebra!

[Guy pulls out a photo of a zebra, rips it in half.]

[B&W freeze. Title text: "MYTH!" Switch to photos of giraffes.]

VOICE: Giraffes cannot learn or use sign language. Now, let's learn the real facts about giraffes. Giraffes subsist primarily on the leaves of a variety of deciduous trees and shrubs. Giraffes grow to an average height of 17'. That's as tall as two Shaquille O'Neals ...

[Graphic.]

VOICE: ... with room for a Danny DeVito! And their tongues are 18 inches long. That could wrap around your head ... or Danny DeVito's! And let's not forget about those things!

[Picture of giraffe, arrows at horn things.]

VOICE: Those are the real deal too! So, now you know the truth about giraffes. Let's try and keep our facts straight, shall we?

[Cut to guy sulking in his room.]

GUY: Whatever.

VOICE: A message from the International Zoological Council.

GUY: GIRAAAAAAAFFES!!

What now? This sketch is now "Frasier: Myth and Fact"

[ CUT TO a crappy studio, where an OLD MAN and his YOUNG ASSISTANT are sitting in two chairs. Both wear robes. Title card: "SECRETS OF YOUTH AND VIGOR". ]

OLD MAN:
Hello. I thank you for tuning in to "Secrets of Youth and Vigor". I am Guru Chadwick Florence. Today as always I am accompanied by my apprentice, Ben.

[ Assistant stares blankly at the camera. ]

OLD MAN:
I want to discuss today the keys to a lifestyle full of energy and inner light. If you have found yourself increasingly tired of life, if you have felt sorrow and care descend on your soul, or if you simply want to tighten and tone your musculature, you will do well to heed my message.

[ Assistant nods vigorously. ]

OLD MAN:
Stop chasing every exercise trend. Put down your talking electronic diet book. Because you won't find the secret to health and wellness in the latest fad, my friends. You will find it in a tradition of spiritual practice that goes back hundreds of years.

[ Assistant stands and pulls out a small boombox. ]

OLD MAN:
You will find it in the ancient art of jazzercise.

[ Assistant turns on the jukebox, which starts PLAYING CHEEZEBALL 80s MUSIC. Assistant removes robe to reveal a leotard.  ]

OLD MAN:
Jazzercise is not just a method that exercises the body, but a spiritual practice that engages the soul. It hearkens back to our culture's distant past, a time when
 
Folks, you don't have to tell me about your problems. I know the problems. We all have them. We're running out of food, we're running out of water. The savage giant moon crabs, with their enormous claws and love for the taste of human flesh, every day make new incursions into our colony. It seems like most of our friends and family are dead or dying.

JOHNNY PUNCHER
Johnny is at a house party. Music blares and the drunks drink. Johnny chugs a beer and slams down the empty can. Some guy staggers towards Johnny.
 
Some Guy
Man, parties are great, huh?

Johnny
Yeah. They're pretty good.

Some guy
Woo! I mean woo!

Johnny is obviously annoyed and bored.
 
Some guy
Right, buddy?

Some Guy puts his face nose to nose with Johnny's.

Some guy
Woo!

Johnny punches Some Guy square in the nose. Some Guy crumples to the ground. The party stops. Everyone quietly stares.

Johnny
Fuck this shit.

Johnny punches the air and leaves.
 
Johnny walks to his car. He sits in the driver's seat and turns the ignition. The car doesn't start.
 
Johnny
Fuck this shit!

Johnny punches the dashboard and the car starts.
 
Narrator
Yup. There's ol' Johnny Puncher. Fists as big as cantaloupes. The fight in him as big as the sky.
 
Johnny arrives home. Mr. Puncher, wearing boxer shorts , undershirt, and black socks, is waiting in the driveway.

Mr Puncher
Where ya' been Johnny?
 
Johnny
Nowhere!
 
Mr puncher
Your drunk. Again. Your mother and I told you if you come home drunk one more time your out on your ass!

Johnny punches his dad. Mr Puncher crumples to the ground.
 
Narrator
Yup. Ol' Johnny Puncher thought he could punch his way through life. The dark unpleasantness of every day existence would show it's ugly head and Johnny would punch the hell out of it. Johnny, you can't punch all your problems away.

Johnny is punching a tree at the top of a hill.

COURTNEY'S SKETCH ABOUT JOEL



[ LIGHTS UP. Courtney enters holding a script. ]

COURTNEY:
Hi everyone. I just wrote a funny comedy sketch. Want to see it? OK!

[ Begins reading. ]

Well, I'm here. I'm ready to do tonight's show! But where's Joel, I wonder?

[ JOEL ENTERS, head down. ]

Joel! There you are. You look kind of down. What's wrong?

JOEL:
I don't know the line.

COURTNEY:
Well that's quite a surprise! Imagine that!

[ She holds the script in front of his face. ]

JOEL: [ reluctantly ]
I pooped in my diaper.

COURTNEY:
You did what?

JOEL:
I pooped in my diaper because I'm a big baby. And now I'm gonna cry like a big baby, like an even bigger baby than your son who's an actual baby.

COURTNEY:
Joel, don't do that. We're all grown-ups here.

JOEL:
I don't -- you know I don't know these lines.

[ Courtney takes a page of script, crumples it up, throws it at Joel's face. Joel picks it up, uncrumples it, reads. ]

Waaaaah! Waaaaaah! Waaaaaaaaah! This is tooooo hard.

COURTNEY:
Joel, don't make me spank you.

JOEL:
I don't know -- it's on the next page.

[ Courtney rolls up the page, bats Joel on the head with it, then gives it to him. He reads. ]

JOEL:
Thank you for the spanking, Courtney. Your discipline is the only thing that keeps me grounded.

COURTNEY:
Now eat my muffins and tell me how good they are.

JOEL:
OK.

[ She pulls out some muffins, Joel eats one. ]

It's actually really good. Moist.

COURTNEY:
Tell me how big my laptop is.

JOEL:
It's really pretty big!

COURTNEY:
I can't stay mad at you, Joel. Come here and let me PMS on your big fat head.

JOEL'S SKETCH ABOUT COURTNEY



[ LIGHTS UP. JOEL ENTERS. ]

JOEL:
OK, you want a sketch? You want a funny comedy sketch? Here's a funny comedy sketch that I just wrote. Hope you enjoy it! It starts with a little song.

[ Joel sings. ]

Courtney, the big stupid jerk
Always wants me to work
But she doesn't understand
I'm a hard-working man
She don't appreciate my work
What a jerk!
Thaaaaaaaat's Courtney!

[ Joel assumes a ridiculous feminine posture. ]

I'm Courtney, and I think I'm so cool that I can tell Joel what to do, just because I made a baby with my womb and my husband rides a cool motorcycle! Look at me! Look at my cooooooool haircut! Look at my cooooool towels! My laptop's the biggest laptop! WOOOOOOO! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

[ Joel assumes a friendly, innocent posture. ]

Hey, Courtney, I'm really sorry, I had a really lousy week at work, so I'm a little shaky on my lines for that one sketch you wrote.

[ Joel assumes the Courtney posture again. ]

OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A STUPID DUMMY, I'm GONNA HAVE MAD CRAZY ANGRY PMS RIGHT NOW ALL OVER YOUR DUMB HEAD!

[ Joel assumes the Joel posture. ]

Courtney, that's not fair! I've been working hard! Besides, remember that one time that --

[ Joel assumes the Courtney pose. ]

There was never any time that I was ever wrong about anything ever because I have the best towels and the biggest laptop!! So shut your stupid mouth or I'll yell at you again!

[ COURTNEY ENTERS with a plate of mini-muffins. ]

COURTNEY:
Hey Joel, I'm sorry I was being kind of a B before the show, so I snuck out of the theater and baked you a quick plate of mini-muffins.

[ Joel stops, looks nervous. ]

Are you OK, Joely?

JOEL:
I was just -- no I just -- it's OK, I just -- abuh -- ba-ba-ba-ba-baaaaa -- buuuuuh.

COURTNEY:
Joel ...

[ Joel looks ashamed. ]

Joel, come here. I'm going to PMS all over your big stupid head.

[ Joel runs. Courtney chases him. ]

Say my laptop's the biggest! Say it!

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

SKYDIVING INSTRUCTOR
Welcome to skydiving school.

STUDENT 1
It’s good to be here.

STUDENT 2
I’m excited!

INSTRUCTOR
We’re here to talk skydiving. Serious skydiving. By the end of this four-week course, you two will both be certified to perform solo skydives.

STUDENT 1
I can’t wait!

STUDENT 2
It’s a dream.

INSTRUCTOR
So let’s dive right into the course material. Who here can give me a good definition of skydiving?

[ Pause. Student 1 raises hand. ]

INSTRUCTOR
You.

STUDENT 1
Diving, from the sky, with a parachute.

INSTRUCTOR
Good. That’s correct. Now let’s move on to some of the more complicated stuff. What do you do with the cord when you want to deploy your parachute?

STUDENT 2
You pull it.

INSTRUCTOR
Nice. Now we’re getting somewhere. Let’s get to the real meat: What happens when you accidentally land in someone’s back yard?

[ Pause. ]

INSTRUCTOR
Yeah, I didn’t think so. Well, here’s the skinny: When you land in someone’s back yard, that is your new biological family.

[ Pause. ]

INSTRUCTOR
It’s the law. When a skydiver lands in a backyard, he or she legally becomes part of the biological family who resides in that home.

[ STUDENT 1 raises hand. ]

STUDENT 1
What if the family living in the house isn’t a biological family to begin with? You know, what if it’s just some roommates or something?

INSTRUCTOR
Good question. In the eyes of the law, the roommates become a biological family the moment the skydiver’s feet hit the ground in their backyard, with all of the obligations that that implies. And then the skydiver immediately becomes part of that family.

STUDENT 2
Do you get to pick what you are?

INSTRUCTOR
Huh?

STUDENT 2
Like, can you say, “I’m the dad”? Or, “I’m little brother?” What kind of flexibility is a skydiver allowed in this situation?

INSTRUCTOR
Ah, I got it. Good question. The skydiver usually gets treated as a cousin, since that’s the most expedient. It’s a gender neutral designation and it fits OK with different age ranges.

STUDENT 1
Yeah, cousin’s a great category. Lots of flexibility there.

STUDENT 2
I’ve always wanted to be someone’s cousin, and this could be my shot!


INSTRUCTOR
OK, that’s the last thing I had to tell you. Usually it takes four weeks to get through all this stuff! Now go jump out of a plane. 

Instructor shoves them on the ground. “We’re not in the air.” But they have to pantomime it on the floor.

[ Everyone sitting around a table, maybe having drinks. ]

COURTNEY
So did you guys have a good week?

ADAM
Oh yeah, really good.

CURTIS
Not bad. I saw Deadpool. It was kind of stupid.

[ Curtis reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

COURTNEY
Yeah?

CURTIS
Yeah. I don’t see the big deal. He shoots people in the head and makes, like, a “Family Guy” joke. It sucks.

[ Curtis reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

COURTNEY
Too bad.

ADAM
Yeah. Uh … Superhero movies are kind of stupid, to me.

[ Adam reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

CURTIS
Seen any good movies lately, Courtney?

COURTNEY
Yeah. “The Jerk” was on TV. I watched the whole thing again. It’s one of my favorites.

CURTIS
“The Jerk” is really funny.

[ Curtis reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

ADAM
Courtney?

COURTNEY
I said it’s my favorite. It doesn’t count.

ADAM
Huh, I guess not.

CURTIS
Guys, what about the politics?

ADAM
Oh man, American politics?

COURTNEY
Oh boy.

CURTIS
The politics are very very bad. Am I right?

[ Curtis reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

ADAM
Well….

CURTIS
Come on, Adam.

ADAM
I don’t know.

CURTIS
Yes, you do.

ADAM [ sighs ]
They’re … they’re not good, I’ll admit.

[ Adam reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

COURTNEY
I think everyone should treat each other with compassion and respect. Sorry to offend.

[ Courtney reaches into her pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. ]

ADAM
I agree.

CURTIS
It’s not that simple, though.

[ Curtis reaches into his pocket, pulls out a token, and puts it on the table. He pauses. He reaches back into his pocket, roots around desperately. ]

CURTIS
Oh no. Oh no. That was it. That was my last one.

ADAM
You’re kidding me.

COURTNEY
Really?

CURTIS
That was my last opinion. That’s it.

COURTNEY
Oh my god. Really? I still have, like, thousands of these left at home.

ADAM
You’re supposed to use them sparingly.

CURTIS
Now I have to shut up forever.

COURTNEY
Sorry, dude.

Curtis then has to navigate without stated opinions.

Conversation continues, court & adam goad him into participating, he tries to artfully have no opinions but inevitably slips up. Consequences are dire: red lights, siren, helicopter sound, gunshots. Courtney and Adam scatter while Curtis is torn up by a hail of machine gun fire.

DETECTIVES, P.D. #3

[LIGHTS OUT. VOICEOVER ]

VOICEOVER:
Barron and Mac are two tough as wood cops. But then, they got a rookie. His name was Fitz. He was new and didn't know what was going on. They were three cops. Detectives, P.D.

[ DETECTIVES, P.D. THEME MUSIC plays. LIGHTS UP on BARRON and MAC in the car. FITZ walks up with a box of burgers and some softdrinks ]

FITZ:
Anybody want some tasty good burgers? MMMM.

[ FITZ gets into the car. MAC is mad ]

BARRON:
What did I tell you kid, about those buggin' burgers!?

FITZ:
I was hungry. Didn't wanna have dumb stew again! I don't want it!

MAC:
Burgers are no crappin' good for you!

[ MAC throws the burgers out the window. FITZ and BARRON are shocked ]

BARRON:
What did I tell you, kid? Just cool it off with the burgers, okay?

FITZ: [ perking up ]
I see him now, Barron! He's flying but his wings ain't free.

[ They pile out. BLACKOUT. LIGHTS UP on BARRON and FITZ with their guns drawn, walking through some place ]

BARRON:
I think I saw the perd this way.

FITZ:
I'm gonna do this carmichael good. Real good.

BARRON:
You do him, FITZ, you do him.

[ BARRON suddenly knocks FITZ down and holds him down by the scarf he gave him. MAC comes out and shoots FITZ in the tummy. He yells "BANG BANG" when he does it. MAC leaves. ]

BARRON: [ crying and holding FITZ's dying head up ]
I told you to be coolio about the burgers. Why couldn't you? Why couldn't you just find the line? You just had to go and be a crimshaw, you stupid baby! Aw, FITZ, aw no, I'm so sad.

FITZ:
Barron, it's okay. I'm dying now.

[ FITZ dies and BARRON cries over him like a baby. LIGHTS DOWN ]


[ A MAN and WOMAN are frozen in place in statuesque positions. Their feet are in cement blocks. ]

MAN
It's raining again.

[ They scream over each other .]

WOMAN
I COULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW!
I'D BE DOING A LOT OF PEOPLE A FAVOR!
IT'S WHAT I THINK ABOUT AT NIGHT!

MAN
OH, YOU ARE ALL TALK!
YOU DON'T HAVE THE GUTS!
DREAM ON, BABY




Thank you captain obvious.

I'm just saying is all.

That's the problem with the whole concept of you.

That's pretty harsh.

All You do is say. Never any action. Constantly stagnant.

What do you want from me?

An apology.

Ok. I'm sorry.

You don't even know what you're apologizing for, do you?

Nope.

And there it is.

There what is?

Forget it.

Look. I'm sorry I volunteered us for the city's Living Statues in the park exhibit.

And

I'm sorry I didn't read the fine print.

AND

And that by signing the contract with the city our feet would be sealed in cement blocks.

I'm sorry we technically agreed to do this for six days straight.

AND!

I'm sorry I ate your cup of noodle at work.

Thank you.

You're welcome.

I feel better.




Make apologies worse and worse and worse.

Joel sits on stage waiting.  He begins twiddling his thumbs. Steph walks on stage as if stepping out of a fitting room.  Joel does not notice her.

Steph: Ahem.

Joel: That one looks great!

Steph: You like it?  (she spins)

Joel: Yeah, it looks nothing like the first eight dresses. I think this is the one.

Steph: Do you think your parents will like it?

Joel: Sure, yeah.

Steph: I just don't know if it's a good 'first impression' dress.

(Curtis glides on stage wearing a tight black outfit, looks at Joel, looks at Steph, and scoffs.  Steph is unaware of his presence.  Joel greets him like he's always been there.  He leans close to Joel.)

Curtis: The fuck is she talking about?

Joel: We're meeting my parents tomorrow night.

Curtis: Let me guess.  Apple bee's.  Right?

Steph:  And it might be a little too much for Apple bee's.

Curtis: Oh God.  Is she always this boring.

Steph:  But it is your favorite color.

Curtis: That dress is blue.

Joel: Yeah?

Curtis: Is blue your favorite color?

Joel: Yes.

Curtis: Well how the hell does she know that?

Joel: I must have told her.  Maybe in conversation it just came out.

Steph:  And I don't have any blue dresses.

Curtis: Joel, do you remember specifically telling her that blue is your favorite color?

Joel: No, I can't pin down one moment...

Curtis: She's reading your mind.

Steph:  I have black dresses and brown dresses but you said black is sinful and brown makes you think of diarrhea.

Joel: I never told her that.

Curtis: Is it true?

Joel: (look scared) Uh-huh.

Curtis: This isn't good.  This is NOT good. 

Joel: Let me try something.  Hey, babe.  You know what I'm thinking?

Steph:  That you're bored and I should hurry up and pick one?

Joel: Dear God.

Curtis: She's deep in your skull. 

Joel: What should I do?


GIANT FOREHEAD, HEART OF STONE



[ LIGHTS UP on a GUY. ]

GUY:
I'll paint the scene for you. 1:40 AM, a night on the town, alone. It's one of those days you keep giving another chance, even though it hasn't earned it. I'm halfway into a glass of straight whiskey and I'm picking up the pace so I can order one more before last call. And then ... this woman.

[ SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN APPEARS. (You can do this at the back part of the stage at the Hideout ... draw the curtains closed, and have the tech person put on the back light.) She poses as the guy delivers his monologue. ]

You know the type. Giant forehead, heart of stone. The kind of woman who'll make you do her laundry but won't give you the last stick of gum. Thighs up to here.

[ He indicates his neck. ]

Shoulders down to here.

[ He indicates midway down his torso. ]

And elbows somewhere over there.

[ He points some distance away. ]

Might as well be in another county. Two good legs with feet right at the end, but they ain't for walking, you know? Unless it's walking all over you.

The most transparent skin you've ever seen. You could watch the heart beating right in this broad's chest and see the blood rushing to every organ, like poor slobs off to work in their little red cars. You get to work, little blood cells. Get all the way up those thighs and down those shoulders.

There's frogs and fish with skin like that. Then there was this dame, who had them all beat.

She was bad news; I could smell it on her. Bad news in new shoes. Giant foreheard, heart of stone -- just like mama taught me.

WOMAN: [ continues facing back ]
Aren't you coming to bed? My forehead's getting cold.

GUY:
Believe me, if you saw this forehead, you wouldn't blame me.

[ LIGHTS OUT. ]


(GUY WALKS TO HIS CAR CARRYING BAGS OF GROCERIES)
BUM: Sir?! I’m glad I caught you.
GUY: Oh did I forget something?
BUM: No. A dollar please.
GUY: Sorry, but no.
BUM: You owe me a dollar.
GUY: I already paid for these.
BUM: No. Your windows. I washed your windows.
GUY: I didn’t see you wash anything.
BUM: I did. I swear. I don’t lie. I wouldn’t lie. Not about windows. Dollar.
GUY: No.
BUM: I worked really hard on those. Dollar.
GUY: I’m sorry, but I didn’t ask you to. Besides, you could be lying about this. There could be some rogue window washer leaping from parking lot to parking lot washing citizens’ car windows, and you’re taking credit for it.
(WOMAN approaches)
WOMAN: Hey Jasper! Great job on the windows (WOMAN hands BUM a dollar. WOMAN exits).
GUY: That doesn’t prove anything.
BUM: It’s just a dollar.
GUY: I’m sorry, but I don’t have time to discuss whether or not you washed my windows and whether or not you deserve a dollar. I have ice cream.
BUM: Oooh. What kind?
GUY: Chocolate chip.
BUM: I love chocolate chip!
GUY: Me too. Sometimes I’ll just sit down in front of the TV and just stuff my face. The next day I feel so fat, but it’s worth it.
BUM: Can I have my dollar now?
GUY: NO.
BUM: How about some ice cream, then?
GUY: Absolutely not.
BUM: C’mon friend.
GUY: I’m not your friend.
BUM: But we just shared a moment. C’mon.
GUY: We didn’t
BUM: Yu huh. I was like “What kind of ice cream did you get?” and you were like “this kind” and I was all “I love that kind” and then we both went “Yay!”
GUY: Who says Yay? I’ve never said yay.
BUM: It’s only a dollar.
GUY: Which you don’t deserve. Now take your get rich quick scheme and get lost you SMELLY LAZY BUM.
(BUM is incredibly hurt)
GUY: Okay fine. Here’s a dollar. (He reaches into his pocket and holds out a dollar.)
BUM: I don’t want it.
GUY: Please? I’m sorry. Hey, look at my reflection in that window. This can’t possibly be my car, the windows are too clean.
BUM: You like it?
GUY: You did a great job.

Hey. Hey. Could I use your hotspot? ... Hey, you know any hotspots? ... Do you have a hotspot? ... Can I use your hotspot? I just need to update my Twitter, man. ... Hey, man. Yeah, I'm talking to you. Is this your hotspot? Man, don't act like you don't know. I just refreshed my network list, man. Come on, just give me your network key for a minute, man. You don't have to tell me. I'll give you the laptop and you can punch it in. Man, I just gotta update my Twitter. ... No, I know what you mean. No, man, I understand. Yeah, I get tired of that social networking junk too, man. I hate it when people are like "I just woke up, I'm at home, I'm eating a McMuffin, I just rented Failure to Launch." Who cares, right? No, I use it to update people about stuff I'm working on ... sometimes I share an article from BoingBoing or something. Come on, man, I got like 700 unread items on my RSS feed. Maybe 800. It's piling up, man, just let me use your hotspot. How about it, man? You gonna let me use your hotspot? ... Let me use your hotspot. Come on, man. Come on. Where you going??

PET EXPERT



[ CENTER SPOTLIGHT UP. CURTIS LEAPS INTO IT. ]

CURTIS:
Problems with your puppy? Kitten giving you conniptions? Well, you called the right man, folks, because I am a pet expert!

JOEL: [ v/o ]
A lonely night. And a lonely man passes a lonely hour in his room.

CURTIS:
What's that, ma'am? Parrot's gone quiet on you? Well, maybe I can get him squawkin' again. Who, me? Just a pet expert, that's all.

JOEL: [ v/o ]
But his lonely heart is full.

CURTIS:
An unusual pet, you say? Try me, I've seen them all. A ferret? Please.

JOEL: [ v/o ]
Full of candydrop dreams and butterfly wishes.

CURTIS:
Why, that's a lovely pony, officer. You mind if I stroke his mane? Do I know the proper technique? Well, let me show you my badge. Boom! Pet expert!

JOEL: [ v/o ]
His name is Curtis Luciani. In his mind, fairy clouds and angel feathers dance their roundelay.

CURTIS:
Ladies and gentlemen, back away from that angry-looking pit bull. Rabies? I don't think so. I think this guy just needs someone to be his friend. Says who? Says a pet expert!

JOEL: [ v/o ]
His is a world of wonder and hope. A world where magic still holds the darkness at bay.

[ Curtis pets and strokes the empty air as LIGHTS FADE OUT. ]

JOEL: [ v/o ]

[ LIGHTS UP. Chester is sitting in a chair, looking at his reflection in a full-length mirror. He has a stuffed dog in his lap. ]

CHESTER
I couldn’t help but notice what a wonderful art collection you have, Mr. Dale.

Thanks, Mr. Dale.

Did it take you a long time to acquire so much beautiful art, Mr. Dale?

It did, Mr. Dale. If you want to buy art you have to meet with a lot of very interesting people, and they tell you which art is the best, and then you have to buy it.

That sounds complicated, Mr. Dale.

It is, Mr. Dale!

And then I suppose you have to find a way to move it.

Yes. And you can’t just wrap it in a blanket or some newspaper, Mr. Dale.

You can’t, Mr. Dale?

No. You have to get some men with a truck. A big truck, Mr. Dale. And those men better be wearing gloves, because if they’re not, well you can just forget it. Forget about the whole thing.

What an ordeal, Mr. Dale!

That’s right, Mr. Dale.

But mother must be so pleased with you, Mr. Dale! Look at all your fine Modiglianis.

Believe me, Mr. Dale, I don’t need to look. I see them plenty.

That’s funny, Mr. Dale.

Thank you, Mr. Dale.


[ Someone enters dressed as a gorilla. ]

COURTNEY
Look everyone, it’s CoCo the sketch gorilla!

CURTIS
This is our friend CoCo and she is an orphaned sketch gorilla. We found her in the jungle, abandoned and alone because we shot her mother!

COURTNEY
Hunting big game is so amazing. I love being a wildlife enthusiast.

[ COCO signs wildly and hands them a script ]

CURTIS
CoCo has written us a new script!

[ CURTIS and COURTNEY read over the script ]

COURTNEY
CoCo, we agreed no more kitten sketches.

[ CoCo signs wildly ]

CURTIS
During our last writing session, remember? You had a kitten monologue and two kitten sketches and we said “no more kitten sketches, CoCo.”

[ CoCo signs ]

COURTNEY
She says “CoCo write what CoCo know.”

CURTIS
Also, we had to cut the kitten monologue. Sorry, CoCo.

[ CoCo starts to lose it. Signs to COURTNEY and CURTIS ]

CURTIS [ laughs ]
She says “CoCo off-book already”.

COURTNEY [ laughs ]
She says “you guys are never fully off-book for shows”. CoCo, that’s because we don’t have to be! We’re naturally charming.

[ CoCo signs ]

CURTIS
She says “CoCo hate sketchprov. It’s the worst of both worlds. You lose the spontaneity of improv and you also lose the precision of a well-rehearsed show.”

COURTNEY
Come on, CoCo, don’t be mean.

[ CoCo signs ]

CURTIS
She’s saying we’re unprofessional and lazy.

[ CoCo starts freaking out ]

COURTNEY
She’s saying “CoCo have button! CoCo have button! You two never end sketches! You just segue into the next sketch! Lazy!”

CURTIS
CoCo wants a button?

COURTNEY
I think she wants a button.

CURTIS
I have a nice shiny RED button right here! CoCo!!!

[ CoCo runs over and grabs the button and runs off ]

COURTNEY
Stupid fucking gorilla.

JOEL'S BODY ISSUES



JOEL:
Hi, everyone. My name's Joel Osborne, of Your Terrific Neighbors. We've been having lots of fun tonight, but I'd like to take a moment to address a serious issue, if I could.

[ Beat. ]

I appreciate a full-figured woman. Oh, sure Joel, who doesn't? That's what I imagine you are saying to yourselves right now. Well, it's a tragic truth, my friends, that millions of women of all ages throughout this country with huge awesome tits and delicious fat asses suffer from severe body image issues. When they look in the mirror, they don't see a girl from a magazine cover. And it hurts.

[ Beat. ]

That's why I started the Joel Osborne Foundation For Insanely Hot Chicks. Our mission is right there in our name. The Joel Osborne Foundation For Insanely Hot Chicks is dedicated to finding beautiful full-figured young ladies with self-confidence issues and providing them a safe place where they can talk about their problems with me, Joel Osborne. My personal guarantee is that I will sex confidence into each one of these girls, no matter how long it takes, no matter what the cost.

[ An audience member stands up. ]

AM:
You're having sex with these women??

JOEL:
I never said that.

AM:
You just said you were!

JOEL:
Oh. Well, I suppose it makes sense that I would say that, because it is technically true.

AM:
You're a monster!

JOEL:
I believe in a direct healing methodology.

Delay the sex reveal.

  [SHOT of the inside of the car. Held throughout the rest of the piece.

  ROB is driving the car, KARA is in the passenger seat. The radio plays in the background. JUSTIN sits in the backseat. Rob jiggles the steering wheel as though to suggest he is driving. BUT IN REALITY ROB, or Joel, IS NOT DRIVING.]

  Rob: Hey bro, where's Mindy?

  Justin: Okay, she broke up with me.

  BAD COMEDIAN



[ LIGHTS UP. CURTIS AND STEPH ARE SITTING ON STAGE, looking upstage.

COMIC ENTERS. He is incredibly nervous. His clothes resemble those of a Vaudeville comedian. He is wearing a large blue and white polka dotted bow-tie. He takes center stage. ]

COMIC
Ladies and gentlemen, I am a comedian.

[ He clears his throat. ]

My wife is such a slut. I mean, I had a wife who-- What I mean to say is, I can't get a good night's sleep because my slut wife likes to talk after sex. You try to sleep with the phone ringing all night.

[ Silence. After the punchline the large bow tie begins to spin. It is so big that it hits him in the face and is unable to spin. He awkwardly reacts. ]

My friend Eddie is grotesquely obese. He was at my home yesterday and I said, "Eddie, you're so fat the great state of Montana doesn't have the land mass or food available to sustain you."

[ Silence. After the punchline the large bow tie begins to spin. It is so big that it hits him in the face and is unable to spin. He awkwardly reacts. ]

I need a third joke to say here.

[ He extends his arms. Hopefully there will be silence. The large bow tie begins to spin. It is so big that it hits him in the face and is unable to spin. He awkwardly reacts. ]

So, did I get the gig?

[ Pause. ]

CURTIS
Yes.

STEPH:
Yes, you did.

COMIC
Yay.

[ LIGHTS DOWN. ]

(Lights up on a very excited HEB PATRON holding a baby. He mouths every curse word silently.)

HEB PATRON: Y’all been to that new HEB? God damn! That new HEB be blowin’ up, son! I read about it on the Austinist. Had a selection of artisinal cheeses and local deli meats, y’all, I am not even playin’. Deep-ass discounts on seasonal merch like foldin’ chairs, coolers, and summer plasticware. They gave me this reusable bag? I fit like 1,000 iTunes gift cards in that shit. I mean I am talkin’ FRESH BREADS. They was throwin’ free samples around and shit. I accidentally swallowed an olive that was grown in motherfuckin’ FREDERICKSBURG. I bought too much stuff -- had to buy a second bike to get my shit home. There was an impromptu jam sesh that broke out NEXT TO THE JAMS AND PRESERVES AND MAGAZINES. Somebody high-fived me, and in my hand was a coupon for a free mandolin with the purchase of two bottles of barbecue sauce! They could not screen print those HEB Kindle Fire HD cases fast enough, y’all -- and I am not playin’. The pharmacy was givin’ out free AR codes to HEB Tumblrs with any prescription medication refill! I asked that HEB pharmacist, “Are you kidding me?” Dude was all like, “No, I am not kidding!” They had salsa bowls in the shape of Travis County! There was a Febreeze that smelled like Willie Nelson on the first day of spring! There was this Barton Springs Bottled Hippy Water. It tasted exactly like it sounds, which was disgusting, y’all. There was this one microbrew that made a reference to Sixth Street -- you know, that street in Austin with the bars! They had trails of bluebonnet petals leading to the motherfucking BATHROOMS. I clogged the toilet, and an airhorn sounded and all HEB staff stopped and yelled, “SPECIAL SESSION!”

(Pause.)

HEB PATRON: Damn, now that I say it out-loud style, that may have all been a beautiful-ass dream I had. Y’all been to that new HEB in my dream?

(Lights down.)

[ GERRY and GARY are working at opposite sides of the stage. Each has a desk phone. GARY is working frantically, but GERRY moves slowly and has an air of tremendous self-satisfaction--as well as a foil-wrapped toothpick in her mouth. Gary picks up the phone and quickly dials a number. ]

GARY: Is this Mr. Len Richards? Mr. Richards? Yes, am I speaking with Mr. Len Richards? I am? I am. That’s good. I’m calling to see if we can interest you in new friendships with other divorced fathers in your area. Nothing too intimate, just an opportunity to bond over mutual interests … flight simulators, the World Series of Poker. Just download our app, DadFriendr, and you can start to--Hello? Hello? Damn.

[ He hangs up. ]

GARY: I lost another one.

GERRY: It’s a funny way of doing business.

GARY: I’m screwed this week. The new quotas are impossible.

GERRY: Life’s impossible, man.

GARY: I don’t understand how you have this detached attitude about it.

GERRY: I have my secrets and my ways, man. Notice anything?

[ She draws attention to her toothpick. ]

GARY: Toothpick?

GERRY: What about it?

GARY: You’ve got something in your teeth.

GERRY: Take a closer look, baby.

GARY: At your teeth?

[ She taps the foil-wrapped end of the toothpick. ]

GARY: That’s from a sandwich?

GERRY: I ain’t trying to brag, but … hell yeah.

GARY: Lunch?

GERRY: [ cocky ] Yeah, I went to lunch.

GARY: Good for you.

GERRY: Good for me, good for you. Lunch is good for everybody. A little meal in the middle of the day. Or maybe not so little. Maybe you want to fill up and have a light dinner instead. You can do that. I can, anyway.

GARY: Anyone can eat lunch, Gerry.

GERRY: Keep dreaming, sweet pants.

GARY: I had lunch, Gerry.

GERRY: What’d you have for lunch, Gary?

GARY: A handful of nuts.

Nerd1: Trumpets, form up!

[Three trumpet players line up. When they lift their trumpets we see giant spit wads in the ends.]

Nerd1: Fire!

[The spitwads knock Mike off his feet. Violinists approach and start smacking him in the face with their bows. More instrument fighting ensues.]

[ COURTNEY and BRADEN onstage. Braden is dressed business casual, standing, with a laptop bag. Courtney is seated, working on a book of puzzles. They look as though they are waiting for a bus. ]



CURTIS [ charging onstage from the audience ]
Give me back my fucking belt!

BRADEN
Whoa, whoa!

[ Curtis starts grabbing for Braden’s belt. Courtney tackles him. ]

CURTIS
That’s my belt! You took my fucking belt!

COURTNEY
Sir! Stop it! Sir!

[ Braden tries to hide behind part of the set, while Curtis tries to pursue him and Courtney holds him back. ]

CURTIS
It’s my belt! My belt! You can’t just take someone’s belt away and make it yours!

BRADEN
Sir, please, sir, you’re a real member of the audience—

COURTNEY

TITLE OF SKETCH (Lastname)

CHOPPED AND SCREWED



[ Braden and Courtney onstage. Braden is wearing an apron, standing behind a table. Courtney is waiting in line. Curtis enters, speaks to audience. ]

CURTIS
Folks, a few of you may remember our sketch “Barista Is a Butthole”. Probably not many of you. Wasn’t very popular. However, there is a chopped and screwed version of the sketch by DJ 13 PM that’s currently getting a lot of play in Houston clubs. 13 PM’s version really brings out elements of the sketch that, I think you’ll agree, didn’t play so well in the original version.

[ Curtis exits. ]

[ SOUND: Syrupy, slow hip-hop beat. ]

COURTNEY [ low, slow voice ]
I’d like a coffee I’d I’d like a coffee.

BRADEN [ low, slow voice ]
I’m a bad barista I’m a I’m a bad barista.

COURTNEY
I’d like a coffee I’d I’d like a coffee.

BRADEN
No way. No way. No way. No way.

[ Curtis enters. ]

CURTIS [ low, slow voice ]
I’m the manager, yeah, I’m the manager.

COURTNEY
He won’t give me coffee, shit, coffee motherfucker shit.

BRADEN
I never get that coffee ‘cause I’m a bad barista, what.

CURTIS
I’m a bad manager. I’m a bad manager. Instead of being helpful, I’ll say some nasty shit to you.

COURTNEY [ as long as she can hold it ]
Uuuuuuuuuuuuughhhhh.

CURTIS
You just got bad seeeeervice.

BRADEN
That’s a fundamental sketch comedy experience.

COURTNEY [ as long as she can hold it ]
Uuuuuuuuuuuuughhhhh.

[ Lights out. ]


FEUDAL TICKLE FIGHT

Feudal times.

Towncryer: Hear Ye, hear Ye, the court will now hear Miller's petition against Baker.

Judge: Miller, what is your complaint against Baker?

Miller: I bought eight loaves of bread from Baker last Tuesday after midday, just like I do every Tuesday after midday. But when as my little son, Hempford, was eating one of the loaves on Thursday, he bit into something hard. When he spit out the something, he found it to be a tooth! We checked 'is mouth top and bottom, but all of his teeth are there. Thus, I complain that Baker put a tooth in my bread.

Judge: Was this the only tooth you found?

Miller: It were.

Judge: Baker, what say you?

Baker: Tweren't no toof! Why would I put a toof in me bread?

Miller: You owe me my money back for those loaves!

Baker: I can't spare ya none! And besides, you got them loaves for half and owe ME moneys.

Judge: Order, order! Since Baker has no money for the court to order him to give Miller, and Miller owes Baker money but also does not have it, the complaint must be settled some other way. Townspeople, what say you?

Townsperson 1: Rooster race!

Townsperson 2: Tickle fight!

Townspeople: Tickle fight!  Tickle fight!  Tickle fight!  Tickle fight!  Tickle fight!  Tickle fight!  Tickle fight!

[Tickle fight ensues. Judge laughs a merry, Santa-type laugh. Baker decisively wins the tickle fight.]

Woman screams and runs out the door. Man goes to the door

Man: (yelling) It's okay, I'm here. I'll always be here.

Man is sad. Then he is behind himself.

Man behind the man: It's okay, I'm here. I'll always be here.

Man gives Man some jewelry and Man and Man make out.

TONY SEES THE DUSTPAN



[ LIGHTS UP ON A NARRATOR, a wise guy. ]

NARRATOR:
So three weeks had gone by since the airport job, and Tony and I were flying high. We had more money in our pockets than ever before, and we were finally starting to get some of the respect that we felt entitled to. Life, in short, was good. I bought three new suits. One of them I didn't like so much when I tried it out at home, so I returned it, and I got two new suits in its place. New total: four suits. Life, in short, was pretty damn good. Then we got the call from Primo Muntaglia. It was time for Tony to see the dustpan.

[ MORE LIGHTS UP, REVEALING TONY AND PRIMO ENTERING. ]

TONY:
So, I've been hearing things about this dustpan.

PRIMO:
Sure thing, Tony.

TONY:
Lotta good things.

PRIMO:
Sure thing, Tony.

NARRATOR:
You see, I wasn't full-blood Italian myself, not like Tony. So I knew I was never gonna see this dustpan myself. Tony was the one who was gonna see it. And knowing he was gonna see it ... it was like I was gettin' a chance to see it myself.

TONY:


Two people grocery shopping

1: (reading a label on a can) Glut-ton-y

2: What?

1: One of the ingredients in this can of beans: Gluttony

2: That's probably just glucose. You're reading it wrong

1: No, it says Gluttony.

2: Lemme see. (looks) Hm....Gluttony.

1: (reading a label on a box) Lust

2: Are you kidding?

1: no, it says Lust.

(2 takes the box and looks at it)

2: It says Lust

1: This cake mix has Pride in it.

2: What the hell?

1: These dried apricots have Greed in them.

2: What's going on? Have these things always been in our food?

1: I don't know, do you think, like, the FDA knows about this?

2: I know they approved irradiation but I'm pretty sure putting deadly sins in our food is illegal.

1: It should at least say it on the box. Like "Contains deadly sins" like where they list the allergens.

2: It does! "This product contains wheat, nuts and despair."

1: Well, are there any non-deadly sin options? Like, if somethings organic does that mean it does or doesn't include deadly sins.

"StuffzyBears"

[Four people sit around a table in a fancy room plus a lawyer at the head of the table.]

Lawyer: Now, as your father equally divided his estate and investments among you, he has also given each of you one forth ownership in the company, StuffzyBears. The company was in the midst of a transition b/c of the decline in demand for StuffzyBears. Money for the transition has been sit aside. So basically, you four have a lot of stuffing and only have to decide what to stuff before the company can become productive. That concludes the reading of the will. Now, your father made his fortunes and your's off StuffzyBears, so I advise you to consider carefully what kind of stuffing you next venture into. We'll talk next week.

1: Wow, okay. No one has really been here working with the company, but I guess it's up to us to decide what we... stuff now.

2: Yes, and the sooner the better.

3: My first thought was teddy bears, but I guess Dad had a reason for giving up on StuffzyBears.

2: No shit.

3: Ugh, chill out, Martin.

4: He does have a point. We need to go in a totally new direction. [picks up a pile of stuffing and rubs it between his fingers] We could stuff

[ LIGHTS UP. A DUDE is sitting onstage. He is wearing a camo vest and cap. He is drinking a cheap canned beer and reading The Economist. Suddenly, he gets frustrated and throws it to the ground. ]

DUDE
Goddam magazine!

GODDAM MAGAZINE PT. 2



[ LIGHTS UP. The dude is sitting onstage by a table. He is pouring a glass of wine. He smells it, observes it. Then he takes a sip. Immediately, he spits it back in the glass. ]

Cheap, shitty, goddam beaujolais!

HOST
How many hours a day do you, as an adult, spend thinking about your favorite color? Too many, I bet. While it’s perfectly appropriate for a child or even an adolescent to profess and fixate on a single color to the exclusion of others, it may seem embarrassing and alienating for an adult to obsess in the same manner.

[ An ADULT WOMAN enters. She is wearing something green, but not particularly obvious or noticeable. ]

ADULT WOMAN
My name is Cherly. I’m an adult woman, fully of age by both legal and cultural standards, and as you can probably guess, my favorite color is …

[ She points awkwardly at the green part of her outfit. ]

ADULT WOMAN
… green. But I’m afraid that my mad infantile enthusiasm for this additive primary color is stunting my ability to flourish as a mature female citizen of a energetic market society. And I’m starting to worry that I’ll die without having fully lived.

HOST
Well, you said it, not me. It’s important for functioning adults, as part of their psychological and aesthetic development, to develop an equanimous relationship to the colors.

ADULT WOMAN
Save me from this hell I’m in.

HOST
It’s as simple as this: see a color, say a color.

ADULT WOMAN
See a color, say a color.

HOST
When you become aware of the perception of a color forming in your visual cortex, say the name of that color as quickly and as

Being a parent in today’s world isn’t easy. Whether I’m getting them out the door in the morning or back to bed at night, it seems like there’s always something I’m forgetting. Making meals, washing clothes, helping with homework.
And then I still have like twenty characters to unlock!

Did you know that children who haven’t unlocked all the available characters in every game they own, in controlled experiments, show a below average ability to reason, understand abstract concepts, and synthesize information to come to conclusions? That’s probably why these same children go on to perform poorly on state-mandated standardized tests.

Unlocking new characters isn’t just about a new way to play. It’s a way to set your child’s imagination on wild new adventures as they’re inspired by the new character’s unique costume and special moves.

I believe that playing with a full set of unlocked characters is a right that every child should have, and now, with Gamepros, every child can enjoy that right, as long as their parents pay for it, which, as far as I know, is how rights work.

Gamepros’ specially trained teams of gaming pros are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to complete your child’s game on whatever difficulty setting is necessary to unlock additional characters, costumes, and items. From now on, unlocking characters doesn’t have to become one more big hassle for a parent on the go.


UNDERSTANDING STIMULI



[ LIGHTS UP on an amiable host, sitting in a chair facing the audience. He is holding a book. ]

HOST
Introduction to Psychology: course one, lesson three. Understanding stimuli.

[ Beat. ]

Stimuli. What are they? Well, if it goes in through the body and ends up in the brain, chances are, it's a stimulus. Stimuli come in a variety of forms, whether it's a sharp blow to the head or a great 19th-century Russian novel, like War and Peace.

[ He tosses the book over his shoulder, offstage. ]

OFFSTAGE VOICE
Ouch! This book just creamed me in the head!

HOST
Then you, sir, have been stimulated.

OFFSTAGE
Now I'm reading and enjoying it!

[ Host shrugs toward the audience. ]

HOST
Stimuli are considered to be


SONGWRITERS



[ LIGHTS UP ON A PAIR OF SONGWRITERS. They are sitting down, both with a pad of paper and a pen. Numerous crumbled wads of paper around them.

Long pause. 1 starts writing, speaks as he writes. ]

1
Lady, you're the best -- the best -- uhhh ...

2
Ooh. Better than all the rest.

1
Come on.

2
You're right. You're right. I wasn't trying.

1
You're the best ... um, you were the best. You were the best ...

2
Part?

1
You were the best part. You were the best part ... of being me?

2
That works. Maybe a country vibe?

1 [ sings ]
You were the best part of being me ... deederdeer.

2
No. No, no, no. No no no no. No no no.

1
Yes!

2
No.

1
Maybe?

2
No.

1
You're right.

[ Rips, crumples, throws. ]


[ LIGHTS UP. FEDORA is sitting at home. A knock at the door. Fedora man goes to open the door. It is PIZZA GIRL. ]

PIZZA GIRL
Large artichoke and black olive?

FEDORA
Yeah. I have coupon.

[ FEDORA hands PIZZA GIRL a COUPON ]

PIZZA GIRL
Hmm, you should tell them this when you call so they can get the bill straight. No biggie, though, lemme call it in.

[ PIZZA GIRL takes out her PHONE and makes a call, handing the PIZZA to FEDORA. He waits patiently. INDIANA JONES enters, pushing PIZZA GIRL into FEDORA causing him to toss the PIZZA into the air. INDIANA JONES catches it. ]

INDIANA JONES
This pizza belongs in a museum!

[ INDIANA JONES exits. LIGHTS DOWN ]


[ MAN runs onstage. ]

MAN
You folks gotta help me! Sorry, I know there’s a show going on up here or something … I’m sorry. But this is a god dang friggin’ emergency! I can’t go to the police or the government, because they’ll never believe me. But I need help. My name is Macklemore. No, no, no, no! Not that guy … I’m the real Macklemore. This guy … this impostor, with the corny backpack rap songs … That’s not me! That guy took my life, my took my name, and then quite to my surprise he turned it into a career in corny backpack rap! That’s not me, folks. I’m an attorney. I work with patent stuff, mostly. Smaller cases, a lot of mediations and arbitrations. I haven’t seen the inside of a courtroom, per se, in 15 years. That surprises people, but most people only know of the law what they see on TV. Really, your average attorney is in a conference room more than he … or she ... is in a courtroom. That’s not the point. The point is, what shot does a regular white-collar son of a guy like me wrangling his life back from the merciless Macklemore? No shot at all, I reckon. So maybe it’s time to start building and new life and a new identity from scratch. My name is Tyson Chicken, and I am a newborn baby.

STRIP CLUB



[ MUSIC: STRIP CLUB SONGS. LIGHTS UP ON TWO GUYS SITTING AT A TABLE, drinking beers. ]

ANNOUNCER:
All right, fellas: hope you've still got some party left in you, because we've got girls for you all night long. Turn your eyes to the main stage, because bad girl Harmony is looking to start some trouble.

[ MUSIC. The guys stare offstage. ]

GUY 1:
That is something.

GUY 2:
That is something hot.

GUY 1:
The way that that stripper takes off her clothes.

GUY 2:
I know what you mean, pal.

GUY 1:
All her clothes.

GUY 2:
Almost all.

[ They clink their beers, continue staring. ]\


Everyone at a fancy dinner party is about to eat when they realize they are one napkin short. The last guest says, "Oh, that's all right. I can skip one napkin." But he/she never recovers (never gets clean) ... becomes a slob, loses job, gets shunned by society. Becomes an untouchable (maybe encounters a secret society of people living on the fringes who stopped using napkins and don't know how to do anything?)
Scene of the person staring through a window at a family eating dinner. They wipe their mouths and the napkin less person mimes wiping his/her mouth. The family gets into a playful napkin fight while the unseen untouchable silently cries.
Person turns to leave. Child comes outside and silently offers her napkin. Vagrant reaches for it but parent grabs child's arm away. "No!" Then to vagrant, "She's just a child!"

JANITORS



[ Three janitors are cleaning up onstage. One steps forward. ]

JANITOR
It’s a dirty job, cleaning up other people’s trash. But I don’t let it get me down. People sez to me, you’re a janitor? Yeah, that’s right. Don’t it get you down, dealing with messes all day? Not me. Ya see, ya gotta learn to see the beauty in everything, even in a pile of garbage. And you know something? When there ain’t enough beauty around, I make a little myself.

[ A really bad stomp-esque routine occurs. The end! ]

[ LIGHTS UP on JOEL and CURTIS laughing. ]

CURTIS:
Oh my. That last sketch was a riot.

JOEL:
I sure had fun.

CURTIS:
I did, too.

JOEL:
A riot.

CURTIS:
My heavens.

JOEL:
Good-ness.

CURTIS:
Oh mercy me.

JOEL:
Hey. That was fun, too.

CURTIS:
Kind of.

JOEL:
Well, now that we have -

CURTIS:
- without a doubt -

JOEL:
- thoroughly entertained you -

CURTIS:
- we now feel comfortable enough -

JOEL:
- to ask you -

CURTIS:
- to watch the next sketch -

JOEL:
- with the senses of a critic -

CURTIS:
-

Ideas for music video:
- A field of flowers. Woman running to singer in slow-motion. Singer lifts up hand to reveal giant pizza cutter. Woman turns and runs in horror.
- Video starts with man and woman (or maybe woman on phone) going through dusty old storage unit or garage. She lifts up dust cover to reveal APB posed at their instruments. "Oh, these old things. Used to love them as a kid, but they're actually kind of creepy." She leaves, band comes to life, song starts.
- Singer keeps trying to perform romantic gestures but they always come off as creepy/murderous/lacking any empathy or understanding of romance. Also, throw in as many pizza references as possible. Maybe at one point she feeds him a strawberry and he shoves pizza in her face.

Misc. Ideas:
- APB are anthropomorphic animal robots whose fur has decayed over the years, revealing the horrifying machine parts underneath.


[CURTIS, STEPH, and JOEL. An easel with a large sketchpad, turned to a blank page.]

C: The collapse of the American financial market.

[Joel turns the page. A fairly crude graph representing the market.]

S: The world economy in peril.

J: Bad stuff happening.

C: And the question on everyone's mind, we know --

S: The reason you came here tonight.

J: Yup.

C: We're all looking for some measure of financial security.

Our sketches are currently worth virtually nothing and are guaranteed not to further decrease in value.

CORPSE
Dead.

AMPUTEE
I can’t. No matter how I try, no matter how I pray, I have to learn to accept the fact that I can’t. And I won’t. Ever again.

CORPSE
This is everything.

[ Beat. ]

CORPSE
Being dead is, I mean. It fucking rocks.


SEX HATS



These are sex hats.

Sex hats, you say?

Sex hats!

Which are?

The closest comparison I could make, without thinking about it, would be to hats. Sex hats are a little like hats, but with the one difference.


A man gets a phone call on his birthday. "Got any plans?" "Uh, yeah, me and a couple of my best friends are hanging out." Cut to a shot of two inanimate toys. Later, the toys "give" the man gifts. "You guys! I said no gifts!" The man has clearly bought and wrapped the gifts himself.

One toy doesn't show up, and the man gets very upset. "Where are you Negatron? Why didn't you come to my birthday Negatron? "

LONGEST EYEROLL EVER

[ DUDE and DUDETTE sit at a coffee shop ]

DUDE:
Dude, I think I'm gonna go to the Arcade Fire show this weekend.

[ DUDETTE executes the longest eyeroll ever. ]

DUDETTE:
Whatever, dude.

[ Dude looks displeased. Beat. ]

DUDE:
I think maybe we should break up.

DUDETTE:
WHY?!?!?!

[ Immediate cut to black. ]

Guy is thinking and does something funny. He laughs. Guy 2 walks in. “what’s so funny?” Guy describes what happens. Guy 2 does something funny. They laugh. Guy three walks in. “What’s so funny?”

This goes on for too long.

The stage is filled with people.

It finally turns towards the audience.

[ start with a vaudeville routine involving lots of takes, double takes and triple takes ]

NARRATOR
That was the classic “Slap your Pap” routine, an old vaudeville classic. Invented by Dinky and Potato in 1924 for the World’s Fair, it took the nation by storm, spawning hundreds of knockoffs throughout the vaudeville world. Simple yet sweet, combining Dinky’s expert comedic timing and Potato’s lightning quick reflexes

DUCKY “FRANK” NACHEZ
A lot of people won’t catch this, but that routine uses the famed “left take”. Before 1924, no one had ever taken to the left. All takes were to the right.

NARRATOR

I'm excited to hear what you've got for me. Everything I've heard says that you're a grade A idea man.

That's me.

Our company is an idea company. We value ideas.

I myself take ideas very seriously.

So tell me, what's your vision for us?

ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN

PROSECUTOR:
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

No doubt we're going to hear the name "Father Dowling" today. In fact, I suspect that the defense will bring that name up many times during this trial. So why don't I do them a favor and let you know who Father Dowling is? Father Frank Dowling is a Catholic Parish Priest

A personal-injury lawyer ad where the lawyer goes into way too much detail about the prices for his/her services. "My client spent $14,552.43 in one week dealing with me, and I didn't even win his case!"

An intervention.

“Chad, Sheila is going to read a letter she’s written about how your stupid face has affected her.”

[ Curtis, Courtney, and Joel stand facing the audience. They begin to ready themselves for a night on the town. ]

COURTNEY
It’s time to get ready, ladies.

AFTER THE BOMBS



[ LIGHTS UP ON A RAGGED GROUP OF SURVIVORS. ]

MAN 1:
... the fact is, we don't know what dangers are out there. We're still alive. That means there are other survivors out there. Some of them may be friendly. But some of them probably aren't.

WOMAN:
Then we stick together. No matter what.

MAN 2:
Agreed. We work together. We survived for this long as a group.

[ MAN 2 puts his hand out. WOMAN puts her hand on his. MAN 1 places his hand on hers. ]

MAN 1:
Then a group we shall stay. We're going to need more weapons.

MAN 2:
I'm going to start a list.
